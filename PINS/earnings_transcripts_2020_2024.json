A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders which are distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Just a short while ago, we announced our results for Q4 in all of 2020. Since it\u2019s a new year, I\u2019m going to spend a bit more time than usual reviewing our progress and looking forward with our strategic priorities. Todd is going to then follow-up with more about the financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. I'll start by saying that I feel good about our progress in 2020. It was obviously a trying year for everyone because of the pandemic, as well as some of social and political unrest, and our company had to adapt quickly. I want to start by saying a huge thanks to our team for their resilience and dedication as the results show the hard work paid off. In Q4, monthly active users grew 37% year-over-year to $459 million. Revenue in the quarter grew 76% year-over-year to $706 million, and we were profitable on a non-GAAP basis for 2020. We're proud of this progress, and we're focused on continuing to deliver on our mission. Now, as I told you before, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. And it's never felt more important than it is now. We hear this from folks all the time. People need a place to dream and be optimistic, away from politics and bad news. They need a space to focus on themselves based on what they want to do, not what other people will like. And businesses want to reach people early in the planning process before they decide what to buy for their lives. Even creators are telling us that they want a place to be more than just entertain, they want to be able to enrich other people's lives. So with that in mind, I want to share with you our four priorities for 2021 designed to advance our progress against that mission. The first priority is inspiring content. For us, everything starts with inspiration. It's why people come to our service. It's why businesses come to connect their products and services with the people who love them. And so we want to continuously evolve the way that we inspire our users. Historically, we've empowered Pinners to bring their favorite content from the web onto Pinterest. Today, we continue to invest in emerging formats like video, which represents dynamic new ways to deliver inspiration, like how to tutorials, incredible storytelling from brands. We're also now expanding our focus to bring the most inspirational people onto Pinterest, creators. Thanks to creators, Pinners can learn recipes directly from great chefs, get home decor tips from interior decorators, or get style tips from incredible fashion designers. At the end of last year, we introduced Story Pinners to creators a new way to publish short form multipage content. And stories are different on Pinterest than other platforms. They're less about what somebody else did, and they're not as focused on entertainment. They're more about you, what the pinner could do to enrich their own lives. And we're seeing this happen across a number of categories. For example, in the shareholder letter, we highlighted a personal trainer, Dennis Dixon. Last year, he used Story Pins to show simple workout routines to do home with ordinary things like a laundry bin. And his content has been viewed more than 10 million times, which is positive for his brand and it's great for our Pinners. We're just getting started here. We've learned from our investments in both video and shopping on Pinterest, but it takes time to reach scale and broad adoption. But it's ultimately worth it because it delivers a richer experience for Pinners. The same can be true for our work with traders and that's why we're committed to this for the long-term. The second priority is deepening the Pinner experience. Last year, we talked about making Pinterest more useful and introducing people to more use cases. We made progress. We improved the relevance of recommendations. We brought in more diverse content. And with features like the Today tab that offer inspiration relevant to that day. This year, we want to expand that focus. We want to make sure that whatever way a Pinner goes in their journey, they will have a first-class experience. It means new technology and products to improve how folks explore and find products they'll love with shopping tools, visualize and plan their futures with boards and new AR products like eye shadow try-on feature that we just launched, and collaborate with others on projects with features like dates and notes. Of course, Story Pins will be part of this, too. And finally, we'll continue to focus on content safety, so the Pinners can do all of this in a positive environment, free from so much of the negativity you see in other places online. Our third priority is helping advertisers succeed. One unique aspect of Pinterest is that people often come to plan early, sometimes months ahead of time And it's an opportunity for businesses to reach consumers before they made their decisions. Unlike other services, where ads are sometimes seen as a distraction, ads on Pinterest can actually enhance the user experience because people come there with the intent to buy things for projects like remodelling a home or buying a new outfit. And relevant ads for businesses help them discover what they want. So making advertisers successful is critical to achieving our mission. That means continuing to invest in automation and tools to make it easier to advertise and meet goals, that means scaling our sales team significantly to bring on new advertisers, investing in content safety, so that brands are showcased in a positive space, and finally, offering more insights about future trends to help advertisers get the most value for the dollars. The fourth and final priority is shopping. To us, our mission isn't complete unless we help people create the life they dream about offline. And so often being able to buy the ideas they see is what makes that action possible. Last year, we made progress in the shopping front. We made it easy to switch directly into shop mode from the search query. So we introduced new features from merchants, all of which led to a 6x increase in shopping advertisers on Pinterest in Q4. This year, we\u2019re planning to build on this momentum by continuing to help more businesses get their products on Pinterest, and help Pinners discover, evaluate and buy products throughout their shopping experiences. Finally, we want to expand these features more globally, so that no matter where you live, you can shop on Pinterest. So that's a brief look at the four priorities for the year ahead. We're excited about progress, but more excited about the opportunities ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Todd to expand on the financials.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I'll now go into some further details on the trends we saw in Q4 as well as to provide a preliminary outlook for Q1. We'll start with a quick summary of the headlines and then go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we had a very strong fourth quarter. Revenue grew 76% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Monthly active user growth remains strong with all major regions once again growing in the double digits. Ben mentioned this earlier, but I want to echo it as well, because it's a tremendous achievement. We added over 100 million monthly active users globally in 2020, that's more than we've ever added in a year. It's incredibly exciting to see so many people searching for and finding inspiration on Pinterest. Looking ahead, we expect our revenue to grow in the low 70s percent range year-over-year in the first quarter. We also expect to maintain our total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter at a similar level compared to the fourth quarter. There were two primary drivers to strength in Q4. First, and similar to the third quarter, our strategy is working and our team is executing well. The investments we've made in technology and then sales coverage are continuing to pay off. Over the last year, we've invested in our ability to better deliver returns accountable performance advertising, including scaling, conversion optimization, ads, shopping, ads, and building improved automation to help advertisers of all sizes more easily onboard and realize the value of being on Pinterest. We also expanded our sales team in Western Europe to monetize our engagement there. Drilling down, auto bid was once again a meaningful contributor to our strength in Q4 and was especially so for small, small and medium sized businesses. And I'm pleased that our international business grew 145% year-over-year on the back of strong advertiser demand. International markets now represent 17% of total revenue. Given this momentum, we plan to continue to invest to best serve Pinners, merchants and advertisers against the key priorities that Ben mentioned earlier. Stuck beyond our own investments, a strong overall online holiday season drove healthy advertising demand. We saw broad based strength across advertiser verticals, sizes and objectives, with the biggest improvement and growth from retail advertisers. Importantly, our team executed well against this backdrop. Our sales and marketing teams built an insights led go-to-market program over the course of 2020 that helped us deliver against Q4 seasonal moments. This program showcased the commercial intent of our users and helped businesses create better performing campaigns through the holiday season as a result. That helped prepare advertisers for the earlier start to holiday shopping this year, and continue seeing results as the shopping season persisted longer this year. Let me give two examples. The Lego Company created a holiday campaign based on popular search terms on Pinterest. Seeing increasing search trends for creative kid\u2019s gifts allowed the Lego Company to tailor and serve ads at the right moment ahead of the holiday season. Another example is the luxury Coffee Company, Nespresso. They partnered with our teams to uncover key consumer trends around the holiday season, including search trends, and consumer intent around holiday gifting, coffee recipes and seasonal flavors. With a better understanding of both auction dynamics and pinner behavior, Nespresso delivered effective advertising campaigns that also showed positive results and a third party brand lift study. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q1, we expect to grow revenue in the low 70s percent range in Q1. As we think about Q1 in the full year, we expect positive trends from our investments in add tools like shopping and automation, and sales coverage expansion to continue. We plan to expand our international coverage further in existing geographies, and also expand monetization into Latin America in the first half of the year. We also want to be mindful that we'll be navigating a fluid landscape, we're keeping an eye on a few things. First, the impact of COVID on users and engagement. Since COVID appeared, we know that more and more people have come to Pinterest to find inspiration. We could see some of that reverse if restriction leaves. Second, changes to privacy in the measurement landscape. This could impact the industry's ability to attribute conversions or serve relevant content. Finally, before opening it up for questions, I want to touch on expenses. We continue to navigate a more remote working environment while maintaining investments in the long term strategic priorities of the company. In the fourth quarter, we grew headcount 15%, year-over-year. As we look to Q1, we expect to maintain our total non-GAAP operating expenses at its similar level compared to the fourth quarter driven by investments in our key strategic priorities, including content, engagement, advertiser success, and shopping. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of the key verticals driving the incredible growth in advertising that we saw this quarter. Obviously, e-commerce was incredibly strong market-wide. How much of a factor was that given the transactional nature that the Pinterest sort of Pinterest participates in? And then as we think about the opportunity internationally, how have you seen the current environment and certainly the acceleration in - or the return of lockdowns in those markets impact Pinterest adoption by advertisers in the markets where you've began to roll out monetize your sales force?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Heath. So on the vertical question, I heard two questions in there. One was around verticals. And then the second was on lockdowns, particularly internationally. I'd start with really the retail vertical like I called out in the opening remarks. We had a longer holiday shopping season this year than we've seen historically. And that built around seasonal moments tended to coincide with a big return of demand in retail. So that was the biggest driver. But we saw strength across really every vertical. Travel still is a lag laggard. But in general, retail, CPG and a number of other verticals really performed well. We saw strength across objectives. We saw strength in large advertisers through the small and medium-sized advertisers. So it was a remarkably strong Q4, but anchored by the longer holiday shopping period with an emphasis on retail. On the lockdown point, that's why I want to call out some of the issues going into this year. The COVID environment impacts our user growth and impacts engagement trends and then it impacts the ad market. What I would say is that we saw a great strength in international markets. As we mentioned, we've grown \u2013 we grew in the fourth quarter 145% year-over-year, which was remarkable performance and coming on the back of scaling those teams and putting in place a great playbook. It also \u2013 it is also a situation where a team had to navigate a very dynamic COVID environment. And as you referenced as markets open and close, that impacts demand to some extent, but we were able to navigate through that to still post remarkable growth in the fourth quarter. If we were to see lockdowns persist through the course of the year, that may create some uncertainty, but our guide reflects what we know today.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just following on what Ben said during his prepared remarks and a lot of progress made in 2020. Can you just sort of lay out for us what you see as some of the key investments you need to keep making it 2021 and 2022 and beyond? When you think about the opportunity sets that sit in front of you, whether it's geographic, or product or sort of unlock on the demand side, and help us better understand how you're going to align investments against realizing that potential in the coming years? Thanks so much.\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Eric, I'm happy to. Let me just start by saying, we have a long roadmap ahead of us on both the consumer side and as well as on the advertising side. And I'm going to start on the consumer side because, that's where a lot of the investments start. The first thing I mentioned is that we're going to continue to innovate on the form in which people get inspiration. And this is really important. We've made long-term investments in video and we've seen that reflected, as Todd mentioned, in a significant uptick in video views and uploads. And then, we're beginning to expand that by enabling traders to publish directly onto the platform. That's going to be a long investment. But we think that it can continue to drive digital experiences for users both in the U.S., but also internationally where some of the web content ecosystems that the U.S. relied upon are less mature. So that's a significant focus. We talked a little bit about the areas of engagement that we're going to be driving by improving the product and making it more useful. And then finally, we'll continue our investment in shopping. And so, look, core to our mission is that we see shopping as this bridge between the two halves of our mission, inspiration and action. And so, for Pinners, we've made progress by expanding the number of surfaces to let them shop. And we have things like search tools like lens, the ability to shop for boards, or the ability to shop trends. And we saw a significant uptick in product search in 2020, it went up about 20x last year alone, we need to continue that. On the merchant side, we want to continue to invest in catalog upload, it would include storefronts, new ad formats like dynamic collections. But all of this is after a pretty simple experience where somebody can go from inspiration to purchase as seamlessly as possible. So those are sort of the big bets on the consumer side. And then as you noted on the advertiser side, all of those follow as well. So in 2020, we introduced a lot of tools to support a diversified advertiser base, really focused on making it easier for mid-market advertisers, and manage SMBs to scale their spend. So that's why we repeatedly talked about automation. Moving into 2021, one of the big areas that we're focused on is driving more relevant ads, and we're going to do that by growing the number of advertisers. We think that if we can provide really relevant ads, especially in surfaces like search, it's a win-win. It helps consumers because they're seeing inspiring content relevant to what they do every day. It's great for advertisers, because they're finding consumers who are really looking for inspiration, but they haven't yet decided exactly what they're going to buy. So to do that, there are a bunch of areas that we\u2019re investing in. On the tool front, we want to make Pinterest easier to use, easier to deploy your budgets at scale, and easier to get results. So examples of investments there, a continued investment in automation, investment in agency tools, and this is especially important internationally where agencies control a lot more of the spend. It's the number one pain point is having a better agency tool. And then finally, partners and integrations finding ways to both new merchants and help them on board as easily as possible. On the measurement front, we want to be more accessible, comprehensive and better with our first-party insights. And so in Q4, we expanded conversion insights, which let you understand paid and organic GMV together. We provided Pinterest conversion analysis, which provides a suite of reports and helps advertisers measure the impact of longer attribution in days and we continue to invest in first-party insights. We just introduced, for example, brand list studies, first-party, that just make it easier for advertisers of all sizes to measure the impact of their awareness campaigns. So think of measurement as an evergreen investment for us because the industry environment is constantly changing. And last but not least, formats are important for advertisers. We've already talked a little bit about investment in video. And we're also going to invest in sponsored story patents over time. So as we grow the creator's ability to publish stories, we want to enable them to monetize that. So I know that's a lot. That's a broad overview, hopefully, the framework of those four priorities I provided up top, can kind of help us kind of guide how those investments but you'll be hearing a lot more about those priorities for us in the subsequent year. And we're looking forward to make an experience that much better for Pinners and for advertisers.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much, Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. Two questions. So obviously big progress on the user growth this year. One of the concerns was the demographic Did you see progress, like expanding demographic out of your core this year? Anything to comment there? And where do you Ben see the next half a million half a billion users coming from? And then maybe one for Todd, with the privacy concerns? Does this, cause you to maybe try to accelerate activity first party activity, and shopping on Pinterest versus other platforms? Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Sure Justin, let me start off on talking about user growth. So we saw really strong user growth in the U.S. and globally. As a reminder, we had a 10 million U.S. monthly active users in 2020 [h] last year. And in terms of specific segments, we saw real strength with Gen Z. So once again, people that are under 25, move faster than the overall population, we see that as a positive sign. We see that these users, they want more spaces where they can explore their own interests and hobbies. And they feel well served in connecting with social platforms and with their friends. But there's a real desire to have new ways to explore their own interests. In terms of the next wave of growth, and one obvious area continues to be international growth. While we've seen really, really strong growth patterns there, we still are relatively underpenetrated, relative to the number of internet users that are globally. Some of the investments that we're making in 2021, are not directly after growth, but we think will benefit international growth in the long term. And when we execute them, well, things like a shift overall to video, which increasingly is the default format that people use to get inspiration, as well as the ability to share inspiration directly and publish with tools such as story pins. As a reminder, when Pinterest started, we really enabled people to curate the web. But the web ecosystem in the U.S. was far more mature than in some other countries where we're starting to grow. And so the ability to publish natively on your phone, and in particular, the use of video, we think represents over the long term, a really compelling growth opportunity. The final thing I'll say is that we don't think of things like shopping as direct drivers of growth. But people want to use useful products. And as useful as it is to see inspiration. It's that much better when you can go from something inspiring the scene to a product from a retailer that you trust at a price that makes sense for you. So as we begin to roll out shopping features internationally, as well as just mature those features so they're more consistent and experiences that much better. We think over time that utility will attract more users.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. So on, Justin, thanks for the question on privacy issues. And I guess, and then since this is coming up a fair amount these days. I would summarize by saying that we're investing to address this issue in ways that we can control. But conversion visibility is likely to get tougher. And this is not a surprise. We've been talking about this for some time, the privacy, privacy and regulatory environment has been evolving over the last period of time here, so what are we investing in? I think you nailed it first party signals important. And while we're less mature than other platforms on this front, our roadmap in 2021 starts to chip away at the gap around converging visibility, and in terms of things that we can invest in and deliver from an R&D perspective. There are headwinds as many people have been commenting on Apple's new rules and the enforcement around those rules and the opt in rates from users will impact the extent of any headwinds that we see in the industry and we're keeping our eye on that. So there are trends in both directions. One, we have an opportunity to continue to build out measurement given where we stand relative to others in the industry, but we have headwinds.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple of questions from me. I guess first off, just given the success with shopping content and advertising in Q4. I mean, it sounds like it's still early days in the opportunity. But hoping you will provide a little more context on the growth in shoppable inventory, and maybe the rate of ingestion of listings some product catalogs. And then as a follow-up to Justin's question on privacy, just curious, I think we all gather the fact that with direct response advertising that a search orientation has advantages relative to some of the other advertising models. And it seems like Pinterest would be in a relatively advantaged situation from that perspective. Just curious if you agree with that? Or are there other factors that we should be considering? Thanks.\nBen Silbermann: Colin, I'll take the first part of the question. And maybe, maybe Todd can take the second question. So just stepping back and the shopping is indeed really important. And as you said in previous calls and the strategy is really twofold. On one side, we want to make sure that there's great shoppable inventory from great retailers with up to-date metadata. And then once we have an inventory, we want to be able to seamlessly move our users from inspiration, whether that's while they're searching, while they're browsing, or they're using a product that blends into their shopping experiences. So your question was more specifically about the growth in shopping inventory. Looking in -- going from Q3 to Q4, we increase the number of active catalogs by over 60%. And we also have really improved the discoverability of those products. And so in Q4, we expanded the scope of shopping engagement. And we allowed Pinterest to pivot into that shopping mode from any search query. That's resulted in a really significant uptick in product search. It's grown roughly 20x in the last year. But I do still think that we're in early days. We're certainly in early days in terms of international rollout. But even from a user experience side, while we've made a lot of progress, we still have a gap to close before we reach that vision of being able to go from an inspiring scene, or an inspiring video, or an inspiring story on directly to set up products that are easy to buy. And that's something that we're excited to invest in. Also say that on the advertising side, we do see shopping, advertising growing faster, as a proportion of our overall revenue growth. And it's just one example, Wayfair has really scaled their shopping campaigns with us over the past year, primarily because of measurement and the ability to drive incremental sales. So we think those are kind of great early indicators, but it is early days for us. And we're going to be working hard to improve that experience over 2021.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So Colin, on the second question about being advantaged because of the search characteristics of the platform, I would start by saying, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around this in general. So I don't want to overstate what we know. But what we do know about our platform is that we have high degree of commercial intent and planning behavior. And that planning behavior drives a fair amount of on platform signal. So things like board creations, things like visual and text based queries, saves, that are based on that planning behavior that creates a fair amount of on platform signal that helps to inform targeting. And so relative to other platforms, offsite signal is probably less important for us, because of the intent that we're able to capture first party on our platform. All that said, when you think about measurements, there are some products and improvements we can continue to make on that front, but that's where the ambiguity comes in. And I wouldn't want to overstate our position relative to others. But I think from a targeting perspective, we're in an enviable position based on the use cases and the planning behavior of our user base.\nColin Sebastian: Alright. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed it, but I was just hoping you could clarify a little bit around what you're seeing with volume and pricing dynamics, just kind of overall impression growth. And the degree to which you're also growing the advertiser base and how much that might be contributing to auction density, and what you're seeing on the pricing side there? Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Doug. So what I would say is we're seeing more balance these days in terms of both impression, growth and pricing growth, driving volume. So in the past we talked a lot about -- most of our revenue if not all of our revenue growth being driven by impressions, as opposed to effective CPMs or pricing. What we've seen and saw in the fourth quarter and through the course of 2020, is that -- there's far more balance. And now that we've started to see as we've been telling you over time, eventually pricing will start to contribute more to our revenue growth. And that's exactly what we're seeing. That's in part due to industry-wide demand, and auction pressure, we've continue to grow the number of advertisers on the platform and gotten more share of wallet with our incumbent advertisers, which has been important. And the most encouraging part about this, as well, pricing is increased across objectives. We've seen the most pricing opportunity and build end results in our performance. Against performance objectives, we were better utilizing or becoming more efficient in delivering against the ad inventory that we have. So it's not necessarily driven as much by cost per action, but by more efficient delivery of those slots, which is a really encouraging trend. I don't know if that gets to your question.\nDoug Anmuth: That's helpful. Maybe just a follow up on that. I think we've talked in the past just about the degree to which you're able to kind of have, let's say, contracted type of spending as you look out on the year, for example, an bigger partnerships with agencies. Anything that you can add there in terms of commentary, just as you think about 2021, perhaps how that's increase over the last couple of years?\nBen Silbermann: Yes. It's a good question. And it highlights one of the other issues that are raised about the uncertainty going into 2021. I would say a couple things. One, we're hearing really positive feedback from advertisers. We're hearing that ads are working, they really value the brand safety of the platform. And this is the year where we are really able to deliver value around the commercial intent of our users by packaging insights. Hence the insights trend that we've been talking about generally is getting out in front of consumer trends to help advertisers map their campaigns to that kind of behavior. And that creates both more relevant advertising, as well as better results for the campaigns for both from a user and an advertiser perspective. That's great. But in this COVID environment, what we're hearing from advertisers is they're looking for more flexibility. Long Range, large commitments are fewer and far between in this environment, but we're hearing a lot of feedback, positive feedback about wanting to spend, it's just less contractual than it was probably in prior years.\nDoug Anmuth: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, I appreciate the color on the increase in shopping advertisers in the fourth quarter. And then sort of the comments about the focus on growing the advertiser count. I guess, as you look into 2021, can you just sort of talk to us about the qualitative investments? So the areas that you really need to execute on, to continue to grow that advertiser count healthy throughout the course of the year, whether it's Shopify people, whatever it takes, just curious what we should be monitoring to grow that advertiser count? And then secondly, on the international side, can you guys give us some examples of technologies and ad products that are currently rolled to the United States that have not yet enrolled internationally that you think could help the international growth throughout the course of 2021?\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Brian. Let me start with your first question and Todd can chime if there are things that I've missed. The question is, I heard it is kind of one of the qualitative investments that we need to make as a company to grow the number of advertisers that can get value. And we've talked a lot about this, but part of the reason that we've focused so much on things like automation is we want Pinterest to be an easy place to buy, an easy place to spend and easy place to get really great results. And so we are going to continue to focus on investing in automation features, and that disproportionately benefits advertisers. They may have fewer resources to dedicate to Pinterest as a platform. So especially those midsize businesses that can kind of fill out the middle and long tail of advertising. That's a really, really helpful area. Related to that and actually related to your second question about what specific features we haven't rolled out globally, fully, that could be helpful. Really come down to things like those agency tools. So look, the number one pain point from agencies is actually only having full access options to manage business accounts versus granular permission access. So that being able to allow multiple people kind of in the agency to have access control. And that's really important. And so, we're looking forward to bringing that out later in the year. And then other thing internationally that we're doing is we're simply going to be opening up new markets. And what's enabling that is of hiring of sales teams in new geographies. Earlier, there was a question, I think, from Justin talking about, how we think about the growth of our user base. And historically and ongoing, we really think about growing markets where we see line of sight to monetizing them in the next few years. And so we're continuing on that plan. So as we continue to grow users in advertising markets that are mature, we then begin seeding and building teams in those markets. And then we end up opening the business in those markets. And we plan to open up more markets this year, which should be good long term trends for the business overall. Todd, anything to add there.\nTodd Morgenfeld: I think that covers most of it. But I think the only thing that I would add, that we're doing a little differently in international markets relative to what we've done in the U.S. is we're investing in that smaller and medium business cheer of advertisers more in parallel, internationally, relative to what we did in the U.S., which was more sequence. So a lot of what Ben talked about building on the product side will apply more directly to SMEs outside of the U.S. to quicker. We talked about the agency tools return beta, some shopping features will be rolled out more comprehensively internationally over time too. And that'll be important. And then on marketing, one of the things we haven't talked about here is on today's call, but its talked about in the past was our ambition to drive more comprehension of the product, which we think will benefit users engagement and the advertising market. Our expectation is that the deferred marketing spend that we were anticipating last year will be rolled out this year. And we'll do that not only in the U.S., but in key international markets to help set up Latin America. And then the next tier of markets, potentially deeper value markets in APAC. So I think Ben nailed it that those are a couple of other call points that I had.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions. First, just can you talk about how the improvements you've made in ad tools, like automated bidding have impacted same advertising spend, same advertiser spend, are you seeing existing advertisers scale up budget on the back of this in ways that can kind of build as adoption increases? And then second one, just kind of following up on Justin's question earlier, how do you guys think about bringing shopping activity more directly into Pinterest, similar to what we're seeing from some other players in the space? Seems like it could help with both attribution and the changing privacy landscape. So wondering if you thought about making more investment to really move it all on platform, anything you could share, that would be great?\nTodd Morgenfeld: I can start with your question on ad tools. And I don't know, Ben, you'd like to hit the second one. First of all, we -- I guess taking a step back, Lloyd, we saw growth being driven by new advertisers more prominently than existing advertisers this quarter, but there was a balance in growth from both. The biggest driver of that was our expansion internationally where we were starting to see Greenfield accounts come on board. So it's a natural thing to expect when we're opening up new markets. The fact that we are generating additional growth through existing accounts, and that was part of the contribution to overall revenue suggests that we're beginning to see some of that new budget that you described, but for sure, clearing existing budget better, because by taking the manual control out of those campaigns, and making them perform better, finding more efficient places for those ads, and more efficient rates on CPAs, that we've seen budgets clear more effectively. But we are seeing growth from existing accounts as well. I don't know, Ben, if you want to add anything on the shopping comment?\nBen Silbermann: Yes, Lloyd. I mean, I think maybe the question behind the question is, when is Pinterest planning to do things like made a checkout out, am I thinking of holding inventory if you\u2019re thinking about building a marketplace. And the answer to that is we certainly recognize that the friction introduced by not being able to easily check out. If you solve that and there's a big win there. But we don't have any products yet ready to announce on that front. We still are seeing a lot of returns and a lot of work candidly ahead of us around the couple of things that I mentioned before. One is increasing inventory by increasing the number of catalogs through partnerships such as the one that we have with Shopify, and intelligently matching that inventory to inspiring season and making it really easy for Pinners to make that switch, and sort of walk in that line between making sure that Pinterest feels inspiring, but when you are ready to buy, when you're excited about that scene or you're excited about that outfit, it's really easy to switch over and find where to buy it from a trustworthy retail or the price that makes sense to you. So definitely hear the spirit of the question. I'm more focused on those two priorities right now. And we'll let the community know when we're ready to announce something but nothing yet today.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. We have seen -- we're seeing basically every platform out there, really interested in coding creators. And I guess for investors given how you started out the call and Ben was sort of talking about creators. How should we understand like, why a creator comes to Pinterest versus an Instagram, a Snapchat or TikTok? What makes Pinterest unique from a creator\u2019s perspective? And maybe Ben or someone could just talk about the roadmap for helping those creators make money on Pinterest? That would be great.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. It's a great question. And I think that, the question is, what's in it for a creator? I mean, it actually comes down to, what's the heart of the difference between what people come to these platforms to do. So there are creators on lots of other platforms, social media properties, professional networks like LinkedIn. And creators really find ways to express themselves and are attracted to platforms that are aligned with what the users are there to do. So our users are there to do on Pinterest is that they're there to get inspiration to go do things in their life. And so, we're starting to bring on creators who want to be known more for the ability to teach how to do something than just shining a spotlight on what they're doing day to day. So more on actionable content, educational content, than pure entertainment content. And its a place for the both the Pinterest is tipped more towards that first category. And as a result of that, story pins, for example, on Pinterest, they don't disappear. Because if you're teaching somebody how to cook that great recipe or how to do that great workout, that could be as good today, as it is in the future. And so from the creator\u2019s perspective, you get a few things. So one is 450 million people around the world that are really excited about getting inspiration to go do something in real life. The second is, you're in an environment where there's a strong search dynamic, much more similar to a video centric place like YouTube, then more social centric place where things tend to be more ephemeral. And then over time, we absolutely do want to find ways to make sure that creators can be rewarded, and the best creators can often do what's in their future, which is maybe doing this full time. So we're experimenting with things like sponsored story things. But we are looking at a range of different revenue models that are aligned with what the creator is there to do. We launched our first example of a sponsored story pin; a great example to share is GR [ph] show. GR Show ran a campaign where they took one of their brands, Tinker Ray, and they paired up with one of our creators, Peter Som, who is a food and fashion creator. And they created gym drinks so Pinterest could learn how to make a cocktail at home in Q4. And so that's an example of how those two things can be really aligned. Our belief is that the same alignment in incentives between what Pinners are there to do and what advertisers are there to do, can offer new monetization opportunities between creators and advertisers as well. So as I mentioned at the top of the call, we're still in early days. You're right, it is a noisy environment out there. People are reading about this all the time. But we do think that we have a lot to offer. And we're excited about the progress that we're seeing.\nRichard Greenfield: And Ben, do you think you can create some form of marketplace where you can pair brands with creators, because I think that's a real challenge for brands figuring out like, who to work with on a given platform, obviously, you have a ton of data on what people are doing. How do you begin to match them up as a marketplace and obvious next step for Pinterest?\nBen Silbermann: I think it's probably too early for us to kind of predict exactly what we're going to release. But in terms of what you spoke about, which is that matching problem, definitely understand that that's a challenge. And if we can provide a positive, mutually beneficial relationship between creators, advertisers and Pinners, and there's a lot of value to be gained there.\nRichard Greenfield: Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys, just a question, Todd on the kind of the macro heading into 2021 for both Google and Facebook pointed to stable to accelerating growth in 1Q and 2Q. And I know you guys have stepped down as you get into March and April. So in the context of the low 70s it sounds like what you're seeing thus far in January, and we're not factoring in anything in terms of March or April in terms of an uptick. Just any color you can provide on what you're seeing right now and then maybe contrast, the brand versus DR side of the business?. That'd be great. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks Ross. This brand and DR, I'm just making a couple of notes in the macro. So heading into Q1 and the book signing about the momentum we have coming out of Q4. And if you take a step back, I think there are three themes that are persistent. One is that the strategy is working, Ben walked through a lot of what we're building from a technology perspective. But the goal of having an advertiser bring their budget, their goals and their content and having us automate the rest is something that we're early in the journey to deliver. But the progress we've made is resonating, especially in the mid market. The second big theme that will persist is the value of insights led selling. Because of the early commercial intent of our user base and our ability to increasingly package those insights while in advanced and seasonal moments and help advertisers design campaigns. It helps us deliver more relevant advertising and also better performance. That will persist. And the third is brand safety. So, that we saw this a fair amount during the election season. But in general, the secular trend around brand safety being important to advertisers will persist. So those are three things that I'm really excited about coming out of the back half of last year that we expect to persist. What's different about Q1, two things, one, we had a little bit easier compare, which will become more pronounced in the second quarter and then much tougher as we get into the back half of the year. But we benefit really strongly in the retail segment from that longer holiday season. And for platform that has a lot of retail exposure, and a lot of value delivered through that insights based selling on seasonal moments. In the fourth quarter with an unusually strong and longer shopping period, we just have fewer seasonal moments in the first quarter to sell again. So all those macro themes are there. But the number of seasonal moments and the particular strength we saw in the retail segment I think much longer than usual shopping period was probably related to us. On the brand awareness versus performance side, we continue to be majority performance objective stand. To what I would say is we saw a strength for a platform that is full funnel, where we take a user from inspiration to action, and we can map awareness objectives all the way through checkout objectives or shopping objectives. We saw strength across the board in the fourth quarter. It was everything from awareness objectives all the way through shopping and STPM performed exceptionally well. We are still predominantly performance oriented. But we didn't see any big shifts in span. In fact, it was just strong across the board and across all verticals.\nBen Silbermann: Hey, operator, are you still there? I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we think back on 2020 of the pandemic through wrench in everything, but one of the big goals as I understand it was driving incremental use cases for the users. And so, if we look below, I guess the monthly active user numbers, anything you could share about how successful that was? It certainly sounds like there was a lot of success bringing folks kind of across the funnel. But anything around those incremental use cases and other reasons to kind of use the Pinterest platform? Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Yes. That's a great question, Mark. So, we did see some success with use case diversification. Look, we also were benefited by the fact that a lot of people's lives changed pretty dramatically in 2020. And so a lot of these core use cases that Pinterest has been great at suddenly became that much more relevant for people at a time when they were working from home. You know, parents became teachers. People started cooking at home more and so we saw a lot of benefits from that as well. Now some of the use case work that we've done in the past, including things like search guides, and diversifying the results that we show and just improving the overall relevance. Those will continue as sort of evergreen investments. But the reason that we framed this year, to be more about overall, providing inspiring content because we see a lot of long term value and making sure that the format that people get inspiration in is the most inspiring format for the future. And so, there were three things that we've mentioned around that, that theme of more inspiring formats. One is video. And I think we've already covered that video grew tremendously last year both in terms of views and the number of uploads. And the second is making everything shoppable. And we talked at length about how we want to be able to people pivot from looking at that home office set us to buying all the things in it. And then the third, which is the newest is going to be this investment in story pins. So, I know that's a little bit of a long way of saying that use case expansion. We didn't see success in 2020. But looking ahead to 2021, we're going to be speaking more about providing more inspirational content in native formats as a way to drive a long term growth engagement on the platform.\nMark Shmulik: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for the question. I'll now turn the conference over to Ben Silbermann for closing remarks.\nBen Silbermann: Well, look, I just want to thank everyone for joining the call and for the thoughtful questions. As always, we look forward to keeping dialogue going. And I just wanted to also say that I hope everyone stays healthy and safe in the months ahead. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I'll now go into some further details on the trends we saw in Q4 as well as to provide a preliminary outlook for Q1. We'll start with a quick summary of the headlines and then go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we had a very strong fourth quarter. Revenue grew 76% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Monthly active user growth remains strong with all major regions once again growing in the double digits. Ben mentioned this earlier, but I want to echo it as well, because it's a tremendous achievement. We added over 100 million monthly active users globally in 2020, that's more than we've ever added in a year. It's incredibly exciting to see so many people searching for and finding inspiration on Pinterest. Looking ahead, we expect our revenue to grow in the low 70s percent range year-over-year in the first quarter. We also expect to maintain our total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter at a similar level compared to the fourth quarter. There were two primary drivers to strength in Q4. First, and similar to the third quarter, our strategy is working and our team is executing well. The investments we've made in technology and then sales coverage are continuing to pay off. Over the last year, we've invested in our ability to better deliver returns accountable performance advertising, including scaling, conversion optimization, ads, shopping, ads, and building improved automation to help advertisers of all sizes more easily onboard and realize the value of being on Pinterest. We also expanded our sales team in Western Europe to monetize our engagement there. Drilling down, auto bid was once again a meaningful contributor to our strength in Q4 and was especially so for small, small and medium sized businesses. And I'm pleased that our international business grew 145% year-over-year on the back of strong advertiser demand. International markets now represent 17% of total revenue. Given this momentum, we plan to continue to invest to best serve Pinners, merchants and advertisers against the key priorities that Ben mentioned earlier. Stuck beyond our own investments, a strong overall online holiday season drove healthy advertising demand. We saw broad based strength across advertiser verticals, sizes and objectives, with the biggest improvement and growth from retail advertisers. Importantly, our team executed well against this backdrop. Our sales and marketing teams built an insights led go-to-market program over the course of 2020 that helped us deliver against Q4 seasonal moments. This program showcased the commercial intent of our users and helped businesses create better performing campaigns through the holiday season as a result. That helped prepare advertisers for the earlier start to holiday shopping this year, and continue seeing results as the shopping season persisted longer this year. Let me give two examples. The Lego Company created a holiday campaign based on popular search terms on Pinterest. Seeing increasing search trends for creative kid's gifts allowed the Lego Company to tailor and serve ads at the right moment ahead of the holiday season. Another example is the luxury Coffee Company, Nespresso. They partnered with our teams to uncover key consumer trends around the holiday season, including search trends, and consumer intent around holiday gifting, coffee recipes and seasonal flavors. With a better understanding of both auction dynamics and pinner behavior, Nespresso delivered effective advertising campaigns that also showed positive results and a third party brand lift study. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q1, we expect to grow revenue in the low 70s percent range in Q1. As we think about Q1 in the full year, we expect positive trends from our investments in add tools like shopping and automation, and sales coverage expansion to continue. We plan to expand our international coverage further in existing geographies, and also expand monetization into Latin America in the first half of the year. We also want to be mindful that we'll be navigating a fluid landscape, we're keeping an eye on a few things. First, the impact of COVID on users and engagement. Since COVID appeared, we know that more and more people have come to Pinterest to find inspiration. We could see some of that reverse if restriction leaves. Second, changes to privacy in the measurement landscape. This could impact the industry's ability to attribute conversions or serve relevant content. Finally, before opening it up for questions, I want to touch on expenses. We continue to navigate a more remote working environment while maintaining investments in the long term strategic priorities of the company. In the fourth quarter, we grew headcount 15%, year-over-year. As we look to Q1, we expect to maintain our total non-GAAP operating expenses at its similar level compared to the fourth quarter driven by investments in our key strategic priorities, including content, engagement, advertiser success, and shopping. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Thanks, Heath. So on the vertical question, I heard two questions in there. One was around verticals. And then the second was on lockdowns, particularly internationally. I'd start with really the retail vertical like I called out in the opening remarks. We had a longer holiday shopping season this year than we've seen historically. And that built around seasonal moments tended to coincide with a big return of demand in retail. So that was the biggest driver. But we saw strength across really every vertical. Travel still is a lag laggard. But in general, retail, CPG and a number of other verticals really performed well. We saw strength across objectives. We saw strength in large advertisers through the small and medium-sized advertisers. So it was a remarkably strong Q4, but anchored by the longer holiday shopping period with an emphasis on retail. On the lockdown point, that's why I want to call out some of the issues going into this year. The COVID environment impacts our user growth and impacts engagement trends and then it impacts the ad market. What I would say is that we saw a great strength in international markets. As we mentioned, we've grown \u2013 we grew in the fourth quarter 145% year-over-year, which was remarkable performance and coming on the back of scaling those teams and putting in place a great playbook. It also \u2013 it is also a situation where a team had to navigate a very dynamic COVID environment. And as you referenced as markets open and close, that impacts demand to some extent, but we were able to navigate through that to still post remarkable growth in the fourth quarter. If we were to see lockdowns persist through the course of the year, that may create some uncertainty, but our guide reflects what we know today. Thanks, Ben. So on, Justin, thanks for the question on privacy issues. And I guess, and then since this is coming up a fair amount these days. I would summarize by saying that we're investing to address this issue in ways that we can control. But conversion visibility is likely to get tougher. And this is not a surprise. We've been talking about this for some time, the privacy, privacy and regulatory environment has been evolving over the last period of time here, so what are we investing in? I think you nailed it first party signals important. And while we're less mature than other platforms on this front, our roadmap in 2021 starts to chip away at the gap around converging visibility, and in terms of things that we can invest in and deliver from an R&D perspective. There are headwinds as many people have been commenting on Apple's new rules and the enforcement around those rules and the opt in rates from users will impact the extent of any headwinds that we see in the industry and we're keeping our eye on that. So there are trends in both directions. One, we have an opportunity to continue to build out measurement given where we stand relative to others in the industry, but we have headwinds. So Colin, on the second question about being advantaged because of the search characteristics of the platform, I would start by saying, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around this in general. So I don't want to overstate what we know. But what we do know about our platform is that we have high degree of commercial intent and planning behavior. And that planning behavior drives a fair amount of on platform signal. So things like board creations, things like visual and text based queries, saves, that are based on that planning behavior that creates a fair amount of on platform signal that helps to inform targeting. And so relative to other platforms, offsite signal is probably less important for us, because of the intent that we're able to capture first party on our platform. All that said, when you think about measurements, there are some products and improvements we can continue to make on that front, but that's where the ambiguity comes in. And I wouldn't want to overstate our position relative to others. But I think from a targeting perspective, we're in an enviable position based on the use cases and the planning behavior of our user base. I think that covers most of it. But I think the only thing that I would add, that we're doing a little differently in international markets relative to what we've done in the U.S. is we're investing in that smaller and medium business cheer of advertisers more in parallel, internationally, relative to what we did in the U.S., which was more sequence. So a lot of what Ben talked about building on the product side will apply more directly to SMEs outside of the U.S. to quicker.

And then on marketing, one of the things we haven't talked about here is on today's call, but its talked about in the past was our ambition to drive more comprehension of the product, which we think will benefit users engagement and the advertising market. Our expectation is that the deferred marketing spend that we were anticipating last year will be rolled out this year. And we'll do that not only in the U.S., but in key international markets to help set up Latin America. And then the next tier of markets, potentially deeper value markets in APAC. So I think Ben nailed it that those are a couple of other call points that I had. I can start with your question on ad tools. And I don't know, Ben, you'd like to hit the second one.

            "name": "Ben Silbermann",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Just a short while ago, we announced our results for Q4 in all of 2020. Since it's a new year, I'm going to spend a bit more time than usual reviewing our progress and looking forward with our strategic priorities. Todd is going to then follow-up with more about the financials and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll start by saying that I feel good about our progress in 2020. It was obviously a trying year for everyone because of the pandemic, as well as some of social and political unrest, and our company had to adapt quickly. I want to start by saying a huge thanks to our team for their resilience and dedication as the results show the hard work paid off. In Q4, monthly active users grew 37% year-over-year to $459 million. Revenue in the quarter grew 76% year-over-year to $706 million, and we were profitable on a non-GAAP basis for 2020. We're proud of this progress, and we're focused on continuing to deliver on our mission. Now, as I told you before, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. And it's never felt more important than it is now. We hear this from folks all the time. People need a place to dream and be optimistic, away from politics and bad news. They need a space to focus on themselves based on what they want to do, not what other people will like. And businesses want to reach people early in the planning process before they decide what to buy for their lives. Even creators are telling us that they want a place to be more than just entertain, they want to be able to enrich other people's lives. So with that in mind, I want to share with you our four priorities for 2021 designed to advance our progress against that mission. The first priority is inspiring content. For us, everything starts with inspiration. It's why people come to our service. It's why businesses come to connect their products and services with the people who love them. And so we want to continuously evolve the way that we inspire our users. Historically, we've empowered Pinners to bring their favorite content from the web onto Pinterest. Today, we continue to invest in emerging formats like video, which represents dynamic new ways to deliver inspiration, like how to tutorials, incredible storytelling from brands. We're also now expanding our focus to bring the most inspirational people onto Pinterest, creators. Thanks to creators, Pinners can learn recipes directly from great chefs, get home decor tips from interior decorators, or get style tips from incredible fashion designers. At the end of last year, we introduced Story Pinners to creators a new way to publish short form multipage content. And stories are different on Pinterest than other platforms. They're less about what somebody else did, and they're not as focused on entertainment. They're more about you, what the pinner could do to enrich their own lives. And we're seeing this happen across a number of categories. For example, in the shareholder letter, we highlighted a personal trainer, Dennis Dixon. Last year, he used Story Pins to show simple workout routines to do home with ordinary things like a laundry bin. And his content has been viewed more than 10 million times, which is positive for his brand and it's great for our Pinners. We're just getting started here. We've learned from our investments in both video and shopping on Pinterest, but it takes time to reach scale and broad adoption. But it's ultimately worth it because it delivers a richer experience for Pinners. The same can be true for our work with traders and that's why we're committed to this for the long-term. The second priority is deepening the Pinner experience. Last year, we talked about making Pinterest more useful and introducing people to more use cases. We made progress. We improved the relevance of recommendations. We brought in more diverse content. And with features like the Today tab that offer inspiration relevant to that day. This year, we want to expand that focus. We want to make sure that whatever way a Pinner goes in their journey, they will have a first-class experience. It means new technology and products to improve how folks explore and find products they'll love with shopping tools, visualize and plan their futures with boards and new AR products like eye shadow try-on feature that we just launched, and collaborate with others on projects with features like dates and notes. Of course, Story Pins will be part of this, too. And finally, we'll continue to focus on content safety, so the Pinners can do all of this in a positive environment, free from so much of the negativity you see in other places online. Our third priority is helping advertisers succeed. One unique aspect of Pinterest is that people often come to plan early, sometimes months ahead of time And it's an opportunity for businesses to reach consumers before they made their decisions. Unlike other services, where ads are sometimes seen as a distraction, ads on Pinterest can actually enhance the user experience because people come there with the intent to buy things for projects like remodelling a home or buying a new outfit. And relevant ads for businesses help them discover what they want. So making advertisers successful is critical to achieving our mission. That means continuing to invest in automation and tools to make it easier to advertise and meet goals, that means scaling our sales team significantly to bring on new advertisers, investing in content safety, so that brands are showcased in a positive space, and finally, offering more insights about future trends to help advertisers get the most value for the dollars. The fourth and final priority is shopping. To us, our mission isn't complete unless we help people create the life they dream about offline. And so often being able to buy the ideas they see is what makes that action possible. Last year, we made progress in the shopping front. We made it easy to switch directly into shop mode from the search query. So we introduced new features from merchants, all of which led to a 6x increase in shopping advertisers on Pinterest in Q4. This year, we're planning to build on this momentum by continuing to help more businesses get their products on Pinterest, and help Pinners discover, evaluate and buy products throughout their shopping experiences. Finally, we want to expand these features more globally, so that no matter where you live, you can shop on Pinterest. So that's a brief look at the four priorities for the year ahead. We're excited about progress, but more excited about the opportunities ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Todd to expand on the financials. Sure, Eric, I'm happy to. Let me just start by saying, we have a long roadmap ahead of us on both the consumer side and as well as on the advertising side. And I'm going to start on the consumer side because, that's where a lot of the investments start. The first thing I mentioned is that we're going to continue to innovate on the form in which people get inspiration. And this is really important. We've made long-term investments in video and we've seen that reflected, as Todd mentioned, in a significant uptick in video views and uploads. And then, we're beginning to expand that by enabling traders to publish directly onto the platform. That's going to be a long investment. But we think that it can continue to drive digital experiences for users both in the U.S., but also internationally where some of the web content ecosystems that the U.S. relied upon are less mature. So that's a significant focus. We talked a little bit about the areas of engagement that we're going to be driving by improving the product and making it more useful. And then finally, we'll continue our investment in shopping. And so, look, core to our mission is that we see shopping as this bridge between the two halves of our mission, inspiration and action. And so, for Pinners, we've made progress by expanding the number of surfaces to let them shop. And we have things like search tools like lens, the ability to shop for boards, or the ability to shop trends. And we saw a significant uptick in product search in 2020, it went up about 20x last year alone, we need to continue that. On the merchant side, we want to continue to invest in catalog upload, it would include storefronts, new ad formats like dynamic collections. But all of this is after a pretty simple experience where somebody can go from inspiration to purchase as seamlessly as possible. So those are sort of the big bets on the consumer side. And then as you noted on the advertiser side, all of those follow as well. So in 2020, we introduced a lot of tools to support a diversified advertiser base, really focused on making it easier for mid-market advertisers, and manage SMBs to scale their spend. So that's why we repeatedly talked about automation. Moving into 2021, one of the big areas that we're focused on is driving more relevant ads, and we're going to do that by growing the number of advertisers. We think that if we can provide really relevant ads, especially in surfaces like search, it's a win-win. It helps consumers because they're seeing inspiring content relevant to what they do every day. It's great for advertisers, because they're finding consumers who are really looking for inspiration, but they haven't yet decided exactly what they're going to buy. So to do that, there are a bunch of areas that we're investing in. On the tool front, we want to make Pinterest easier to use, easier to deploy your budgets at scale, and easier to get results. So examples of investments there, a continued investment in automation, investment in agency tools, and this is especially important internationally where agencies control a lot more of the spend. It's the number one pain point is having a better agency tool. And then finally, partners and integrations finding ways to both new merchants and help them on board as easily as possible. On the measurement front, we want to be more accessible, comprehensive and better with our first-party insights. And so in Q4, we expanded conversion insights, which let you understand paid and organic GMV together. We provided Pinterest conversion analysis, which provides a suite of reports and helps advertisers measure the impact of longer attribution in days and we continue to invest in first-party insights. We just introduced, for example, brand list studies, first-party, that just make it easier for advertisers of all sizes to measure the impact of their awareness campaigns. So think of measurement as an evergreen investment for us because the industry environment is constantly changing. And last but not least, formats are important for advertisers. We've already talked a little bit about investment in video. And we're also going to invest in sponsored story patents over time. So as we grow the creator's ability to publish stories, we want to enable them to monetize that. So I know that's a lot. That's a broad overview, hopefully, the framework of those four priorities I provided up top, can kind of help us kind of guide how those investments but you'll be hearing a lot more about those priorities for us in the subsequent year. And we're looking forward to make an experience that much better for Pinners and for advertisers. Thanks, Eric. Sure Justin, let me start off on talking about user growth. So we saw really strong user growth in the U.S. and globally. As a reminder, we had a 10 million U.S. monthly active users in 2020 [h] last year. And in terms of specific segments, we saw real strength with Gen Z. So once again, people that are under 25, move faster than the overall population, we see that as a positive sign. We see that these users, they want more spaces where they can explore their own interests and hobbies. And they feel well served in connecting with social platforms and with their friends. But there's a real desire to have new ways to explore their own interests. In terms of the next wave of growth, and one obvious area continues to be international growth. While we've seen really, really strong growth patterns there, we still are relatively underpenetrated, relative to the number of internet users that are globally. Some of the investments that we're making in 2021, are not directly after growth, but we think will benefit international growth in the long term. And when we execute them, well, things like a shift overall to video, which increasingly is the default format that people use to get inspiration, as well as the ability to share inspiration directly and publish with tools such as story pins. As a reminder, when Pinterest started, we really enabled people to curate the web. But the web ecosystem in the U.S. was far more mature than in some other countries where we're starting to grow. And so the ability to publish natively on your phone, and in particular, the use of video, we think represents over the long term, a really compelling growth opportunity. The final thing I'll say is that we don't think of things like shopping as direct drivers of growth. But people want to use useful products. And as useful as it is to see inspiration. It's that much better when you can go from something inspiring the scene to a product from a retailer that you trust at a price that makes sense for you. So as we begin to roll out shopping features internationally, as well as just mature those features so they're more consistent and experiences that much better. We think over time that utility will attract more users. Colin, I'll take the first part of the question. And maybe, maybe Todd can take the second question. So just stepping back and the shopping is indeed really important. And as you said in previous calls and the strategy is really twofold. On one side, we want to make sure that there's great shoppable inventory from great retailers with up to-date metadata. And then once we have an inventory, we want to be able to seamlessly move our users from inspiration, whether that's while they're searching, while they're browsing, or they're using a product that blends into their shopping experiences. So your question was more specifically about the growth in shopping inventory. Looking in -- going from Q3 to Q4, we increase the number of active catalogs by over 60%. And we also have really improved the discoverability of those products. And so in Q4, we expanded the scope of shopping engagement. And we allowed Pinterest to pivot into that shopping mode from any search query. That's resulted in a really significant uptick in product search. It's grown roughly 20x in the last year. But I do still think that we're in early days. We're certainly in early days in terms of international rollout. But even from a user experience side, while we've made a lot of progress, we still have a gap to close before we reach that vision of being able to go from an inspiring scene, or an inspiring video, or an inspiring story on directly to set up products that are easy to buy. And that's something that we're excited to invest in. Also say that on the advertising side, we do see shopping, advertising growing faster, as a proportion of our overall revenue growth. And it's just one example, Wayfair has really scaled their shopping campaigns with us over the past year, primarily because of measurement and the ability to drive incremental sales. So we think those are kind of great early indicators, but it is early days for us. And we're going to be working hard to improve that experience over 2021. Thanks, Doug. So what I would say is we're seeing more balance these days in terms of both impression, growth and pricing growth, driving volume. So in the past we talked a lot about -- most of our revenue if not all of our revenue growth being driven by impressions, as opposed to effective CPMs or pricing. What we've seen and saw in the fourth quarter and through the course of 2020, is that -- there's far more balance. And now that we've started to see as we've been telling you over time, eventually pricing will start to contribute more to our revenue growth. And that's exactly what we're seeing. That's in part due to industry-wide demand, and auction pressure, we've continue to grow the number of advertisers on the platform and gotten more share of wallet with our incumbent advertisers, which has been important. And the most encouraging part about this, as well, pricing is increased across objectives. We've seen the most pricing opportunity and build end results in our performance. Against performance objectives, we were better utilizing or becoming more efficient in delivering against the ad inventory that we have. So it's not necessarily driven as much by cost per action, but by more efficient delivery of those slots, which is a really encouraging trend. I don't know if that gets to your question. Yes. It's a good question. And it highlights one of the other issues that are raised about the uncertainty going into 2021. I would say a couple things. One, we're hearing really positive feedback from advertisers. We're hearing that ads are working, they really value the brand safety of the platform. And this is the year where we are really able to deliver value around the commercial intent of our users by packaging insights. Hence the insights trend that we've been talking about generally is getting out in front of consumer trends to help advertisers map their campaigns to that kind of behavior. And that creates both more relevant advertising, as well as better results for the campaigns for both from a user and an advertiser perspective. That's great. But in this COVID environment, what we're hearing from advertisers is they're looking for more flexibility. Long Range, large commitments are fewer and far between in this environment, but we're hearing a lot of feedback, positive feedback about wanting to spend, it's just less contractual than it was probably in prior years. Sure, Brian. Let me start with your first question and Todd can chime if there are things that I've missed. The question is, I heard it is kind of one of the qualitative investments that we need to make as a company to grow the number of advertisers that can get value. And we've talked a lot about this, but part of the reason that we've focused so much on things like automation is we want Pinterest to be an easy place to buy, an easy place to spend and easy place to get really great results. And so we are going to continue to focus on investing in automation features, and that disproportionately benefits advertisers. They may have fewer resources to dedicate to Pinterest as a platform. So especially those midsize businesses that can kind of fill out the middle and long tail of advertising. That's a really, really helpful area. Related to that and actually related to your second question about what specific features we haven't rolled out globally, fully, that could be helpful. Really come down to things like those agency tools. So look, the number one pain point from agencies is actually only having full access options to manage business accounts versus granular permission access. So that being able to allow multiple people kind of in the agency to have access control. And that's really important. And so, we're looking forward to bringing that out later in the year. And then other thing internationally that we're doing is we're simply going to be opening up new markets. And what's enabling that is of hiring of sales teams in new geographies. Earlier, there was a question, I think, from Justin talking about, how we think about the growth of our user base. And historically and ongoing, we really think about growing markets where we see line of sight to monetizing them in the next few years. And so we're continuing on that plan. So as we continue to grow users in advertising markets that are mature, we then begin seeding and building teams in those markets. And then we end up opening the business in those markets. And we plan to open up more markets this year, which should be good long term trends for the business overall. Todd, anything to add there. Yes, Lloyd. I mean, I think maybe the question behind the question is, when is Pinterest planning to do things like made a checkout out, am I thinking of holding inventory if you're thinking about building a marketplace. And the answer to that is we certainly recognize that the friction introduced by not being able to easily check out. If you solve that and there's a big win there. But we don't have any products yet ready to announce on that front. We still are seeing a lot of returns and a lot of work candidly ahead of us around the couple of things that I mentioned before. One is increasing inventory by increasing the number of catalogs through partnerships such as the one that we have with Shopify, and intelligently matching that inventory to inspiring season and making it really easy for Pinners to make that switch, and sort of walk in that line between making sure that Pinterest feels inspiring, but when you are ready to buy, when you're excited about that scene or you're excited about that outfit, it's really easy to switch over and find where to buy it from a trustworthy retail or the price that makes sense to you. So definitely hear the spirit of the question. I'm more focused on those two priorities right now. And we'll let the community know when we're ready to announce something but nothing yet today. I think it's probably too early for us to kind of predict exactly what we're going to release. But in terms of what you spoke about, which is that matching problem, definitely understand that that's a challenge. And if we can provide a positive, mutually beneficial relationship between creators, advertisers and Pinners, and there's a lot of value to be gained there. Hey, operator, are you still there? I think we have time for one more question. Yes. That's a great question, Mark. So, we did see some success with use case diversification. Look, we also were benefited by the fact that a lot of people's lives changed pretty dramatically in 2020. And so a lot of these core use cases that Pinterest has been great at suddenly became that much more relevant for people at a time when they were working from home. You know, parents became teachers. People started cooking at home more and so we saw a lot of benefits from that as well. Now some of the use case work that we've done in the past, including things like search guides, and diversifying the results that we show and just improving the overall relevance. Those will continue as sort of evergreen investments. But the reason that we framed this year, to be more about overall, providing inspiring content because we see a lot of long term value and making sure that the format that people get inspiration in is the most inspiring format for the future. And so, there were three things that we've mentioned around that, that theme of more inspiring formats. One is video. And I think we've already covered that video grew tremendously last year both in terms of views and the number of uploads. And the second is making everything shoppable. And we talked at length about how we want to be able to people pivot from looking at that home office set us to buying all the things in it. And then the third, which is the newest is going to be this investment in story pins. So, I know that's a little bit of a long way of saying that use case expansion. We didn't see success in 2020. But looking ahead to 2021, we're going to be speaking more about providing more inspirational content in native formats as a way to drive a long term growth engagement on the platform. Well, look, I just want to thank everyone for joining the call and for the thoughtful questions. As always, we look forward to keeping dialogue going. And I just wanted to also say that I hope everyone stays healthy and safe in the months ahead. Enjoy the rest of your day."

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, Madam.\nJane Penner: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest\u2019s earnings conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, our President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations. Now, I\u2019ll cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q4, 2020 are preliminary and may not be an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Jane. Hi, everyone. We appreciate you joining today. By now, many of you seen our shareholder letter. So just to offer brief comments that the quarter, Todd's going follow up with some additional details, and then we'll open it up to questions as soon as we can. I'll start by saying that we're happy with our performance this quarter. Q3 started with a lot of unknowns, because of COVID-19. But we were able to focus on what we could control. And that's executing our strategic priorities that we set at the beginning of the year, bringing on the most inspirational content, making Pinterest more engaging and useful, serving and diversifying our advertiser base, and finally making Pinterest more shoppable. All this led to strong results. Monthly active users grew 37% year-over-year to $442 million, and revenue grew over 58% year-on-year. We're seeing a number of our investments paying off, like growing our international presence in places like Western Europe, in our progress with automation to make it easier for small and medium sized advertisers, and finally making Pinterest more shoppable. We also launched a number of new products, like tools to help traders reach new audiences and bring even more inspirational content onto Pinterest. And more recently, a new suite of merchant tools to help retailers reach more customers this holiday season and beyond. Overall, we accomplished a lot. Now obviously, there's still a lot of unknowns in the future because of COVID-19. But I'm confident about our team's ability to innovate in the midst of all this change. And I want to give a quick thank you to the entire Pinterest team for their hard work in an unpredictable year. Apparently the resilience, the team demonstrated and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd who will give more color about our business performance. Todd?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I want to give some brief color on the trends that we saw during the third quarter as well as to provide an informal outlook for both revenue and costs going into Q4. I'll begin with a quick summary of the headlines and then we can go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we grew overall revenue 58% year-over-year, we also generated a positive 21% adjusted EBITDA margin. Monthly active user growth remained strong with all major regions once again growing in the double digits. We did experience a modest monthly active user uplift at the end of the quarter related to iOS 14 updates. Younger users in particular turned to Pinterest to find inspiration for customized backgrounds. We estimate this single use case drove an incremental 4 million monthly active users globally. Looking ahead, we expect these 4 million MAUs are more likely to churn in Q4 given the digital wallpaper is a relatively transient use case. Additionally, we expect our business to maintain its momentum in Q4, with revenue growing around 60% year-over-year. We saw much more demand for advertising services than we expected in Q3. There were three primary drivers of this strength. First, the investments we've made over the past year in technology, and then sales coverage are continuing to pay off. And the returns exceeded our expectations in Q3. Over the past year, we've invested in conversion optimization or OCPM ads, shopping, ads, and auto bidding to help diversify our advertiser base, and we also expanded our sales team in Western Europe to monetize their engagement there. These investments continue to pay off. Specifically, auto bid was a meaningful contributor to the strength in Q3, especially for small and medium sized businesses. And their international business grew 145% year-over-year now representing 16% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Given the enormous opportunity ahead of us, we\u2019ll continue to invest opportunistically to best serve pinners, merchants and advertisers. The returns from these investments may not always be linear, but we do believe we have a strong roadmap ahead in 2021 and beyond. Second, beyond our own investments, the macro environment is very supportive in Q3. Advertising demand improved overall, and we saw both brand advertisers and large retailers that have paused spend in Q2 returned to our platform. We also saw continued strength in the conversion oriented small and medium sized advertisers who gravitated to Pinterest in Q2 because of the native, commercial intent of our users, and because of the on-going secular shift toward e-commerce that has been accelerated by the COVID crisis. Our sales team was able to lean into these favorable conditions in Q3 helping to introduce advertisers to new tools and features, and operating with high efficiency overall. Our go-to-market effectiveness has also been bolstered by the unique insights that we're able to provide to advertisers. Advertisers increasingly depend on these insights to understand the leading indicators of consumer demand in this environment, which earns us both mindshare, and outspend. Third, we continue to benefit from marketers who are prioritizing positivity and brand safety. Advertisers tell us that Pinterest is brand safe relative to other consumer internet platforms. And we've benefited from this in Q3. Though, it's still not clear how sustainable this trend will be, particularly after the U.S. election is over. Turning to our informal outlook for Q4, I want to provide some color here as well. We expect that our momentum will continue in Q4 as many of the Q3 drivers persist into the holiday season. These include the positive trends driven by our investments in conversion and shopping ads, automation and international sales coverage. There are also two external unknowns that could impact our business. First, the impact of the COVID situation remains hard to predict both on user engagement patterns, as well as on advertiser demand. In addition to on-going uncertainty related to continued disease spread and lockdowns across the globe, our visibility into Q4 is further limited by uncertainty about the impact COVID will have on seasonal engagement and ad spend. Pinners may likely plan for the holidays differently, and it's hard to know how marketers will respond to these changes. The second unknown is the tailwind we've experienced from the advertiser boycott of social media that began in July. On one hand, this group of advertisers accelerated their spend on Pinterest in Q3. On the other hand, the attractiveness of a positive brand safe consumer platform may wane somewhat after the U.S. election cycle is over in November, so some of that spend may wane too. To be clear, we think the positivity of Pinterest is a long term competitive advantage for many reasons. But it's just difficult to predict near term advertiser behavior, particularly in an election season. Finally, our current understanding of how both of these unknowns will play out is limited given the Q4 advertiser demand is typically back end loaded in the quarter. Finally, before opening it up for questions, I want to touch briefly on expenses. We continue to navigate a more remote working environment while maintaining investments in the long term strategic priorities of the company. We took the steps to end a future lease obligation for the company during the quarter. To put a finer point on this, we believe a more distributed workforce will give us the opportunity to hire people from a wider range of backgrounds and experiences. In Q3, we grew headcount 19% year-over-year at a similar pace to last quarter. As we look to Q4, we expect to modestly grow total non-GAAP operating expenses compared to the third quarter. We will continue to invest in our key strategic priorities, including content, engagement, advertising, diversification, and shopping. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it, open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the lines of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thank you. You talk about making Pinterest more shoppable. Could you just try to relay that into how that should show up in the financials of the company? Does that lead to, is that something that causes inflation or accelerated growth in Ad rates? Well, how would from a financial perspective what's the impact? How do we see that? Thanks a lot.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So Mark, I think from the financial impact perspective, what we're trying to do right now in shopping is improve the inventory of shoppable products on Pinterest, and then improve the discoverability of those products over time to the investments we've been making. We've talked over the last couple calls about things like our success and ingesting more catalogs to get shoppable content onto the service. We've talked about partnerships that accelerate that work. And then we've talked about high intent shopping surfaces that we've been building and designing to make it easier for Pinners to find not only inspiration, but actually bring those items into their life. That's been the primary focus is the consumer experience. And what we've talked about over the last couple quarters is consistent with the way that we're thinking about it today. We'll eventually monetize that over time, but we're majoring in the consumer experience today and monitoring and leveraged revenue. Shopping oriented revenue is growing quicker than the overall business, but it's just a small contributor to the overall mix. I would expect that to be a driver over a longer period of time.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one in the letter, you mentioned that automated bidding for shopping launched in September. I was curious if you could just sort of give us a an early read on what you've seen from the automated bidding from shopping impact, and what is the overall advertising business growing in September. And secondly, you also talk about in fact you talked about sort of the roadmap, you talked about more tools to come in 4Q and in 2021. Maybe this high level, talk to us about some of the still existing friction points that you hope to solve for your advertisers over the course of the next 12 months? Thanks.\nBen Silbermann: Sure. There are a number of things that worked in the quarter. And I think we touched on a number of them in the opening comments, but I'll pause on the first one, which is that ads are working on Pinterest, right now and advertisers are, are telling us that ads are working. And it's in large part due to the investments we've made in technology that make it easier for advertisers to hit their goals on the platform. And so there are really two areas where we're seeing that. The first is around conversion activity. And especially in this environment, what we're hearing is that returns accountable performance formats to drive measurable conversions and online sales, particularly in the mid-market segment, are a sweet spot for us. We've been making those investments, we've talked about the work we've done on tag integration partnerships on making sure the tags are working, what we call tag health, building tools to deliver better insights, things like our Pinterest conversion analysis tool and our conversion insights tool. That work has been incredibly impactful. And we're seeing the results in the growth of our SMB segment, which really drove the ball, a significant part of our growth during the quarter. The second thing, and you touched on this is the vision for automation. You can imagine a world and this will take us a long time to deliver in reality. But the vision is that an advertiser brings us their budget, their goals and their content, and we automate the rest. We started chipping away at this over the course of the last couple quarters with our investments in autobid. It started with traffic objectives, several months ago, and over around 80% of our CPC, or traffic objectives are now running through automatic -- auto bid. We launched auto bid for conversion optimization in July. And we're now at 50 plus percent of revenue through auto bid on that format. And we launched the shopping, as you mentioned, in September and the uptake, there has been quick as well. So I think we've got a great road map ahead. I -- as I mentioned in the opening remarks, I don't know that the returns will be linear on those things. But the vision around making it easier for advertisers to on board and not do as much manual management of their campaigns is something that we think will drive long term returns for us.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks got two questions, if you don't mind. First, here the shareholder letter mentioned that the COVID cohort of users had even higher levels of retention and engagement in 3Q in previous cohorts, wondering if there's enough signal kind of beyond the pandemic factors that give you a sense of whether this is, kind of be durably more engaged, anything you could share there. And then just secondly, you talked about budgets expanding associated with the OCPM spend for automated bidding. Do you feel like there's capacity for those budgets to scale up meaningfully? Or are there kind of limits either an audience size or otherwise to just how much room is left for the kind of existing clients to unlock more budget through optimization, anything you can, you can share? That would be great.\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Lloyd. I can take the first part of your question. What I heard was, how durables we think that the cohort of users that have come on during COVID is what do we know about how they engage with the platform so far? What we know right now is that the people that used the joint Pinterest during this COVID period, and they do tend to engage at higher level across a basket of metrics, and then folks that joined at the same time last year, but there are a few things that we've learned that are kind of worth sharing. First we have seen that engagement tends to increase when lockdown order are in effect and decrease when orders are lifted. And so while we believe that they'll net out in the positive place, we think that there's some effect from people spending more time at home. And the things they're doing at home are often things they've done for years, but in a new way. We talked in the last earnings call about setting up a home office or home school. That even applies to things like seasonal events, where parents are trying to reimagine Halloween, or think about what is what are the holidays look like when, instead of having a lot of families over, it might just be your family for Thanksgiving or Christmas. The second thing that we've observed is that these users often come for a specific purpose. And therefore, use features like search more than more browser features like the home feed. And we think that that offers an opportunity, because search is obviously a high intent service, but it also raises the bar on the relevance of ads that we have to provide. That's why our long term strategy is around relevance. And one of the drivers of that relevance is increasing the number of advertisers that we can serve by making it easy for managed small and mid-sized businesses to work with interest. So I don't know that we have quantitative answer to your question, knowing exactly where engagement will net out, we assume there might be some erosion. But we do think that a lot of the early trends are positive, and we still see upside.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Lloyd, on the second part of your question on capacity, I think Ben hit on the most important point, which is around the high intent that we see on the platform and increasingly seeing search and related things activity, it's being an opportunity for us to bring more medium sized advertisers, more advertisers overall, but specifically, small and medium sized advertisers on the platform to continue to deliver relevant advertising against those interests. But to be even more kind of tactical about your, your question, what we're seeing right now is definitely more efficient spend through on existing budgets. So we're taking the manual nature out of campaign management and automating it to better returns for advertising partners, and better clearing existing budgets. And we're seeing early returns on those budgets increasing, but I would say it's too early to have a specific and clear answer to your question about where the limits would be on that.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys, nice job on the quarter. So Todd, it seems like retail is really cranking right now. And you're seeing a lot of adoption of tag and auto bidding and some of the new features. Can you parse out? I don't know if this is even possible. But you look at the growth rates that you were seeing before 3Q. And then, the growth rates that now you're seeing in, 50%, 60% range in third quarter after July? How much of that is because of some of these, new feature sets that are in the ad stack, versus just kind of a recovery and budget from macro conditions? And similarly, if we look at brand advertisers like in CPG, are they increasing budget because the overall environments better? Or are there also tools that they're using in the Pinterest ad stack to unlock that higher run rate, any color will be helpful?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, I mean, Ross, it's really hard to parse. I mean, I would love to be able to disaggregate that and say, we're getting X amounts from the technology investments we've made. We're getting Y amounts on demand returning from a macro perspective, or insights give us a certain amount and the brand safety equates to the remainder, in reality it\u2019s the combination of all the above. Ads are working. I think we went through this a little bit on Brian's question, but making it easier for especially medium sized advertisers to on-board and automate spending their budgets effectively against their desired online conversion and sales objectives has been a big driver for us. It's been driving our advertiser count up, and it's been a significant component of our growth story. We've seen a major impact just around brands CPG, advertisers and brand advertisers returning to the platform after a pause in Q2 and the return of retail, especially the larger omni channel retailers that have paused in Q2. We\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in the insights that we're bringing to advertisers. The notion that our commercial intensive our users translates into a leading indicator of where demand is going to go is really resonating. We're seeing that without advertisers like Hershey around Halloween at home, is as a trend. I think Ben may have mentioned that before. We had great conversations with Miracle-Gro around home gardening trends that enabled them to deliver much more effective advertising campaigns, powered by the insights that we delivered. Welch\u2019s is another example around summer celebrations and back-to-school where we were able to help them with their campaign management and creative to deliver a much more performance advertising campaign. So those insights are really differentiating and are causing a lot of traction with advertisers. And then finally, this brand safety concept, especially post July and the boycotts that we saw, I would imagine that we're seeing a sustained benefit just due to the election season. But I think it's a secular trend where advertisers want to be around positivity as they build their brands, and that that's contributing to our growth as well. That's what we're hearing. So it's a mix of product and technology, macro recovery, the insights that we're able to deliver, and the brand safety and positivity that Pinterest uniquely brings and the world of social media.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. On international ad revenue, definitely, we've made a lot of investments in the last 12 to 24 months, can you talk a little bit about when we should be expecting sort of yields from both investments and how the international opportunity on the monetization side continues to evolve versus what you've seen on the user and engagement side of the equation. And it turned out to an earlier question in the newer cohort of users, which seem to be younger skewing and interviewed during on the product or the engagement forum to keep those users engaged to keep that cohort evolving, just want to come back to see if there was any active management and sort of notification from our engagement that the company might be doing to sustain some of that? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Eric, I can take the first part. And then Ben can probably speak to the second. On international, I would say we have started investing more aggressively about a year and a half ago, to staff out offices in Western Europe and get direct coverage on the ground, beef up our teams and in English speaking countries outside of the U.S. And those efforts scaled in terms of the investments over the course of last year and then too early, the early part of this year. And I would say we're seeing those results. 125% growth in revenue in international markets is being driven really by a handful of English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and Western Europe, or from the world from 10% of revenue in the year ago, quarter to 16% of revenue now from international on this quarter. And the momentum we're seeing there has been remarkable. We're still staffing those, we're still hiring to staff those offices out as we believe those markets have presented a lot more upside even from where we are today. And so I feel very good about what we're doing from an execution standpoint. The teams are doing a terrific job building relationships with advertisers and delivering great results. And so that's been remarkable. And I you know, I see a lot of other opportunity for us beyond those markets. As we move forward, we're hoping to begin monetizing in the next region, Latin America in the first half of next year. And I think there's a lot more that we can be doing across our existing monetized markets outside of the U.S. and into new regions as the next few years unfold.\nBen Silbermann: And Eric, to answer your second question. It hasn't shown it\u2019s opening remarks that we saw a particular surge of young users following the iOS 14 release, as a lot of young people look to customize their phones. But that trend of users under the age of 25 joining and growing at a faster rate than users over the age of 25 is something we've seen for a couple quarters continuously. When we talk to these users, what they tell us is they're excited to have a place where they can get inspiration. They feel well served with wonderful tools they can use to keep in touch with their friends and follow celebrities. But Pinterest offers them something different, which is a chance to get inspiration on everything from what they wear to hobbies that they might have to future plans. Your question was what we're doing for these users in particular? We're doing a few things. First, the top priority for the company has been to make sure Pinterest is the hub for inspiring content. In previous calls, we talked about a really significant increase in video and young users really expect video is the primary way they get inspiration and we've seen a really fantastic growth in viewership of both organic and paid video. This quarter, we introduced new tools for people to publish videos stories and to capitalize on that trend. And then we also have some experiments that are in place. This week, we launched an iOS widget, which lets people take that inspiration, whether it's inspiring quote or inspiring styles and put it directly onto their phone. And we'll continue to try things to see how we can make the integration as useful and relevant, accessible to the Chinese as possible. So we do think that we pay close attention to that under 25 cohort, we don't see significant divergence of behavior, but they are they tend to be trendsetters. And so we monitor them closely and see what we can learn.\nEric Sheridan: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Levine from Pivotal Research.\nMichael Levine: I mean, I know there were a couple questions before guys around shopping traction. I'd love to hear maybe a bit of an update of how much of this is really seeing the big unlock around shopping partners like Shopify versus some of the internal efforts that you guys have made regarding catalog ingestion? And I guess the secondary question to that is, are you learning things from working with Shopify, that's actually allowing you to get smarter, as you're, you basically are doing more to on-board on your own?\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Mike I can, I can start and Todd can feel free to -- feel free to add on more. So, we've outlined for several quarters in a row that our shopping strategy really has two major goals. One is improving our inventory of reliable products. And so as you mentioned on improvements that we've made to retail its ability to upload their catalog, those do indeed have a really, really big impact. This quarter, we've released UI improvements to make it simpler, and we've increased the speed of uploading. We've also introduced things like scheduling, and all of those things really are about building a base, very, very high quality inventory, some trustworthy retailers with accurate pricing information. And Shopify has been part of that story. Shopify is home to some of the most inspirational retailers. And so we're really excited to be able to partner with them and really remove the friction from retailers that want to upload their catalogue to the audience on Pinterest that are really looking for inspiration. And do it with just one tap. So that's kind of that first part about inventory. And then the second part of the strategy is taking an inventory, how do we improve the discoverability of those products? And on Pinterest, we have a little bit of a different approach than what some people might call spearfishing. People on Pinterest start with something they want to achieve a scene of a living room, a scene of a look. And then they work backwards into the products. And we've been building dedicated shopping surfaces. So you can take that inspirational image, and then see that great catalog and inspiring inventory, some of which might come from Shopify or any of the other versions that we're working on. And that's been something that's been going really well, although we still have a long way to go. Over the last six months, the number of Pinners that are engaging with their shopping surfaces; it's grown more than 85%. So really, really significantly. And we're really working to balance and make sure that we start with inspiration. And then when you're ready to go ahead and make that purchase, you can do it really easily. The last thing I'd add is that we think that that trend ultimately will be global. And we just took our very first step internationalizing that in Q3 when we launched shopping in the U.K.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. I know that press release yesterday called out, inspiration led digital shopping. We've certainly talked on this call a lot about kind of some of the new features, brand pages, etcetera. So a lot of changes to the consumer product. If we think about some of the kind of loyalist users are the longer you know, the older vintage users, any color you can share and how they're adapting to all the product changes. I know the 85% number on shopping but any color and how they're engaging would be very helpful. Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks for the question, Mark. So I think there are two ways of looking at that question. The first is our new users engaging and using some of the new features we're launching. And the answer in general is a lot of the features we're building are things that our users have been asking us for, for years and years. So the number one user request for years is I see something, it looks great. I'm all ready to buy it, and then I can't find it and that's what's really driving our investments in shopping. Similarly, as the web has become more visual and more video based people have wanted a richer and more immersive way to experience those. And so while things like storage bins are very new, we're optimistic given the success we've seen. I did mention earlier that one thing we're observing is that some of our newer users use Pinterest more for search based. So it's still inspiration and visual discovery, but they're actually searching for specific things. And so if there was a difference, I would say, particularly the COVID cohort, in the more recent cohorts have been engaged more deeply in search. And so we're always looking to think, how do we take the areas that users are engaging with a lot and amplify them, but also share with them and parts of this service, they may not yet have had a chance to experience.\nOperator: Your next question comes from one of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: All right, thanks. Appreciate the time. With the concurrent trends of brand advertisers returning to the platform, as well as the launch of some of the more shopping or action related ad formats and tools, wondering what the rough split is now between brand and direct response. And then maybe as a quick follow up to a few of the earlier questions on catalog ingestion. I guess, given what appears to be an earlier start to holiday shopping this year, and it concerns around delivery. Does that mean that the newer shopping ads and OCPM are getting perhaps some unseasonal boost here in September, October than what you might otherwise expect in a normalized year? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the question. So on the first point on brands, versus performance advertising. We've long been majority performance oriented meaning traffic conversion optimization and shopping versus awareness advertising. We mixed a little bit more toward performance in the quarter. But in general, this is across the board strength, across our brands or awareness objectives all the way through performance. And I think that highlights one of the unique aspects of the platform that we often hear from advertisers is there's value in the full funnel experience going from inspiration and finding a new idea all the way through a transaction is something that's a powerful mix. And I think we're seeing the results of that. To your point on the shopping experiences, it's just really hard to, to know in this tough environment, how things will play out. And our Q4 has typically been pretty back end loaded in the month of November and December. We're definitely seeing shopping happening a little earlier probably than last year. But, it just remains to be seen how the rest of the quarter plays out and how the seasonal moments and they adapt. And if you think back to last quarter, we talked about back-to-school being a risk in Q3 and we ended up seeing a fair amount of back-to-school spend. It just happened in slightly different verticals and at different times, and a little bit more dynamically than what we had typically seen. So even in Q4 right now, the planning cycles, the dynamism around spend, and the flexibility and nimble nature that advertisers are bringing into this season is a little bit unprecedented for us.\nColin Sebastian: Alright, thanks, Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the question. I have two. First, just want to get some more color on the trend in ad load. I know you're more demand constrained and supply constrained, but how do you think about ad load in terms of where you are now versus where you could be over time. And then second, just on expenses, and kind of how this leads to 4Q EBITDA. [Indiscernible] to clarify Todd that you said expenses will only be up modestly 3Q to 4Q and with that am I wrong in thinking that your near-term margins could be significantly higher than your long term targets that you laid out last year, which I believe are 25% to 29%. Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Doug. So on the \u2013 I\u2019ll take both of those. On the admin [ph] point. We saw a mix of contribution from impressions and price globally in the quarter. So it was much more balanced in terms of the impact of price and volume on revenue performance. That\u2019s one way of thinking about your question. I think overall, the message is still consistent with what we started with when we went public, which is, this is a platform where ads if they're delivered to the right person at the right time can feel like content. And we're more constrained by relevance and advertising, then messaging or social media where ads are attacks on the experience. So for us, it's mostly about how do we how do we deliver relevant advertising content that speaks to the interests and the commercial intent of our users. One of the benefits of having high intent shopping service surfaces as an example is that we're better equipped to serve a higher density of advertising. If you're -- if you're on Pinterest to find home decor items, you probably welcome advertisements that are from a retailer that you trust with an aesthetic that matches your tastes, etcetera. So, I think we're, we're a little bit further along in the U.S. than we are globally, there's a ton of room globally on ad mode, we're probably a little closer to our guardrails in the U.S. than we are on a global basis. But there's a lot of upside, if we can continue to get more advertisers on the platform, continue to deliver high intent shopping surfaces, and through our technology, make sure we're serving the right ad to the right person at the right time. On expenses. When I thought about long term margins, we were thinking about them on an annualized basis. And you can imagine, in a seasonal business like ours, where Q1 revenue is quite, a small contribution relative to the annual amount and Q4 is much larger. As we go into Q4 that will typically be the highest margin quarter for the company over the course of the year. You're right that in a world where we grow our expenses, modestly, that margins would expand in Q4. And it's probably worth calling out to that even in the year ago quarter, we did some brand marketing tests to the tune of nearly $10 million of spend that we won't be doing this year. There's a lot of those sorts of investments that in this current environment we will revisit going into next year when we think they can be effective again. But things like travel, events, marketing spend over the last few months have just been expenses we haven't had to deal with in this environment. And we're looking for ways to continue to invest going in the next year that would be an items that we had deferred through this COVID period and marketing in particular was one of those. So yes, the margins can be higher, but on an annualized basis, we'll still be below our long term targets.\nDoug Anmuth: Understood, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: A couple of questions. First, can you help us understand if the category strength has been broad based or has been really concentrated in things like home? Or, cooking or something like that? Could you just kind of think about sustainability? And then second, you give an outlook for 60% in Q4, but that sounded like you're somewhat conservative in the back half. Is it fair to say you put some deceleration in your outlook as the quarter progresses? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: I can take the first part of the question, Justin. We did see kind of engagement across a number of our core verticals, food, home beauty, style. Predictively, there were some use cases that were less popular than they have been in the past. Things like people planning for big outdoor events, although, interestingly, we've started to see some uptick in that, as people might be looking forward to the future. So as I mentioned a couple times before, we're monitoring closely, the sustainability of engagement and how particularly that cohort of users who joined during the COVID period of engagements with the service, but we don't see a massive category shifts from that cohort in particular.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line and Rob Sanderson from [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the momentum. Positives for you, you spoke about several factors that limit your visibility into Q4, your back end loaded quarter. Not sure about the permanence of the benefit from brand safety, etcetera. Can you help us reconcile that with your guidance for about 60% revenue growth? Are you growing faster than that through October and forecasting some slowdown? Or how are you thinking about, those unknowns in the fourth quarter? And then also, any thoughts on the impact of having a few more shopping days during the peak part of the season this year? I don't think there was anything that slowed you down and last year having fewer days. But what was that? How are you looking at that that dynamic this year versus a year ago? Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks. And I know we skipped over the second part of Justin's question. But I think that was very similar to the one you, you just asked about the back end loaded nature of the quarter and momentum that we're seeing. And the reality is we're \u2013 and I think I can answer both of those. And then we can talk about shopping days. In general, we're seeing a lot of the same drivers in Q4 that we saw in Q3. As I mentioned before, the ads are working, our investments in technology and product are working around conversions and automation. We are seeing kind of the return of retail and continue to strengthen CPG advertisers. We're seeing a lot of appetite for the insights that we're delivering, which is sustained through Q3 into Q4, this brand safety narrative has continued to be you know, we talked about it on the last earnings call, we didn't really know if it was going to be a July phenomenon only or if it was going to persist. And if it persisted, would it persist past the election? It's persisted. And it seems to be something that's important to advertisers. But we'll see post-election how it plays out. And then the international strength that we've been seeing has been a source of upsides when we've talked about for a long time and then been investing in but it's played out nicely. So I'd say, we're seeing a lot of the same drivers that we saw through Q3 play out into Q4 and hopefully we'll, despite this weird environment that we're in, hopefully we'll see it play out. But those risks around how COVID impacts seasonal moments, how shopping behavior changes, how people celebrate those moments, how advertisers respond to them. Whether advertising around the an election that may be quite a quite a new cycle here in the next few weeks. How that plays out. Those are those are just uncertainties for us right now. On the shopping days point. We talked about that last year being a headwind and it didn't really play out that way. So I'm hesitant to call it in the other direction this year is upside. And so we'll see how it plays out. I do think we've seen shopping behavior start a little earlier this year. And I would expect that given that that maybe it doesn't matter how many, how many days are in the official shopping period between Black Friday and the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks very much. In the letter, you talked about the robust growth of video content on the platform. But wanted to kind of think about as you offer, and you talked about think how younger users kind of expect or table stakes is having more video content, how does that play into video advertising and sort of the CPMs that you can get for video ads and sort of what have you done in terms of early work around video ads, as you introduce more and more video content into the platform. And then just sort of stories that know you rolled out recently. I think it was mentioned sort of in passing in the letter, anything more you can add in terms of sort of early learnings or uses and just what are people doing with it that you know, excites you or how you're evolving the product?\nBen Silbermann: Rich, can you restore [ph] on that second part of the question. I missed the second part of the question.\nRich Greenfield: Sorry, on stories, as you kind of rolled out the story pins like, what do you see, I mean, it you sort of mentioned it in the release as a new format. But you can go into a lot of detail wondering if there's anything in terms of early learnings or what people are doing with it encouraging or what you need to change etcetera?\nBen Silbermann: Yes, I can I can start. So, yes, if we think that video is an ideal format for getting inspiration. And I think that what we've heard is a lot of merchants are really excited about having a richer platform to tell their stories. So on the organic side, we continue to see, really strong growth in just video views. And then we're also seeing a really strong growth in the number of videos uploaded to Pinterest, we had seven experts and videos uploaded year-on-year. And how does that apply to advertisers? Well, we've made some investments to really improve the video advertising experience for advertisers. For example, in the last quarter, we introduced a carousel format, you can now have a video cover on that on that carousel. And we see that video is taking up a larger portion of our revenue over time, just again, because it's a great format. And it applies not only to brand, but there's also different performance based objectives that can be served with video. A great example of this was [Indiscernible] kind of personal favorite of mine, because I like ice cream. And they wanted to introduce people to kind of new product lines. And they ran a video ad campaign as well as standard ads. And they just saw really great results 3% lift in sales, and two extra on adspend as measured by Nielsen Catalina. So the second part of your question was really about stories. And you correctly point out this is really early, but we're excited about it, that we begin to be able to innovate on video format. So some some stories that I've been excited about, we see people teaching folks how to how to cook recipes. And we launched a campaign called, \u201cChefs at Home\u201d, where we have a lot of restaurant tours, and Chefs cooking recipes at their house and teaching people how to do it. We've seen people create videos for fitness story pins, showing people how to do exercise routines. We see things like DIY, there were a lot of videos on how to make your own mask. And we're starting to also bring on more talent that's more familiar with how to produce great video content. So we hired one of our first hires in the company that came from the media publishing, [Indiscernible] we've also added some expertise on to our board. In the last quarter, we mentioned the addition of Andre Wishom, who worked with Oprah, more recently on the Roku Salam who came from Disney, but also was the president of style. So overall, we think we're really early there. We think the opportunity to use video to deliver inspiration is a big one. And we're eager to learn what people find most inspiring and most useful on the platform.\nRich Greenfield: Thanks a lot for taking the question. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. You've mentioned a couple of times, including in the letter, the return on adspend that your advertisers are seeing. I was wondering if you could dig into that just a little bit deeper for us. I'm sure you've got other anecdotes are either quantitative or qualitative, that you might be willing to share just on what you're seeing in the return on adspend that, that advertisers are recognizing, especially as it's trended over time through the pandemic, because you've got more advertisers on the platform, and presumably driving up prices to a degree. But also, as you've innovated on the technology side to improve targeting and measurement ways that, that's likely improving that, that return on adspend, as well. So any insight into the trends that you're seeing there would be helpful?\nBen Silbermann: I can start here, and Todd kind of may add more color. I mean in general we've seen advertisers see great returns across a variety of different objectives. We've given some examples about brand objectives. But we've also seen great results from people pursuing traffic or conversion objectives. As he pointed out, some of that has been driven by improvements in our ability to measure transactions. And we've talked over I guess, the last three quarters about investments we're making to make sure that people can really understand the unique value that Pinterest brings through first party measurements through better conversion tools. And what's especially important for us is that people come to Pinterest, and they often don't specifically know what they're looking for. And so they might have a longer conversion window, before they actually make a purchase. And so we really focused on helping people tell that story from the moment of inspiration to the ultimate purchase. That was -- those really benefit those and then the other big benefit is come as we talked about before from automation, making it less on the advertiser themselves to actually customize all the different parameters. They set that objective, and then we figure out the best way to utilize that budget. And we've seen just great returns on both of those fronts. Todd, anything to add there?\nTodd Morgenfeld: No, I thought that was, that was great. Thank you.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jane Penner.\nJane Penner: Thanks so much, everyone. I'm actually going to turn the call back over to Ben so he can close it out.\nBen Silbermann: Well, thanks everyone for joining the call and for your interesting questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going. And please enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I want to give some brief color on the trends that we saw during the third quarter as well as to provide an informal outlook for both revenue and costs going into Q4. I'll begin with a quick summary of the headlines and then we can go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we grew overall revenue 58% year-over-year, we also generated a positive 21% adjusted EBITDA margin. Monthly active user growth remained strong with all major regions once again growing in the double digits. We did experience a modest monthly active user uplift at the end of the quarter related to iOS 14 updates. Younger users in particular turned to Pinterest to find inspiration for customized backgrounds. We estimate this single use case drove an incremental 4 million monthly active users globally. Looking ahead, we expect these 4 million MAUs are more likely to churn in Q4 given the digital wallpaper is a relatively transient use case. Additionally, we expect our business to maintain its momentum in Q4, with revenue growing around 60% year-over-year. We saw much more demand for advertising services than we expected in Q3. There were three primary drivers of this strength. First, the investments we've made over the past year in technology, and then sales coverage are continuing to pay off. And the returns exceeded our expectations in Q3. Over the past year, we've invested in conversion optimization or OCPM ads, shopping, ads, and auto bidding to help diversify our advertiser base, and we also expanded our sales team in Western Europe to monetize their engagement there. These investments continue to pay off. Specifically, auto bid was a meaningful contributor to the strength in Q3, especially for small and medium sized businesses. And their international business grew 145% year-over-year now representing 16% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Given the enormous opportunity ahead of us, we'll continue to invest opportunistically to best serve pinners, merchants and advertisers. The returns from these investments may not always be linear, but we do believe we have a strong roadmap ahead in 2021 and beyond. Second, beyond our own investments, the macro environment is very supportive in Q3. Advertising demand improved overall, and we saw both brand advertisers and large retailers that have paused spend in Q2 returned to our platform. We also saw continued strength in the conversion oriented small and medium sized advertisers who gravitated to Pinterest in Q2 because of the native, commercial intent of our users, and because of the on-going secular shift toward e-commerce that has been accelerated by the COVID crisis. Our sales team was able to lean into these favorable conditions in Q3 helping to introduce advertisers to new tools and features, and operating with high efficiency overall. Our go-to-market effectiveness has also been bolstered by the unique insights that we're able to provide to advertisers. Advertisers increasingly depend on these insights to understand the leading indicators of consumer demand in this environment, which earns us both mindshare, and outspend. Third, we continue to benefit from marketers who are prioritizing positivity and brand safety. Advertisers tell us that Pinterest is brand safe relative to other consumer internet platforms. And we've benefited from this in Q3. Though, it's still not clear how sustainable this trend will be, particularly after the U.S. election is over. Turning to our informal outlook for Q4, I want to provide some color here as well. We expect that our momentum will continue in Q4 as many of the Q3 drivers persist into the holiday season. These include the positive trends driven by our investments in conversion and shopping ads, automation and international sales coverage. There are also two external unknowns that could impact our business. First, the impact of the COVID situation remains hard to predict both on user engagement patterns, as well as on advertiser demand. In addition to on-going uncertainty related to continued disease spread and lockdowns across the globe, our visibility into Q4 is further limited by uncertainty about the impact COVID will have on seasonal engagement and ad spend. Pinners may likely plan for the holidays differently, and it's hard to know how marketers will respond to these changes. The second unknown is the tailwind we've experienced from the advertiser boycott of social media that began in July. On one hand, this group of advertisers accelerated their spend on Pinterest in Q3. On the other hand, the attractiveness of a positive brand safe consumer platform may wane somewhat after the U.S. election cycle is over in November, so some of that spend may wane too. To be clear, we think the positivity of Pinterest is a long term competitive advantage for many reasons. But it's just difficult to predict near term advertiser behavior, particularly in an election season. Finally, our current understanding of how both of these unknowns will play out is limited given the Q4 advertiser demand is typically back end loaded in the quarter. Finally, before opening it up for questions, I want to touch briefly on expenses. We continue to navigate a more remote working environment while maintaining investments in the long term strategic priorities of the company. We took the steps to end a future lease obligation for the company during the quarter. To put a finer point on this, we believe a more distributed workforce will give us the opportunity to hire people from a wider range of backgrounds and experiences. In Q3, we grew headcount 19% year-over-year at a similar pace to last quarter. As we look to Q4, we expect to modestly grow total non-GAAP operating expenses compared to the third quarter. We will continue to invest in our key strategic priorities, including content, engagement, advertising, diversification, and shopping. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it, open it up for questions. So Mark, I think from the financial impact perspective, what we're trying to do right now in shopping is improve the inventory of shoppable products on Pinterest, and then improve the discoverability of those products over time to the investments we've been making. We've talked over the last couple calls about things like our success and ingesting more catalogs to get shoppable content onto the service. We've talked about partnerships that accelerate that work. And then we've talked about high intent shopping surfaces that we've been building and designing to make it easier for Pinners to find not only inspiration, but actually bring those items into their life. That's been the primary focus is the consumer experience. And what we've talked about over the last couple quarters is consistent with the way that we're thinking about it today. We'll eventually monetize that over time, but we're majoring in the consumer experience today and monitoring and leveraged revenue. Shopping oriented revenue is growing quicker than the overall business, but it's just a small contributor to the overall mix. I would expect that to be a driver over a longer period of time. Lloyd, on the second part of your question on capacity, I think Ben hit on the most important point, which is around the high intent that we see on the platform and increasingly seeing search and related things activity, it's being an opportunity for us to bring more medium sized advertisers, more advertisers overall, but specifically, small and medium sized advertisers on the platform to continue to deliver relevant advertising against those interests. But to be even more kind of tactical about your, your question, what we're seeing right now is definitely more efficient spend through on existing budgets. So we're taking the manual nature out of campaign management and automating it to better returns for advertising partners, and better clearing existing budgets. And we're seeing early returns on those budgets increasing, but I would say it's too early to have a specific and clear answer to your question about where the limits would be on that. Yes, I mean, Ross, it's really hard to parse. I mean, I would love to be able to disaggregate that and say, we're getting X amounts from the technology investments we've made. We're getting Y amounts on demand returning from a macro perspective, or insights give us a certain amount and the brand safety equates to the remainder, in reality it's the combination of all the above. Ads are working. I think we went through this a little bit on Brian's question, but making it easier for especially medium sized advertisers to on-board and automate spending their budgets effectively against their desired online conversion and sales objectives has been a big driver for us. It's been driving our advertiser count up, and it's been a significant component of our growth story. We've seen a major impact just around brands CPG, advertisers and brand advertisers returning to the platform after a pause in Q2 and the return of retail, especially the larger omni channel retailers that have paused in Q2. We're seeing a lot of interest in the insights that we're bringing to advertisers. The notion that our commercial intensive our users translates into a leading indicator of where demand is going to go is really resonating. We're seeing that without advertisers like Hershey around Halloween at home, is as a trend. I think Ben may have mentioned that before. We had great conversations with Miracle-Gro around home gardening trends that enabled them to deliver much more effective advertising campaigns, powered by the insights that we delivered. Welch's is another example around summer celebrations and back-to-school where we were able to help them with their campaign management and creative to deliver a much more performance advertising campaign. So those insights are really differentiating and are causing a lot of traction with advertisers. And then finally, this brand safety concept, especially post July and the boycotts that we saw, I would imagine that we're seeing a sustained benefit just due to the election season. But I think it's a secular trend where advertisers want to be around positivity as they build their brands, and that that's contributing to our growth as well. That's what we're hearing. So it's a mix of product and technology, macro recovery, the insights that we're able to deliver, and the brand safety and positivity that Pinterest uniquely brings and the world of social media. Thanks, Eric, I can take the first part. And then Ben can probably speak to the second. On international, I would say we have started investing more aggressively about a year and a half ago, to staff out offices in Western Europe and get direct coverage on the ground, beef up our teams and in English speaking countries outside of the U.S. And those efforts scaled in terms of the investments over the course of last year and then too early, the early part of this year. And I would say we're seeing those results. 125% growth in revenue in international markets is being driven really by a handful of English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and Western Europe, or from the world from 10% of revenue in the year ago, quarter to 16% of revenue now from international on this quarter. And the momentum we're seeing there has been remarkable. We're still staffing those, we're still hiring to staff those offices out as we believe those markets have presented a lot more upside even from where we are today. And so I feel very good about what we're doing from an execution standpoint. The teams are doing a terrific job building relationships with advertisers and delivering great results. And so that's been remarkable. And I you know, I see a lot of other opportunity for us beyond those markets. As we move forward, we're hoping to begin monetizing in the next region, Latin America in the first half of next year. And I think there's a lot more that we can be doing across our existing monetized markets outside of the U.S. and into new regions as the next few years unfold. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the question. So on the first point on brands, versus performance advertising. We've long been majority performance oriented meaning traffic conversion optimization and shopping versus awareness advertising. We mixed a little bit more toward performance in the quarter. But in general, this is across the board strength, across our brands or awareness objectives all the way through performance. And I think that highlights one of the unique aspects of the platform that we often hear from advertisers is there's value in the full funnel experience going from inspiration and finding a new idea all the way through a transaction is something that's a powerful mix. And I think we're seeing the results of that. To your point on the shopping experiences, it's just really hard to, to know in this tough environment, how things will play out. And our Q4 has typically been pretty back end loaded in the month of November and December. We're definitely seeing shopping happening a little earlier probably than last year. But, it just remains to be seen how the rest of the quarter plays out and how the seasonal moments and they adapt. And if you think back to last quarter, we talked about back-to-school being a risk in Q3 and we ended up seeing a fair amount of back-to-school spend. It just happened in slightly different verticals and at different times, and a little bit more dynamically than what we had typically seen. So even in Q4 right now, the planning cycles, the dynamism around spend, and the flexibility and nimble nature that advertisers are bringing into this season is a little bit unprecedented for us. Thanks, Doug. So on the \u2013 I'll take both of those. On the admin [ph] point. We saw a mix of contribution from impressions and price globally in the quarter. So it was much more balanced in terms of the impact of price and volume on revenue performance. That's one way of thinking about your question. I think overall, the message is still consistent with what we started with when we went public, which is, this is a platform where ads if they're delivered to the right person at the right time can feel like content. And we're more constrained by relevance and advertising, then messaging or social media where ads are attacks on the experience. So for us, it's mostly about how do we how do we deliver relevant advertising content that speaks to the interests and the commercial intent of our users. One of the benefits of having high intent shopping service surfaces as an example is that we're better equipped to serve a higher density of advertising. If you're -- if you're on Pinterest to find home decor items, you probably welcome advertisements that are from a retailer that you trust with an aesthetic that matches your tastes, etcetera. So, I think we're, we're a little bit further along in the U.S. than we are globally, there's a ton of room globally on ad mode, we're probably a little closer to our guardrails in the U.S. than we are on a global basis. But there's a lot of upside, if we can continue to get more advertisers on the platform, continue to deliver high intent shopping surfaces, and through our technology, make sure we're serving the right ad to the right person at the right time. On expenses. When I thought about long term margins, we were thinking about them on an annualized basis. And you can imagine, in a seasonal business like ours, where Q1 revenue is quite, a small contribution relative to the annual amount and Q4 is much larger. As we go into Q4 that will typically be the highest margin quarter for the company over the course of the year. You're right that in a world where we grow our expenses, modestly, that margins would expand in Q4. And it's probably worth calling out to that even in the year ago quarter, we did some brand marketing tests to the tune of nearly $10 million of spend that we won't be doing this year. There's a lot of those sorts of investments that in this current environment we will revisit going into next year when we think they can be effective again. But things like travel, events, marketing spend over the last few months have just been expenses we haven't had to deal with in this environment. And we're looking for ways to continue to invest going in the next year that would be an items that we had deferred through this COVID period and marketing in particular was one of those. So yes, the margins can be higher, but on an annualized basis, we'll still be below our long term targets. I can take the first part of the question, Justin. We did see kind of engagement across a number of our core verticals, food, home beauty, style. Predictively, there were some use cases that were less popular than they have been in the past. Things like people planning for big outdoor events, although, interestingly, we've started to see some uptick in that, as people might be looking forward to the future. So as I mentioned a couple times before, we're monitoring closely, the sustainability of engagement and how particularly that cohort of users who joined during the COVID period of engagements with the service, but we don't see a massive category shifts from that cohort in particular. No, I thought that was, that was great. Thank you."

            "name": "Ben Silbermann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane. Hi, everyone. We appreciate you joining today. By now, many of you seen our shareholder letter. So just to offer brief comments that the quarter, Todd's going follow up with some additional details, and then we'll open it up to questions as soon as we can. I'll start by saying that we're happy with our performance this quarter. Q3 started with a lot of unknowns, because of COVID-19. But we were able to focus on what we could control. And that's executing our strategic priorities that we set at the beginning of the year, bringing on the most inspirational content, making Pinterest more engaging and useful, serving and diversifying our advertiser base, and finally making Pinterest more shoppable. All this led to strong results. Monthly active users grew 37% year-over-year to $442 million, and revenue grew over 58% year-on-year. We're seeing a number of our investments paying off, like growing our international presence in places like Western Europe, in our progress with automation to make it easier for small and medium sized advertisers, and finally making Pinterest more shoppable. We also launched a number of new products, like tools to help traders reach new audiences and bring even more inspirational content onto Pinterest. And more recently, a new suite of merchant tools to help retailers reach more customers this holiday season and beyond. Overall, we accomplished a lot. Now obviously, there's still a lot of unknowns in the future because of COVID-19. But I'm confident about our team's ability to innovate in the midst of all this change. And I want to give a quick thank you to the entire Pinterest team for their hard work in an unpredictable year. Apparently the resilience, the team demonstrated and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd who will give more color about our business performance. Todd? Sure. There are a number of things that worked in the quarter. And I think we touched on a number of them in the opening comments, but I'll pause on the first one, which is that ads are working on Pinterest, right now and advertisers are, are telling us that ads are working. And it's in large part due to the investments we've made in technology that make it easier for advertisers to hit their goals on the platform. And so there are really two areas where we're seeing that. The first is around conversion activity. And especially in this environment, what we're hearing is that returns accountable performance formats to drive measurable conversions and online sales, particularly in the mid-market segment, are a sweet spot for us. We've been making those investments, we've talked about the work we've done on tag integration partnerships on making sure the tags are working, what we call tag health, building tools to deliver better insights, things like our Pinterest conversion analysis tool and our conversion insights tool. That work has been incredibly impactful. And we're seeing the results in the growth of our SMB segment, which really drove the ball, a significant part of our growth during the quarter. The second thing, and you touched on this is the vision for automation. You can imagine a world and this will take us a long time to deliver in reality. But the vision is that an advertiser brings us their budget, their goals and their content, and we automate the rest. We started chipping away at this over the course of the last couple quarters with our investments in autobid. It started with traffic objectives, several months ago, and over around 80% of our CPC, or traffic objectives are now running through automatic -- auto bid. We launched auto bid for conversion optimization in July. And we're now at 50 plus percent of revenue through auto bid on that format. And we launched the shopping, as you mentioned, in September and the uptake, there has been quick as well. So I think we've got a great road map ahead. I -- as I mentioned in the opening remarks, I don't know that the returns will be linear on those things. But the vision around making it easier for advertisers to on board and not do as much manual management of their campaigns is something that we think will drive long term returns for us. Sure, Lloyd. I can take the first part of your question. What I heard was, how durables we think that the cohort of users that have come on during COVID is what do we know about how they engage with the platform so far? What we know right now is that the people that used the joint Pinterest during this COVID period, and they do tend to engage at higher level across a basket of metrics, and then folks that joined at the same time last year, but there are a few things that we've learned that are kind of worth sharing. First we have seen that engagement tends to increase when lockdown order are in effect and decrease when orders are lifted. And so while we believe that they'll net out in the positive place, we think that there's some effect from people spending more time at home. And the things they're doing at home are often things they've done for years, but in a new way. We talked in the last earnings call about setting up a home office or home school. That even applies to things like seasonal events, where parents are trying to reimagine Halloween, or think about what is what are the holidays look like when, instead of having a lot of families over, it might just be your family for Thanksgiving or Christmas. The second thing that we've observed is that these users often come for a specific purpose. And therefore, use features like search more than more browser features like the home feed. And we think that that offers an opportunity, because search is obviously a high intent service, but it also raises the bar on the relevance of ads that we have to provide. That's why our long term strategy is around relevance. And one of the drivers of that relevance is increasing the number of advertisers that we can serve by making it easy for managed small and mid-sized businesses to work with interest. So I don't know that we have quantitative answer to your question, knowing exactly where engagement will net out, we assume there might be some erosion. But we do think that a lot of the early trends are positive, and we still see upside. And Eric, to answer your second question. It hasn't shown it's opening remarks that we saw a particular surge of young users following the iOS 14 release, as a lot of young people look to customize their phones. But that trend of users under the age of 25 joining and growing at a faster rate than users over the age of 25 is something we've seen for a couple quarters continuously. When we talk to these users, what they tell us is they're excited to have a place where they can get inspiration. They feel well served with wonderful tools they can use to keep in touch with their friends and follow celebrities. But Pinterest offers them something different, which is a chance to get inspiration on everything from what they wear to hobbies that they might have to future plans. Your question was what we're doing for these users in particular? We're doing a few things. First, the top priority for the company has been to make sure Pinterest is the hub for inspiring content. In previous calls, we talked about a really significant increase in video and young users really expect video is the primary way they get inspiration and we've seen a really fantastic growth in viewership of both organic and paid video. This quarter, we introduced new tools for people to publish videos stories and to capitalize on that trend. And then we also have some experiments that are in place. This week, we launched an iOS widget, which lets people take that inspiration, whether it's inspiring quote or inspiring styles and put it directly onto their phone. And we'll continue to try things to see how we can make the integration as useful and relevant, accessible to the Chinese as possible. So we do think that we pay close attention to that under 25 cohort, we don't see significant divergence of behavior, but they are they tend to be trendsetters. And so we monitor them closely and see what we can learn. Sure, Mike I can, I can start and Todd can feel free to -- feel free to add on more. So, we've outlined for several quarters in a row that our shopping strategy really has two major goals. One is improving our inventory of reliable products. And so as you mentioned on improvements that we've made to retail its ability to upload their catalog, those do indeed have a really, really big impact. This quarter, we've released UI improvements to make it simpler, and we've increased the speed of uploading. We've also introduced things like scheduling, and all of those things really are about building a base, very, very high quality inventory, some trustworthy retailers with accurate pricing information. And Shopify has been part of that story. Shopify is home to some of the most inspirational retailers. And so we're really excited to be able to partner with them and really remove the friction from retailers that want to upload their catalogue to the audience on Pinterest that are really looking for inspiration. And do it with just one tap. So that's kind of that first part about inventory. And then the second part of the strategy is taking an inventory, how do we improve the discoverability of those products? And on Pinterest, we have a little bit of a different approach than what some people might call spearfishing. People on Pinterest start with something they want to achieve a scene of a living room, a scene of a look. And then they work backwards into the products. And we've been building dedicated shopping surfaces. So you can take that inspirational image, and then see that great catalog and inspiring inventory, some of which might come from Shopify or any of the other versions that we're working on. And that's been something that's been going really well, although we still have a long way to go. Over the last six months, the number of Pinners that are engaging with their shopping surfaces; it's grown more than 85%. So really, really significantly. And we're really working to balance and make sure that we start with inspiration. And then when you're ready to go ahead and make that purchase, you can do it really easily. The last thing I'd add is that we think that that trend ultimately will be global. And we just took our very first step internationalizing that in Q3 when we launched shopping in the U.K. Thanks for the question, Mark. So I think there are two ways of looking at that question. The first is our new users engaging and using some of the new features we're launching. And the answer in general is a lot of the features we're building are things that our users have been asking us for, for years and years. So the number one user request for years is I see something, it looks great. I'm all ready to buy it, and then I can't find it and that's what's really driving our investments in shopping. Similarly, as the web has become more visual and more video based people have wanted a richer and more immersive way to experience those. And so while things like storage bins are very new, we're optimistic given the success we've seen. I did mention earlier that one thing we're observing is that some of our newer users use Pinterest more for search based. So it's still inspiration and visual discovery, but they're actually searching for specific things. And so if there was a difference, I would say, particularly the COVID cohort, in the more recent cohorts have been engaged more deeply in search. And so we're always looking to think, how do we take the areas that users are engaging with a lot and amplify them, but also share with them and parts of this service, they may not yet have had a chance to experience. Thanks. And I know we skipped over the second part of Justin's question. But I think that was very similar to the one you, you just asked about the back end loaded nature of the quarter and momentum that we're seeing. And the reality is we're \u2013 and I think I can answer both of those. And then we can talk about shopping days. In general, we're seeing a lot of the same drivers in Q4 that we saw in Q3. As I mentioned before, the ads are working, our investments in technology and product are working around conversions and automation. We are seeing kind of the return of retail and continue to strengthen CPG advertisers. We're seeing a lot of appetite for the insights that we're delivering, which is sustained through Q3 into Q4, this brand safety narrative has continued to be you know, we talked about it on the last earnings call, we didn't really know if it was going to be a July phenomenon only or if it was going to persist. And if it persisted, would it persist past the election? It's persisted. And it seems to be something that's important to advertisers. But we'll see post-election how it plays out. And then the international strength that we've been seeing has been a source of upsides when we've talked about for a long time and then been investing in but it's played out nicely. So I'd say, we're seeing a lot of the same drivers that we saw through Q3 play out into Q4 and hopefully we'll, despite this weird environment that we're in, hopefully we'll see it play out. But those risks around how COVID impacts seasonal moments, how shopping behavior changes, how people celebrate those moments, how advertisers respond to them. Whether advertising around the an election that may be quite a quite a new cycle here in the next few weeks. How that plays out. Those are those are just uncertainties for us right now. On the shopping days point. We talked about that last year being a headwind and it didn't really play out that way. So I'm hesitant to call it in the other direction this year is upside. And so we'll see how it plays out. I do think we've seen shopping behavior start a little earlier this year. And I would expect that given that that maybe it doesn't matter how many, how many days are in the official shopping period between Black Friday and the end of the year. Rich, can you restore [ph] on that second part of the question. I missed the second part of the question. Yes, I can I can start. So, yes, if we think that video is an ideal format for getting inspiration. And I think that what we've heard is a lot of merchants are really excited about having a richer platform to tell their stories. So on the organic side, we continue to see, really strong growth in just video views. And then we're also seeing a really strong growth in the number of videos uploaded to Pinterest, we had seven experts and videos uploaded year-on-year. And how does that apply to advertisers? Well, we've made some investments to really improve the video advertising experience for advertisers. For example, in the last quarter, we introduced a carousel format, you can now have a video cover on that on that carousel. And we see that video is taking up a larger portion of our revenue over time, just again, because it's a great format. And it applies not only to brand, but there's also different performance based objectives that can be served with video. A great example of this was [Indiscernible] kind of personal favorite of mine, because I like ice cream. And they wanted to introduce people to kind of new product lines. And they ran a video ad campaign as well as standard ads. And they just saw really great results 3% lift in sales, and two extra on adspend as measured by Nielsen Catalina. So the second part of your question was really about stories. And you correctly point out this is really early, but we're excited about it, that we begin to be able to innovate on video format. So some some stories that I've been excited about, we see people teaching folks how to how to cook recipes. And we launched a campaign called, \u201cChefs at Home\u201d, where we have a lot of restaurant tours, and Chefs cooking recipes at their house and teaching people how to do it. We've seen people create videos for fitness story pins, showing people how to do exercise routines. We see things like DIY, there were a lot of videos on how to make your own mask. And we're starting to also bring on more talent that's more familiar with how to produce great video content. So we hired one of our first hires in the company that came from the media publishing, [Indiscernible] we've also added some expertise on to our board. In the last quarter, we mentioned the addition of Andre Wishom, who worked with Oprah, more recently on the Roku Salam who came from Disney, but also was the president of style. So overall, we think we're really early there. We think the opportunity to use video to deliver inspiration is a big one. And we're eager to learn what people find most inspiring and most useful on the platform. I can start here, and Todd kind of may add more color. I mean in general we've seen advertisers see great returns across a variety of different objectives. We've given some examples about brand objectives. But we've also seen great results from people pursuing traffic or conversion objectives. As he pointed out, some of that has been driven by improvements in our ability to measure transactions. And we've talked over I guess, the last three quarters about investments we're making to make sure that people can really understand the unique value that Pinterest brings through first party measurements through better conversion tools. And what's especially important for us is that people come to Pinterest, and they often don't specifically know what they're looking for. And so they might have a longer conversion window, before they actually make a purchase. And so we really focused on helping people tell that story from the moment of inspiration to the ultimate purchase. That was -- those really benefit those and then the other big benefit is come as we talked about before from automation, making it less on the advertiser themselves to actually customize all the different parameters. They set that objective, and then we figure out the best way to utilize that budget. And we've seen just great returns on both of those fronts. Todd, anything to add there? Well, thanks everyone for joining the call and for your interesting questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going. And please enjoy the rest of your day."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJane Penner: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest\u2019s earnings conference call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, our President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations. Now, I\u2019ll cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q3, 2020 are preliminary and may not be an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Hi, everyone. Thanks a lot for joining the call this morning. Todd and I will be giving some brief opening remarks, touching on our results and our four strategic priorities, which are making Pinterest home to the most inspiring content, helping Pinners discover more use cases, making Pinterest more shoppable and scaling our ad business, then we'll be happy to take your questions. But before going into business results as we usually do, I just want to acknowledge that this period feels like anything, but business as usual for people and businesses here in the U.S. and across the world. First, there's COVID-19, which in addition to being a global health threat is impacting how people live and work, including all of us here at Pinterest. We're learning how to operate as a distributed workforce, and in this new climate, we're going to keep making collaboration and efficiency a priority, so we can keep delivering for Pinners and for our advertisers. In addition, here in the U.S., we're experiencing historic moment for racial justice, one that's leading companies to look at what they can do better, and Pinterest is no exception. We've made a number of commitments to drive change from improving representation in our product to increasing the diversity of our workforce, especially in senior roles. I know that this is not how most earning calls begin, but I want to be transparent with all of you and with the public that we're not just focused on what we're doing as a business, but also how we do business. These issues are top of mind with everything we do, and we're going to work hard to do right by all of our stakeholders. Now on to our business results. Pinterest had a strong Q2, in both the U.S. and international markets. More people came to Pinterest looking for inspiration than ever before. We ended the quarter with 416 million monthly active users, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. In particular, we saw strong growth from resurrected users, as well as from users under the age of 25, who grew twice as fast as users over 25. These users came looking for ideas as they adjusted to life during a global pandemic, and with new tools like the today tab, we help connect them to new use cases, everything from home office setups to recipes to cook at home to different summer activities for kids. We also continue to make our content more inspirational, and one example of this is video, which offers pinners another dynamic and engaging way to discover ideas. During Q2, total daily video views, which include both organic and paid, grew over 150% year-over-year, and we're looking to do more in the space. In addition, we also connected Pinterest to more shoppable content, so they can turn their plans into a reality. We saw catalog uploads from businesses increased by more than 350% from Q1 to Q2. And we built new features like our Shop tab and the ability to shop from boards to make it easier for Pinners to find this content. So in total, we're making a lot of progress in helping pinners find inspiration for their lives. This is work that, in my mind, because of everything happening in the world, is as meaningful and relevant as it has been in the last decade. And here to share more about what all this is meant for advertisers in our overall business is our CFO, Todd.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I want to give some brief color on the trends we've seen to-date in revenue, as well as to provide an informal outlook for both revenue and costs in Q3. I'll begin with a summary of the headlines and then we can go into more detail. Starting with Q2 revenue, we saw advertiser demand improve each month of the quarter. April was the weakest month in the immediate aftermath of sheltering in place. May growth rates improved and June showed further improvement. In July, we've seen a sharp acceleration in revenue to about 50% year-over-year growth, through July 29. We expect that revenue will grow in the mid-30s percent range year-over-year in Q3, this growth rate assumes a deceleration from the strong growth we've seen so far in July. I'll say more about this shortly. First to unpack what we've seen to-date and what we currently know to be driving our results, then I'll discuss our outlook and the significant uncertainties that we're facing. Q2 is characterized by initial softness in advertising demand and then a partial return of that demand. The formula was triggered by COVID-19-related lockdowns and the latter by the return of economic activity as those lockdowns eased. We saw ad demand recover across many verticals starting in May, with CPG showing particular momentum in the latter part of June and into July. The retail vertical lagged CPG, but has recently begun to recover as well. This was the pattern in both the U.S. and in international markets, but non-U.S. markets recovered a bit faster. On top of the macro driven recovery and advertising demand, we're seeing a lot of demand for Pinterest ad products in particular. Here's what our advertisers are telling us. First, our ads are working, especially for marketers seeking sales and conversions. The investments we've made in conversion optimization or OCPM shopping ads and auto bids are making it easier for these advertisers to hit their goals. In a world where their balance sheets are at risk, marketers want ROI accountable ads and we are delivering them. This has bolstered our ability to attract performance oriented medium-sized advertisers, a group that emerged as a key driver of our resilience in Q2. Second, the commercial mindset of our users is very attractive right now, because many advertisers want to drive online sales and Pinterest tend to be in market consumers. The early commercial intent on our platform also informs the insights we share with advertisers. And they are increasingly using these insights to understand leading indicators of demand in this unprecedented environment. In the words of the Head of U.S. Media at Ford, \"I received a report that was incredibly interesting from Pinterest. They showed how people's behavior on the platform is changing from the types of behaviors you'd expect during shelter-in-place, recipes, crafts with kids, baking bread, deploying oriented behaviors, for example, thinking about vacations. Sure, we can always look at the quant data, leading indicators, traffic reports, et cetera. But to get at something that unlocks what people are actually thinking about, even if they're not saying it is really important. That's where the relationships really come to life between marketers and the platforms.\" Finally, advertisers feel Pinterest is brand space relative to other platforms. In a moment where there is a lot of hostile political conversation happening on social media, advertisers are looking for new places to put their dollars. We benefited from this in July. As I noted earlier, we expect that revenue will grow in the mid-30s percent range year-over-year in Q3, which implies a deceleration from the roughly 50% year-over-year growth rate we've seen quarter to-date through July. Let me unpack this. One month may not be representative of the full quarter and there's significant uncertainty for the following reasons. First, cases of COVID-19 arising and any new lockdowns would likely have a negative impact on advertiser demand. Second, our main seasonal moment in Q3 back-to-school will likely look very different this year, as schools across the U.S. embrace distance learning. This could lower both engagement and advertiser demand. Third, it's not clear, if or how long the tailwind we've experienced in July from advertisers boycotting social media will last. Finally, revenue growth in August and September 2019 was stronger relative to July 2019, when a product change briefly lowered our conversion optimization revenue. So year-over-year comparisons will be harder for remainder of the quarter. I also want to address our costs before opening it up for Q&A. On our Q1 call, I said we expected to grow operating expenses year-over-year in the second quarter, but we just reported a slight decline in this number. This was the result of implementing cost savings measures more quickly and our work from home model to a larger extent than we originally expected. We continue to invest for growth across our key strategic priorities of content, ads diversification, use case expansion and shopping. To that end, we grew headcount 21% year-over-year and 5% sequentially during the second quarter. We expect to grow OpEx in Q3 both sequentially and year-over-year to pursue the long term vision of the company, while continuing to monitor and to respond to the ever changing environment. I hope this detail has been informative and helpful. With that, I can turn it back to the operator and we can begin to take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I can. First just drilling into the higher engagement, in the shareholder letter you said new users are engaging more this year than last year. Wondering how are new users specifically engaging differently maybe with the shopping functionality? And then, for that matter how our existing users are engaging with the shopping functionality? And then, just second one. As you look at more CPC advertisers running through automatic bidding and seeing improving ROIs, are you seeing them increase budgets? Any sense for what percent of your advertisers spend is on an open budget basis these days? Thanks a lot.\nBen Silbermann: This is Ben, thanks for the question. Why don\u2019t I tackle your first question about user engagement, and then I'll turn it over to Todd around kind of all those on budgets. So, the question was how are new users engaging differently? And in particular, how are they engaging with some of the shopping surfaces? So, we find that the use cases that people are coming to Pinterest for are broadly similar, in that people are looking for ways of establishing new habits, especially in the time of change. So, many of our core use cases around making the home more livable, personal well-being and fitness does continue to be themes. Although, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, and we're seeing particular strengths in the growth of folks that are under the age of 25. The second part of the question was, how are these users engaging with some of the new shopping features. And we're seeing good engagement, although it still remains early. We've shipped shopping only surfaces and engagement with those surfaces up to 50% in the first-half of 2020. And we're also seeing more product only searches, which have grown by 8x in 2020. As you know, from previous calls our strategy in shopping is to make these surfaces, but to also make sure that they're filled with highly relevant products. And the two things we're doing to drive that are increase the number of merchants who have uploaded their catalog, and we saw a sharp increase in the number of catalog feeds uploaded, up 360% sequentially. And then to use machine learning and computer vision technology to make sure that we're matching the right products to inspiring themes. I hope that gives some color on shopping engagement and initial engagement [ph]. Todd?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. And on the second part of your question on automatic bidding, we start with why auto bid matters. Before automatic bidding, advertisers had to constantly manage their bid strategy in a dynamic auction. Now the auto bid tool does this for them and it aims to get advertisers the most clicks at the lowest possible Cost per Click or CPC or topic objectives, while spending their entire budget. We made a lot of progress on that during Q2. The last time we talked about 50% of our traffic objectives were flowing through auto bid. And now about 80% of CPC revenue is going through auto bid. And so budget utilizations have remained high for auto bid traffic objectives. And basically, we're better able to clear existing budgets and deliver more efficient cost per click, and generally higher click through rates. So, in other words, the advertisers are seeing a better return on their spend through auto bid, and we're taking the friction out of the process through better tooling. What I would say is, and one example of that is ARM & HAMMER baking soda, where for Do-It-Yourself, home science project campaign for kids. They were driving 77% more efficient cost per clicks on 23% higher click through rates. And so that's a specific example of how this can work for an advertiser. In general, what that's meant is we're better able to deliver against the budgets that are in the system today. And as advertisers are seeing these sorts of good returns and performance, we would expect over time for there to be more budget in the system. It's worth noting, in addition to the traffic objective auto bid that we did launch, as we said, we would a couple months ago, auto bid for our OCPM objective a few weeks ago, and we're seeing very good early traction there too.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, Todd, thanks for all the color on July and 3Q. Can we just talk a little bit like last call, I think you had talked about how some of your biggest retail advertisers, had like a capacity versus demand mismatch and that they were pausing their budgets before that normalized. And so, are some of those folks coming back now that we have these high growth rates in July? And in 3Q, where does that stand? And then, I guess, is it possible to parse based on your conversations that you're having with advertisers? Like how much is actually coming from the boycott issue versus all these great product initiatives that you're doing within the ad-stack? Is it like half from boycott half from Pinterest product initiatives and any color there would be helpful as well, just in terms of framing this recovery that you're seeing? Thanks a lot.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. I know last time, we talked a lot about the macro environment and because we grew the business initially on the back of omni channel, larger omni channel retail and CPG, we had exposure as some of those advertisers pulled back. We talked a lot about how non-essential retailers were suffering from store closures and essential retailers were sold out. And so that was a tough mix for us when they were pulling back for very different reasons. We have seen some recovery, I would say, it started with CPG and we've seen a lot of momentum there. On the retail side, the growth and the return of span has lagged CPG, but it has come back to some extent, as stores have reopened and as essential retailers have figured out their supply chain issues. I've been more encouraged by what I talked about in the opening remarks, about the strategic investments that we've made in our product and in our strategy to diversify our advertiser base into the mid-market, through improved tools, measurement and formats, driving resilience in the quarter and growth. And so I would say, we've seen three things drive the performance, both in Q2 and through July. One is the macro recovery that you talked about that extends across non-essential and essential retail and more notably in CPG. The second is all of the strategic investments we've made in our business and in our product, which is touched or been more exposed to the mid-market segment that we've been talking about for a while, in the spirit of driving ads diversification and more relevant content on the platform through conversion activities. The third thing you noted was around the boycotts. And what I would say about the boycotts, it's been a tailwind, but we do believe the majority of our growth in July has been driven by advertising demand, stemming from those strategic investments in the ad products that we've made over the last year and a half. It's not really clear how sustainable that boycott tailwind is. The boycott has given us an opportunity to win some budgets and to educate advertisers about how and why Pinterest is different. And while other platforms are at the center of political and free speech debates, people come to Pinterest to think optimistically about their futures. And that's especially relevant today, as we provide a respite from what could be one of the most contentious political news cycles in history. Being a service where people envision and plan their lives also creates opportunities, particularly as advertisers seek positive platforms to build their brands and to drive sales. So, we're seeing some evidence of more advertisers choosing Pinterest for this reason in July, it's really hard for us to say how sustainable or significant that trend is. We are tracking spend from advertisers who are participating in the boycott, but we don't know how much of that spent would have come to us anyway, because many of those advertisers do spend on both platforms over time, versus incremental spend due to the boycott. So we can't really quantify the impact precisely at this point.\nRoss Sandler: That's super helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One, big picture. One, if we go back even to the IPO, you guys framed the investments you needed to make to reposition the company against your e-commerce initiatives and capitalizing on the international opportunity. Trying to tease out how far along we are in the investment cycle versus now where you're starting to see some benefit from those investments running through the topline? And what that might mean over the medium and long-term for leverage in the model? And how should we be thinking about that? And then Todd, maybe just one housekeeping just following up on Ross' question. With respect to the commentary in Q3, just because from the outside, and it's hard to conceptualize this. Is there any way to frame what the headwind is in August and September? Because, obviously, the guidance does imply a pretty heavy detail from the trends in July into the back part. Just, I think from the outside, it's tough to understand what that headwind or comp might look like? Thanks so much.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. So on the first, Ben may have some more color on this as well from a strategic perspective. But, I think your questions were more around leverage in the model. And I want to go back as you rightly noted, we talked a lot about how shopping will evolve online. And I think in this environment that's been accelerated. So, I'm very happy that we identified entering the year that we were going to prioritize shopping even more than we had historically, which is oppression. Our investments in e-commerce and shopping most notably have been improving the user experience. So, helping people find new ideas and bring them into their lives by discovering new products. And that's been enabled, as Ben mentioned, by better catalog ingestion and improving the high intense shopping surface experience for users on Pinterest. From a shopping advertising perspective, we noted that a lot of our growth came from conversion optimization and shopping ads, which are closer to online sales and conversion activity in an ROI accountable world. The financial contribution of shopping ads right now is still early days. We're focused mostly on allowing users to find new things and bringing them into their lives and improve that organic shopping experience, knowing that over time we'll start to see more revenue contribution from shopping, as we continue to improve the experience and convince advertisers that early intent on the platform is something that they want to promote against. So, I wouldn't, -- if you're thinking about shopping being a driver in the near-term, I would think of it as more of a contribution next year and beyond. On the international side, we made a lot of investments over the last year plus in building out in particular in Western Europe, more direct coverage and related sales support functions outside of the U.S., but mostly in the English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and Western Europe. We are hiring pretty aggressively in those markets leading into the COVID-19 shut down. And we found that those investments have been paying off nicely. And I think you've seen that in our results, where in the last quarter we grew international revenues 72%, despite all the industry headwinds. We will continue to build that out. I would say that there's still a lot of opportunity even in those markets where we have been making investments and scaling the business. We also have other unmonetized in large growing user bases like in Latin America, that over time we'll also monetize. So, a lot more to come there in terms of leverage in the model. In terms of the decel [ph], we did want to -- I tried to point out in the opening comments that there's just a lot in front of us right now. We don't know what the back-to-school environment will look like. It will be different. We know we've got this headwind that I called out from a much weaker July a year ago than we had this year. And there's a lot of uncertainty around COVID as we go into the fall. So, my expectation is that we will see some moderation in that growth. And frankly, as Ross pointed out around the boycott, we don't really know how much is there and how sustainable the spend that we are getting from the boycott might be. And so we try to capture all that in the mid-30s guidance.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Levine with Pivotal. Please go ahead.\nMichael Levine: Congrats on the results, guys. Love to hear a little bit more, I know you're talking about the traction you were seeing on the shopping feed front. I mean, how much is this Shopify versus how much is this actually, you guys just getting to the right point to better facilitate the product catalog upload? And is there any reason not to think as we look into the seasonally stronger part of the year, I mean, shouldn't this show even further acceleration into Q4?\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Michael. I can start off. So the question was how much of the progress that we're seeing on shopping is being driven by partnerships like the one we have with Shopify, and then how do we expect it to kind of move forward in the future? So, Shopify, we're very happy and very early on in that partnership. For those who haven't read this previously, that partnership allows a Shopify merchant with one click to set up a presence on Pinterest to upload their catalog. I would say that it's still early days and it's one of several partnerships that are important to us. And if you just take a step back, Pinterest's long-term vision for shopping is to really build a full funnel experience. So, we want to take people from the moment of inspiration when they first get an idea, and then play them all the way through so they can identify products that can make that inspiration a reality and eventually purchased. And that's going to be a long-term road. We're very focused right now I mean at the top in the middle of the funnel. So, we're improving the amount of inventory we have and we're building surfaces that keep Pinterest an inspiring place. But when the time is right, push people to identify the products they really want to buy. And that's the value proposition we want, both for retailers who really don't have a lot of ways of getting new customers early in the consideration cycle, and for Pinners who really think inspiration first, and then they think about what they want to buy as we go down. Part of the next question was, how should we expect that to evolve. There're obviously a couple of macro tailwinds. There's just been an acceleration in e-commerce driven by COVID, and we also continue to build the product. But in terms of quantifying how that will progress, over the short-term, I don't think we have a quantification, over the long-term we believe that we're still very early and that shopping journey as Todd alluded to in his previous answer.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the 3Q guidance. So, when you called out one of the factors could be cases if COVID rising and more lockdowns. I guess with e-commerce surging and you're the micro side of the business improving so much with more advertisers, et cetera. Why are you sort of the view that a faster surge in COVID or lockdown could have a material impact in the business? So we can sort of understand maybe advertiser contribution or any advertiser exposure. And then secondly, in the guide, what are you sort of assuming on the pace of reopening in the U.S.? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks for the question, Brian. So in retail, what we're seeing right now, I mean, first of all, I don't know. We really don't. There's so much uncertainty in the market that we don't have clear visibility on exactly what COVID-19 means for omni channel retail spend on our platform. What we know is that in mid-March, through the end of March, we saw a rapid deceleration in their spend on the platform because of two things. One was stores started to close, and the second is that four essential retailers, they were sold out and they have supply chain issues. So, advertising was not useful when stores were closed or it wasn't effective if they were sold out and couldn't deliver on demand. I don't know what the fall will hold in terms of future lockdowns, but what we're seeing is a rise in cases and the prospect of potentially slower store reopenings, less economic activity, and possibly just that uncertainty in general is something we need to factor in. What we're hearing from retail and advertisers, they have a shorter leash on their budget commitments right now, there are store closures in place and possibly more coming. While, we're still signing large joint business partnerships and seeing a lot of traction with those advertisers, the spend commitments tend to be smaller, more dynamic and more flexible in this environment. So, it's just harder for us to look out very far beyond where we are in the moment. And I kind of hearken back to what we've been trying to do over the last few months, which is to -- in our communications, be very clear about what we're seeing in the business in the moment, at a time of heightened uncertainty, which is why we've given a lot more disclosure about recent performance and monthly updates like we have over the last couple of months. And we've withdrawn our annual guidance, because in this environment just doesn't feel prudent. And that's because of the dynamic flexibility and uncertainty in some of these spend commitments, and dialing back of larger long-term commitments from some of these retail partners.\nBrian Nowak: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: And your next question comes the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. A few questions. I guess, obviously very strong international ads over $100 million over the last year. Where are those user locations? Are they in high value areas for monetization like in Europe or more detail on that would be helpful? And then I noticed in your outlook for at least for 3Q, you didn't mention Apple IDFA changes. Do you expect any impact from that as you look out over the next year? And then maybe one more on just the catalog evolution, where are you? Are you still very early in that? And how would that show up in the user experience? Maybe explain that a little bit to people. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Justin. So, I heard three questions in there. I think I can take the first one on international user growth, and then I heard one on IDFA for Apple and catalogs that perhaps Ben can start and I can pile on if it's helpful. On user growth, the U.S. was our slowest growing geography at 13%. We saw obviously international markets overall grew 49% in the quarter to 321 million users, and our growth in every non-U.S. region exceeded U.S. growth. So, it's very strong growth in our monetizable English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and in Western Europe, where we've been making heavy monetization investments and we've seen good results. We have seen rapid growth in our -- the highest growth rates continue to be in our least mature markets, which is unsurprising. But we are seeing exceptionally strong growth across all geographies. I still expect that we'll be able to monetize a significant majority of our users over the next couple of years. And we are doing exactly that in English speaking countries outside of the U.S. today and in Western Europe. And as we've said historically, the next region for us would be Latin America, which we would expect to begin monetizing probably six months from now.\nBen Silbermann: Great. Justin, I heard two other questions, one about IDFA and the second about catalogs. So, on IDFA based on what Apple has shared, we do expect a new opt-in requirement for IDFA sharing will decrease our ability to measure conversions from iOS apps. So as a result, we're continuing an investment strategy we started last year to increase our tag presence, build first party measurement tools, as well as investing in alternative sources of signal and measurement and things like enhanced match. We also have the ability to leverage on platform signal as people engage primarily with commercial content partnership. So it's something we have our eye on and it fits into a longer-term theme that we've been talking about for a few quarters, about really investing in measurement solutions so advertisers can understand the return on their spend. The second question was around catalogs, and as we mentioned before, we've been extremely excited about progress on shopping in general in catalog uploaded in particular. So, we mentioned the catalog feeds grew 350% quarter-on-quarter, that's a 10x or half over half. Now, that's starting from a very low number, but still the progress has been really encouraging. We also have our VMT program, our Verified Merchant Program, and we're seeing both healthy growth there and healthy retention. And so, all signs are good, but the reason I say we're early is because there's still a lot of stores out there and we continue to invest to make sure that we adjust these catalogs, we understand what's in that catalog and we can give users a great experience. And I think that was the second-half of your question on how do we see the experience. What Pinners have always told us, is they want Pinterest to primarily start with getting inspired with an idea. It could be an image that causes them to think about how they might want to dress differently, or a video about setting up a home gym. And they want to work backwards that inspiration to figure out what are the products that can turn that vision into reality. So, the experience that we envision is that people engage as they do today. They look for inspiration. They save the things they\u2019re excited about the feed board. They think that Pinterest is the place to plan for the future. But, we can actually begin to take them down the path of making that into reality. So in a scene, we can show them the products that are inside of it. They can visit a retailer's page and see their catalog and all the products within it. They can compare items to find the thing that's right for them. And it's that end-to-end experience, that we think is the big opportunity in shopping online. We feel like, once you know exactly what you're looking for, there are actually fantastic options for you to find the lowest price with the lowest shipping, but the problem that\u2019s still really hard for a retailer is, how do I reach a customer who doesn't yet know exactly what product she's looking for. And we believe that one of the key ways to do that is to reach them at the moment of planning an inspiration and to work backwards from there.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question, a couple if I may. First, so user growth seems very strong and led -- it sounds like by a lot call it the nontraditional core demos namely like Millennials and Gen Z. So is this a specific like internal objective to grow into those demos? And if so, can you share a bit of an approach like how the approach has been? How much of this is organic versus concentrated efforts you guys are making? And then, any colors you can share on how users are kind of trending in July? We've heard some of the other names talking about warning signs about engagement headwinds as markets then to reopen. But any color you can share there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Yes, I can start. In terms of user growth, as you mentioned, we did see two areas of real strength. Folks that were coming back to platforms and they tried it at an earlier point, but caused their usage, and then special strength in Gen Z, so folks that are under 25 years old. Now our approach to growth has typically focused on use cases. So the reason when we talk through our core strategic priorities, we say and we really want to make Pinterest useful for as many use cases as possible, is that\u2019s the lens that our users take. And so when we think about growing users, we think about how do we make it more useful in use cases that folks care about. For Gen Z, while some of use cases are the same. There are a few that are different. There's a little bit less focus on cooking for example, and there's more focus on crafts and art. And then, in terms of common things people are still looking for some of our core verticals like TV, fashion, things to make their home more livable. So, we're really taking that approach and some of the investments that we've made to improve the adoption of use cases, run the gamut from the today tab, which kind of guides people in an editorial way to things that we think are relevant right now, to better machine learning and recommendations. So, as people share what they're interested in, we can guide them to an adjacent use case, to making Pinterest just a better tool to go deeper those use cases. And we've launched features like, I'm allowing you to add a date to a board, I'm allowing you to add more project planning tools. I mean, that's the core of how we think about it today. Now, the second question and maybe Todd can chime in as it is really about the growth, looking forward in July. And it might be worthwhile to take a little bit of a step back and talk about the engagement that we're seeing. We've obviously seen an acceleration with COVID, and we think that's partly because folks are at home more, but it's largely also because people are rethinking and they're looking for inspiration on how to rethink some of their day-to-day habits, everything from cooking at home, to their home itself. And so, we see a lot of the users we might have expected to come in the fall actually been pulled forward into July. We're monitoring those engagement stats. And the things that we look at such as the number of searches people perform, the number of boards they create, they look really healthy compared to what we've seen in the past. And so we'll be monitoring that and this is obviously an unprecedented situation. We expect some pullback, but we still think that they're going to settle out well above pre-COVID levels. Anything to add, Todd?\nTodd Morgenfeld: The thing I would add from -- yes, so I think that's the right overall perspective. But I think to this audience, one thing that I did want to point out is because we've had this conversation over the last year. Q2 tends to seasonally be our weakest quarter. So Q1 to Q2, user growth tends to be -- are by far our seasonally weakest quarter. As Ben mentioned, people are typically beginning to go outside of their homes and do things offline. And then we historically have seen user growth sequentially grow stronger in Q3, as people come back inside, they start planning for back-to-school and they start their holiday planning. And this year, people never left their homes. So, it's as Ben mentioned very unprecedented, but because people didn't leave their homes and we've seen this possible pull forward of user growth into Q2, that we typically would have seen in Q3, I would expect that sequential user growth going into Q3 would add about half the typical number that we've seen over the last couple of years of new MAU ads into Q3. So, I think, it's very difficult to say exactly how these cohorts perform. But, given the dynamics that we're seeing, I would expect significantly lower sequential user growth going into Q3, probably half the number that we've seen over the last couple years.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Todd, so maybe you could give us some color just around what you're seeing in terms of overall advertiser numbers or growth, and how that's translating into auction density. And then just related, can you just help us understand some of the volume price trends that you saw during 2Q? And then how that's inflected early in the third quarter so far? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Great. Thanks, Doug. So couple things. One, I'm going to go back to this theme, because I think it's important. What we've been hearing is that ads need to be ROI accountable in this environment, and the advertisers value the commercial planning mindset of our users and the focus on online sales and conversion objectives, like OCPM and shopping. So our investments in tools like auto bid, catalog upload, tag it option partnerships and now emerging tools for agencies. Those things are driving more advertisers to the platform. So, we've seen our advertiser growth in terms of number of advertisers accelerate, again year-over-year and spend from mid-market and managed small and medium business advertisers, who benefit from those tools, measurements, measurement and formats investments, grow significantly to now nearly half of our total revenue. So that's been -- I've been very excited about the strategy that we've been laying out and talking about with you all over the last year. We're seeing that unfold now in terms of the advertiser account and traction in the mid-market. I would expect Doug that over time that translates into more option density as more advertisers are on the platform seeing positive results, that's enabled by the tools that we built in the measurement solutions that we're rolling out. In Q2, it's a bit of a different dynamic, because demand was -- through from April, May and June was different than what we're experiencing today. We did see our ad impression count grow 17% in Q2 and our effective OCPMs or our pricing go down 11% that was driven mostly by the demand picture which was, frankly, healthy and bringing on more performance oriented advertisers around those conversion optimization and shopping objectives, and showing great returns, which we think will drive more people to the platform and we saw that in Q2.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay. Any comment on what's happening there to take you to the 50%-ish growth in July?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Well, it's certainly gotten a couple of things. So we've definitely seen a return of demand and that has been across awareness objectives or brand advertisers and in performance objectives. And the auto bid product improvement that we made for traffic objectives and have now rolled out to our conversion optimization objectives has created more pressure on the option. And we've seen both clear, much better. So, it's been I think a healthy dynamic all the way around. The picture has definitely improved through every month from April, May and June and then an inflection point in July.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great. Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on the technology side of things, specifically what you're seeing in the development of visual search? And to the extent that Jeremy has now sort of been there a little over a year, and surely has his feet well under him at this point, sort of where his priorities lie, I would appreciate sort of any insights and perspective you can share on those?\nBen Silbermann: Sure. So, we continue to invest in computer vision as a core technology. And there's sometimes an impression that computer vision only touches on one product, such as the lens product, which lets you take a photo, but it actually improves the relevance around the product itself. So when we talk about shopping, and being able to match images to products, computer vision needs with that. We talk about recommendations. It helps with that as well. And so we continue to make large investments in machine learning more broadly and computer vision specifically. In terms of some of the areas that Jeremy's looking at, look, there's a mix, there's obviously what we call our technical foundations. And we've been working on building a lot of our core platforms in a way that are more scalable. But we see an opportunity to continue to unify the way that we rank and look at both organic content and our advertising content. And that really is about the fundamental alignment that we know from the user's perspective exists between their goal, which is to get inspired and turn those things into something in real life, as well as the advertisers goal, which is to inspire the customers, get people all the way to a transaction. That continues to be a core focus, as well as making sure we're building efficient infrastructure, and also making sure that the service remains reliable and scalable as we grow.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Jane Penner for closing remarks.\nJane Penner: Thanks everyone. That concludes our Q2, 2020 earnings conference call. I'm going turn the call over to Ben for some closing remarks.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Jane. I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us. Definitely, we appreciate your questions. And as always, we look forward to stay engaged with you in the future. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call for the Pinterest second quarter earnings. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I want to give some brief color on the trends we've seen to-date in revenue, as well as to provide an informal outlook for both revenue and costs in Q3. I'll begin with a summary of the headlines and then we can go into more detail. Starting with Q2 revenue, we saw advertiser demand improve each month of the quarter. April was the weakest month in the immediate aftermath of sheltering in place. May growth rates improved and June showed further improvement. In July, we've seen a sharp acceleration in revenue to about 50% year-over-year growth, through July 29. We expect that revenue will grow in the mid-30s percent range year-over-year in Q3, this growth rate assumes a deceleration from the strong growth we've seen so far in July. I'll say more about this shortly. First to unpack what we've seen to-date and what we currently know to be driving our results, then I'll discuss our outlook and the significant uncertainties that we're facing. Q2 is characterized by initial softness in advertising demand and then a partial return of that demand. The formula was triggered by COVID-19-related lockdowns and the latter by the return of economic activity as those lockdowns eased. We saw ad demand recover across many verticals starting in May, with CPG showing particular momentum in the latter part of June and into July. The retail vertical lagged CPG, but has recently begun to recover as well. This was the pattern in both the U.S. and in international markets, but non-U.S. markets recovered a bit faster. On top of the macro driven recovery and advertising demand, we're seeing a lot of demand for Pinterest ad products in particular. Here's what our advertisers are telling us. First, our ads are working, especially for marketers seeking sales and conversions. The investments we've made in conversion optimization or OCPM shopping ads and auto bids are making it easier for these advertisers to hit their goals. In a world where their balance sheets are at risk, marketers want ROI accountable ads and we are delivering them. This has bolstered our ability to attract performance oriented medium-sized advertisers, a group that emerged as a key driver of our resilience in Q2. Second, the commercial mindset of our users is very attractive right now, because many advertisers want to drive online sales and Pinterest tend to be in market consumers. The early commercial intent on our platform also informs the insights we share with advertisers. And they are increasingly using these insights to understand leading indicators of demand in this unprecedented environment. In the words of the Head of U.S. Media at Ford, \"I received a report that was incredibly interesting from Pinterest. They showed how people's behavior on the platform is changing from the types of behaviors you'd expect during shelter-in-place, recipes, crafts with kids, baking bread, deploying oriented behaviors, for example, thinking about vacations. Sure, we can always look at the quant data, leading indicators, traffic reports, et cetera. But to get at something that unlocks what people are actually thinking about, even if they're not saying it is really important. That's where the relationships really come to life between marketers and the platforms.\" Finally, advertisers feel Pinterest is brand space relative to other platforms. In a moment where there is a lot of hostile political conversation happening on social media, advertisers are looking for new places to put their dollars. We benefited from this in July. As I noted earlier, we expect that revenue will grow in the mid-30s percent range year-over-year in Q3, which implies a deceleration from the roughly 50% year-over-year growth rate we've seen quarter to-date through July. Let me unpack this. One month may not be representative of the full quarter and there's significant uncertainty for the following reasons. First, cases of COVID-19 arising and any new lockdowns would likely have a negative impact on advertiser demand. Second, our main seasonal moment in Q3 back-to-school will likely look very different this year, as schools across the U.S. embrace distance learning. This could lower both engagement and advertiser demand. Third, it's not clear, if or how long the tailwind we've experienced in July from advertisers boycotting social media will last. Finally, revenue growth in August and September 2019 was stronger relative to July 2019, when a product change briefly lowered our conversion optimization revenue. So year-over-year comparisons will be harder for remainder of the quarter. I also want to address our costs before opening it up for Q&A. On our Q1 call, I said we expected to grow operating expenses year-over-year in the second quarter, but we just reported a slight decline in this number. This was the result of implementing cost savings measures more quickly and our work from home model to a larger extent than we originally expected. We continue to invest for growth across our key strategic priorities of content, ads diversification, use case expansion and shopping. To that end, we grew headcount 21% year-over-year and 5% sequentially during the second quarter. We expect to grow OpEx in Q3 both sequentially and year-over-year to pursue the long term vision of the company, while continuing to monitor and to respond to the ever changing environment. I hope this detail has been informative and helpful. With that, I can turn it back to the operator and we can begin to take some questions. Sure. And on the second part of your question on automatic bidding, we start with why auto bid matters. Before automatic bidding, advertisers had to constantly manage their bid strategy in a dynamic auction. Now the auto bid tool does this for them and it aims to get advertisers the most clicks at the lowest possible Cost per Click or CPC or topic objectives, while spending their entire budget. We made a lot of progress on that during Q2. The last time we talked about 50% of our traffic objectives were flowing through auto bid. And now about 80% of CPC revenue is going through auto bid. And so budget utilizations have remained high for auto bid traffic objectives. And basically, we're better able to clear existing budgets and deliver more efficient cost per click, and generally higher click through rates. So, in other words, the advertisers are seeing a better return on their spend through auto bid, and we're taking the friction out of the process through better tooling. What I would say is, and one example of that is ARM & HAMMER baking soda, where for Do-It-Yourself, home science project campaign for kids. They were driving 77% more efficient cost per clicks on 23% higher click through rates. And so that's a specific example of how this can work for an advertiser. In general, what that's meant is we're better able to deliver against the budgets that are in the system today. And as advertisers are seeing these sorts of good returns and performance, we would expect over time for there to be more budget in the system. It's worth noting, in addition to the traffic objective auto bid that we did launch, as we said, we would a couple months ago, auto bid for our OCPM objective a few weeks ago, and we're seeing very good early traction there too. Sure. I know last time, we talked a lot about the macro environment and because we grew the business initially on the back of omni channel, larger omni channel retail and CPG, we had exposure as some of those advertisers pulled back. We talked a lot about how non-essential retailers were suffering from store closures and essential retailers were sold out. And so that was a tough mix for us when they were pulling back for very different reasons. We have seen some recovery, I would say, it started with CPG and we've seen a lot of momentum there. On the retail side, the growth and the return of span has lagged CPG, but it has come back to some extent, as stores have reopened and as essential retailers have figured out their supply chain issues. I've been more encouraged by what I talked about in the opening remarks, about the strategic investments that we've made in our product and in our strategy to diversify our advertiser base into the mid-market, through improved tools, measurement and formats, driving resilience in the quarter and growth. And so I would say, we've seen three things drive the performance, both in Q2 and through July. One is the macro recovery that you talked about that extends across non-essential and essential retail and more notably in CPG. The second is all of the strategic investments we've made in our business and in our product, which is touched or been more exposed to the mid-market segment that we've been talking about for a while, in the spirit of driving ads diversification and more relevant content on the platform through conversion activities. The third thing you noted was around the boycotts. And what I would say about the boycotts, it's been a tailwind, but we do believe the majority of our growth in July has been driven by advertising demand, stemming from those strategic investments in the ad products that we've made over the last year and a half. It's not really clear how sustainable that boycott tailwind is. The boycott has given us an opportunity to win some budgets and to educate advertisers about how and why Pinterest is different. And while other platforms are at the center of political and free speech debates, people come to Pinterest to think optimistically about their futures. And that's especially relevant today, as we provide a respite from what could be one of the most contentious political news cycles in history. Being a service where people envision and plan their lives also creates opportunities, particularly as advertisers seek positive platforms to build their brands and to drive sales. So, we're seeing some evidence of more advertisers choosing Pinterest for this reason in July, it's really hard for us to say how sustainable or significant that trend is. We are tracking spend from advertisers who are participating in the boycott, but we don't know how much of that spent would have come to us anyway, because many of those advertisers do spend on both platforms over time, versus incremental spend due to the boycott. So we can't really quantify the impact precisely at this point. Sure. So on the first, Ben may have some more color on this as well from a strategic perspective. But, I think your questions were more around leverage in the model. And I want to go back as you rightly noted, we talked a lot about how shopping will evolve online. And I think in this environment that's been accelerated. So, I'm very happy that we identified entering the year that we were going to prioritize shopping even more than we had historically, which is oppression. Our investments in e-commerce and shopping most notably have been improving the user experience. So, helping people find new ideas and bring them into their lives by discovering new products. And that's been enabled, as Ben mentioned, by better catalog ingestion and improving the high intense shopping surface experience for users on Pinterest. From a shopping advertising perspective, we noted that a lot of our growth came from conversion optimization and shopping ads, which are closer to online sales and conversion activity in an ROI accountable world. The financial contribution of shopping ads right now is still early days. We're focused mostly on allowing users to find new things and bringing them into their lives and improve that organic shopping experience, knowing that over time we'll start to see more revenue contribution from shopping, as we continue to improve the experience and convince advertisers that early intent on the platform is something that they want to promote against. So, I wouldn't, -- if you're thinking about shopping being a driver in the near-term, I would think of it as more of a contribution next year and beyond. On the international side, we made a lot of investments over the last year plus in building out in particular in Western Europe, more direct coverage and related sales support functions outside of the U.S., but mostly in the English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and Western Europe. We are hiring pretty aggressively in those markets leading into the COVID-19 shut down. And we found that those investments have been paying off nicely. And I think you've seen that in our results, where in the last quarter we grew international revenues 72%, despite all the industry headwinds. We will continue to build that out. I would say that there's still a lot of opportunity even in those markets where we have been making investments and scaling the business. We also have other unmonetized in large growing user bases like in Latin America, that over time we'll also monetize. So, a lot more to come there in terms of leverage in the model. In terms of the decel [ph], we did want to -- I tried to point out in the opening comments that there's just a lot in front of us right now. We don't know what the back-to-school environment will look like. It will be different. We know we've got this headwind that I called out from a much weaker July a year ago than we had this year. And there's a lot of uncertainty around COVID as we go into the fall. So, my expectation is that we will see some moderation in that growth. And frankly, as Ross pointed out around the boycott, we don't really know how much is there and how sustainable the spend that we are getting from the boycott might be. And so we try to capture all that in the mid-30s guidance. Thanks for the question, Brian. So in retail, what we're seeing right now, I mean, first of all, I don't know. We really don't. There's so much uncertainty in the market that we don't have clear visibility on exactly what COVID-19 means for omni channel retail spend on our platform. What we know is that in mid-March, through the end of March, we saw a rapid deceleration in their spend on the platform because of two things. One was stores started to close, and the second is that four essential retailers, they were sold out and they have supply chain issues. So, advertising was not useful when stores were closed or it wasn't effective if they were sold out and couldn't deliver on demand. I don't know what the fall will hold in terms of future lockdowns, but what we're seeing is a rise in cases and the prospect of potentially slower store reopenings, less economic activity, and possibly just that uncertainty in general is something we need to factor in. What we're hearing from retail and advertisers, they have a shorter leash on their budget commitments right now, there are store closures in place and possibly more coming. While, we're still signing large joint business partnerships and seeing a lot of traction with those advertisers, the spend commitments tend to be smaller, more dynamic and more flexible in this environment. So, it's just harder for us to look out very far beyond where we are in the moment. And I kind of hearken back to what we've been trying to do over the last few months, which is to -- in our communications, be very clear about what we're seeing in the business in the moment, at a time of heightened uncertainty, which is why we've given a lot more disclosure about recent performance and monthly updates like we have over the last couple of months. And we've withdrawn our annual guidance, because in this environment just doesn't feel prudent. And that's because of the dynamic flexibility and uncertainty in some of these spend commitments, and dialing back of larger long-term commitments from some of these retail partners. Thanks, Justin. So, I heard three questions in there. I think I can take the first one on international user growth, and then I heard one on IDFA for Apple and catalogs that perhaps Ben can start and I can pile on if it's helpful. On user growth, the U.S. was our slowest growing geography at 13%. We saw obviously international markets overall grew 49% in the quarter to 321 million users, and our growth in every non-U.S. region exceeded U.S. growth. So, it's very strong growth in our monetizable English speaking countries outside of the U.S. and in Western Europe, where we've been making heavy monetization investments and we've seen good results. We have seen rapid growth in our -- the highest growth rates continue to be in our least mature markets, which is unsurprising. But we are seeing exceptionally strong growth across all geographies. I still expect that we'll be able to monetize a significant majority of our users over the next couple of years. And we are doing exactly that in English speaking countries outside of the U.S. today and in Western Europe. And as we've said historically, the next region for us would be Latin America, which we would expect to begin monetizing probably six months from now. The thing I would add from -- yes, so I think that's the right overall perspective. But I think to this audience, one thing that I did want to point out is because we've had this conversation over the last year. Q2 tends to seasonally be our weakest quarter. So Q1 to Q2, user growth tends to be -- are by far our seasonally weakest quarter. As Ben mentioned, people are typically beginning to go outside of their homes and do things offline. And then we historically have seen user growth sequentially grow stronger in Q3, as people come back inside, they start planning for back-to-school and they start their holiday planning. And this year, people never left their homes. So, it's as Ben mentioned very unprecedented, but because people didn't leave their homes and we've seen this possible pull forward of user growth into Q2, that we typically would have seen in Q3, I would expect that sequential user growth going into Q3 would add about half the typical number that we've seen over the last couple of years of new MAU ads into Q3. So, I think, it's very difficult to say exactly how these cohorts perform. But, given the dynamics that we're seeing, I would expect significantly lower sequential user growth going into Q3, probably half the number that we've seen over the last couple years. Great. Thanks, Doug. So couple things. One, I'm going to go back to this theme, because I think it's important. What we've been hearing is that ads need to be ROI accountable in this environment, and the advertisers value the commercial planning mindset of our users and the focus on online sales and conversion objectives, like OCPM and shopping.

And we've seen both clear, much better. So, it's been I think a healthy dynamic all the way around. The picture has definitely improved through every month from April, May and June and then an inflection point in July."

            "name": "Ben Silbermann",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. Thanks a lot for joining the call this morning. Todd and I will be giving some brief opening remarks, touching on our results and our four strategic priorities, which are making Pinterest home to the most inspiring content, helping Pinners discover more use cases, making Pinterest more shoppable and scaling our ad business, then we'll be happy to take your questions. But before going into business results as we usually do, I just want to acknowledge that this period feels like anything, but business as usual for people and businesses here in the U.S. and across the world. First, there's COVID-19, which in addition to being a global health threat is impacting how people live and work, including all of us here at Pinterest. We're learning how to operate as a distributed workforce, and in this new climate, we're going to keep making collaboration and efficiency a priority, so we can keep delivering for Pinners and for our advertisers. In addition, here in the U.S., we're experiencing historic moment for racial justice, one that's leading companies to look at what they can do better, and Pinterest is no exception. We've made a number of commitments to drive change from improving representation in our product to increasing the diversity of our workforce, especially in senior roles. I know that this is not how most earning calls begin, but I want to be transparent with all of you and with the public that we're not just focused on what we're doing as a business, but also how we do business. These issues are top of mind with everything we do, and we're going to work hard to do right by all of our stakeholders. Now on to our business results. Pinterest had a strong Q2, in both the U.S. and international markets. More people came to Pinterest looking for inspiration than ever before. We ended the quarter with 416 million monthly active users, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. In particular, we saw strong growth from resurrected users, as well as from users under the age of 25, who grew twice as fast as users over 25. These users came looking for ideas as they adjusted to life during a global pandemic, and with new tools like the today tab, we help connect them to new use cases, everything from home office setups to recipes to cook at home to different summer activities for kids. We also continue to make our content more inspirational, and one example of this is video, which offers pinners another dynamic and engaging way to discover ideas. During Q2, total daily video views, which include both organic and paid, grew over 150% year-over-year, and we're looking to do more in the space. In addition, we also connected Pinterest to more shoppable content, so they can turn their plans into a reality. We saw catalog uploads from businesses increased by more than 350% from Q1 to Q2. And we built new features like our Shop tab and the ability to shop from boards to make it easier for Pinners to find this content. So in total, we're making a lot of progress in helping pinners find inspiration for their lives. This is work that, in my mind, because of everything happening in the world, is as meaningful and relevant as it has been in the last decade. And here to share more about what all this is meant for advertisers in our overall business is our CFO, Todd. This is Ben, thanks for the question. Why don't I tackle your first question about user engagement, and then I'll turn it over to Todd around kind of all those on budgets. So, the question was how are new users engaging differently? And in particular, how are they engaging with some of the shopping surfaces? So, we find that the use cases that people are coming to Pinterest for are broadly similar, in that people are looking for ways of establishing new habits, especially in the time of change. So, many of our core use cases around making the home more livable, personal well-being and fitness does continue to be themes. Although, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, and we're seeing particular strengths in the growth of folks that are under the age of 25. The second part of the question was, how are these users engaging with some of the new shopping features. And we're seeing good engagement, although it still remains early. We've shipped shopping only surfaces and engagement with those surfaces up to 50% in the first-half of 2020. And we're also seeing more product only searches, which have grown by 8x in 2020. As you know, from previous calls our strategy in shopping is to make these surfaces, but to also make sure that they're filled with highly relevant products. And the two things we're doing to drive that are increase the number of merchants who have uploaded their catalog, and we saw a sharp increase in the number of catalog feeds uploaded, up 360% sequentially. And then to use machine learning and computer vision technology to make sure that we're matching the right products to inspiring themes. I hope that gives some color on shopping engagement and initial engagement [ph]. Todd? Thanks, Michael. I can start off. So the question was how much of the progress that we're seeing on shopping is being driven by partnerships like the one we have with Shopify, and then how do we expect it to kind of move forward in the future? So, Shopify, we're very happy and very early on in that partnership. For those who haven't read this previously, that partnership allows a Shopify merchant with one click to set up a presence on Pinterest to upload their catalog. I would say that it's still early days and it's one of several partnerships that are important to us. And if you just take a step back, Pinterest's long-term vision for shopping is to really build a full funnel experience. So, we want to take people from the moment of inspiration when they first get an idea, and then play them all the way through so they can identify products that can make that inspiration a reality and eventually purchased. And that's going to be a long-term road. We're very focused right now I mean at the top in the middle of the funnel. So, we're improving the amount of inventory we have and we're building surfaces that keep Pinterest an inspiring place. But when the time is right, push people to identify the products they really want to buy. And that's the value proposition we want, both for retailers who really don't have a lot of ways of getting new customers early in the consideration cycle, and for Pinners who really think inspiration first, and then they think about what they want to buy as we go down. Part of the next question was, how should we expect that to evolve. There're obviously a couple of macro tailwinds. There's just been an acceleration in e-commerce driven by COVID, and we also continue to build the product. But in terms of quantifying how that will progress, over the short-term, I don't think we have a quantification, over the long-term we believe that we're still very early and that shopping journey as Todd alluded to in his previous answer. Great. Justin, I heard two other questions, one about IDFA and the second about catalogs. So, on IDFA based on what Apple has shared, we do expect a new opt-in requirement for IDFA sharing will decrease our ability to measure conversions from iOS apps. So as a result, we're continuing an investment strategy we started last year to increase our tag presence, build first party measurement tools, as well as investing in alternative sources of signal and measurement and things like enhanced match. We also have the ability to leverage on platform signal as people engage primarily with commercial content partnership. So it's something we have our eye on and it fits into a longer-term theme that we've been talking about for a few quarters, about really investing in measurement solutions so advertisers can understand the return on their spend. The second question was around catalogs, and as we mentioned before, we've been extremely excited about progress on shopping in general in catalog uploaded in particular. So, we mentioned the catalog feeds grew 350% quarter-on-quarter, that's a 10x or half over half. Now, that's starting from a very low number, but still the progress has been really encouraging. We also have our VMT program, our Verified Merchant Program, and we're seeing both healthy growth there and healthy retention. And so, all signs are good, but the reason I say we're early is because there's still a lot of stores out there and we continue to invest to make sure that we adjust these catalogs, we understand what's in that catalog and we can give users a great experience. And I think that was the second-half of your question on how do we see the experience. What Pinners have always told us, is they want Pinterest to primarily start with getting inspired with an idea. It could be an image that causes them to think about how they might want to dress differently, or a video about setting up a home gym. And they want to work backwards that inspiration to figure out what are the products that can turn that vision into reality. So, the experience that we envision is that people engage as they do today. They look for inspiration. They save the things they're excited about the feed board. They think that Pinterest is the place to plan for the future. But, we can actually begin to take them down the path of making that into reality. So in a scene, we can show them the products that are inside of it. They can visit a retailer's page and see their catalog and all the products within it. They can compare items to find the thing that's right for them. And it's that end-to-end experience, that we think is the big opportunity in shopping online. We feel like, once you know exactly what you're looking for, there are actually fantastic options for you to find the lowest price with the lowest shipping, but the problem that's still really hard for a retailer is, how do I reach a customer who doesn't yet know exactly what product she's looking for. And we believe that one of the key ways to do that is to reach them at the moment of planning an inspiration and to work backwards from there. Yes, I can start. In terms of user growth, as you mentioned, we did see two areas of real strength. Folks that were coming back to platforms and they tried it at an earlier point, but caused their usage, and then special strength in Gen Z, so folks that are under 25 years old. Now our approach to growth has typically focused on use cases. So the reason when we talk through our core strategic priorities, we say and we really want to make Pinterest useful for as many use cases as possible, is that's the lens that our users take. And so when we think about growing users, we think about how do we make it more useful in use cases that folks care about. For Gen Z, while some of use cases are the same. There are a few that are different. There's a little bit less focus on cooking for example, and there's more focus on crafts and art. And then, in terms of common things people are still looking for some of our core verticals like TV, fashion, things to make their home more livable. So, we're really taking that approach and some of the investments that we've made to improve the adoption of use cases, run the gamut from the today tab, which kind of guides people in an editorial way to things that we think are relevant right now, to better machine learning and recommendations. So, as people share what they're interested in, we can guide them to an adjacent use case, to making Pinterest just a better tool to go deeper those use cases. And we've launched features like, I'm allowing you to add a date to a board, I'm allowing you to add more project planning tools. I mean, that's the core of how we think about it today. Now, the second question and maybe Todd can chime in as it is really about the growth, looking forward in July. And it might be worthwhile to take a little bit of a step back and talk about the engagement that we're seeing. We've obviously seen an acceleration with COVID, and we think that's partly because folks are at home more, but it's largely also because people are rethinking and they're looking for inspiration on how to rethink some of their day-to-day habits, everything from cooking at home, to their home itself. And so, we see a lot of the users we might have expected to come in the fall actually been pulled forward into July. We're monitoring those engagement stats. And the things that we look at such as the number of searches people perform, the number of boards they create, they look really healthy compared to what we've seen in the past. And so we'll be monitoring that and this is obviously an unprecedented situation. We expect some pullback, but we still think that they're going to settle out well above pre-COVID levels. Anything to add, Todd? Sure. So, we continue to invest in computer vision as a core technology. And there's sometimes an impression that computer vision only touches on one product, such as the lens product, which lets you take a photo, but it actually improves the relevance around the product itself. So when we talk about shopping, and being able to match images to products, computer vision needs with that. We talk about recommendations. It helps with that as well. And so we continue to make large investments in machine learning more broadly and computer vision specifically. In terms of some of the areas that Jeremy's looking at, look, there's a mix, there's obviously what we call our technical foundations. And we've been working on building a lot of our core platforms in a way that are more scalable. But we see an opportunity to continue to unify the way that we rank and look at both organic content and our advertising content. And that really is about the fundamental alignment that we know from the user's perspective exists between their goal, which is to get inspired and turn those things into something in real life, as well as the advertisers goal, which is to inspire the customers, get people all the way to a transaction. That continues to be a core focus, as well as making sure we're building efficient infrastructure, and also making sure that the service remains reliable and scalable as we grow. Thanks, Jane. I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us. Definitely, we appreciate your questions. And as always, we look forward to stay engaged with you in the future. Have a great day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pinterest First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. You may begin your conference.\nJane Penner: Thank you, Brent. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest\u2019s earnings conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, our President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer. Now, I\u2019ll cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business and financial performance and operations, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Our results for Q2 2020 are preliminary and may not be an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ben.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, the world has changed a lot since we did our last call back in February. And on behalf of our entire company, I just want to thank all the heroes out there who are helping people through this tough time. Like every person in every business, we\u2019re figuring out how to manage and work through the current health and economic crisis, and that starts with making sure employees are safe and healthy. It also means ensuring that Pinterest is a valuable resource for people as they adjust to life in this new reality. Over the last month-and-a-half, we\u2019ve learned that our mission of bringing everyone inspiration to their lives has never been more relevant than it is right now. Over the past weeks, we\u2019ve seen record-high engagement from existing users, resurrected users and new users. Prior to COVID-19, we saw gains driven by product investments that are detailed in this quarter\u2019s and past shareholder letters. The stay-at-home orders that began in mid-March significantly accelerated this trend. When the COVID crisis began, we immediately prioritized the safety of our users by helping them find reliable health information during the pandemic. And as people start practical solutions for challenges created by the crisis, they discovered new ways to use Pinterest and also deepened their existing uses of services. They search for things like recipes for freezer-friendly meals, getting ideas for home-schooling, researching home gym equipment, or figuring out how to do haircuts from home. We\u2019re proud that Pinterest is helping people all over the world get through this difficult time. We\u2019re also working with advertisers as they adjust to this new economic climate. The quarter began with a continuation of the strength we\u2019ve seen in Q4, but the pandemic began to impact our business during March. As offline stores closed around the world, many advertisers slowed or paused their advertising spending on Pinterest. For those advertisers that paused, we\u2019re sharing our insights to help them plan and eventually reaccelerate and reactivate their spend. Pinterest is where consumers have always looked for ideas and plan their lives, and we\u2019re offering CMOs valuable insights to help them decide how to spend their 2020 budgets. For those advertisers that continue to spend, we\u2019ve seen a shift away from awareness campaigns and towards highly performant ads, an area we\u2019ve invested heavily in over the past year. As a result, our conversion optimization ads and shopping ads are much bigger part of our product mix today than they were a year ago. These ads are delivering real value to marketers with ROI accountable objectives, particularly as Pinners engagement with shopping surfaces has increased significantly over the same period. Finally, while we\u2019re working to help Pinners and advertisers to this current crisis, we remain firmly committed to our long-term strategies. We continue to invest in our vision to be the home of the Internet\u2019s most inspiring content, to help users discover more ways to use Pinterest in their lives, to let Pinners easily purchase things they find on our surface and to create value for a much more diverse base of advertisers. We have the benefit of having a balance sheet that allows us to continue to pursue these outcomes. As you know, we withdrew annual guidance, because we have limited visibility to future advertiser demands. That remains the case, but Todd and I will continue to provide as much transparency into our current business as possible, as things evolve in the coming months. With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Q&A. Brent, we\u2019re ready for our first question.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just a couple of questions. First is, can you just tell us what you\u2019re seeing thus far in 2Q? And if we look at your retail advertiser category, how much of the revenue is coming from digitally native e-commerce companies versus retailers that have the big offline stores presence? And could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing, I guess, broadly across retail and CPG thus far in 2Q? And then the second question is, Ben, you mentioned in the letter that usage dipped a little bit in the early days of the quarantine, and you just mentioned that we\u2019re now seeing like record engagement. So is record means a lot of things, given that you guys are growing? I guess, the question is, are MAU growth rates accelerating in April or since late March and into April as a result of COVID relative to the 6% U.S. growth rate and 34% international growth rate in 1Q? Thanks a lot.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. Ross, why don\u2019t I start with your second question on engagement, and then Todd will talk about outlook in Q2 and some of what we\u2019re seeing in retail and CPG. So, as mentioned in the shareholder letter, when the pandemic first started, we saw an initial dip in engagement as people just got prepared, and then we saw a steadily rising engagement. We saw that across both brand-new users. So roughly, 50% of the engagement we saw were from people that were new to Pinterest. We also saw significant growth amongst existing users and resurrected users. So across all fronts, we saw really strong engagement. And we\u2019ve talked in past calls about how we look at a basket of different metrics. Across all those metrics, we saw pretty significant increases. So, for example, searches were up more than 60% year-over-year. New board creations, which does indicate that people are using Pinterest for new use cases, were up 60% year-on-year. Pinner views on their own boards, that was also up 60%. And then we continue to see strong growth in the usage of video, which has been a longstanding trend. As we look forward into April, there are probably two aspects. First, we would expect overall for there to be a slowing of that growth just as people spend less time online. At the same time, the things that we typically look at, which are the indicators of sustained user engagement, things like people creating brand-new boards, doing searches across multiple use cases, those early indicators look really strong. So we do expect to retain some of that engagement, but not at the same rate. It\u2019s obviously an unprecedented situation. So we don\u2019t know exactly how that will mete out. But we\u2019ve been really excited about the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the Board, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to serve those Pinners going forward. Todd, I can turn it over to you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, sure. So, Ross, I heard a couple of questions in there. One was an update on what we\u2019re seeing into the early part of Q2 through April? And the second was a little bit more color on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of vertical impact? And I\u2019ll take those in turn. So first, on the revenue side through the course of April, we\u2019re still obviously in the middle of a highly uncertain environment, driven by COVID-19. And so what we wanted to do on this call was share what we know, what we\u2019ve actually experienced rather than project things that we don\u2019t yet know because of the amount of uncertainty in the market. We had a very strong start to Q1 that persisted through January and February. But as we noted in the letter, we had a sharp deceleration in year-over-year growth trends that really started in earnest in mid-March. That sharp deceleration persisted through the latter half of March, and then we began to see stabilization in our revenue \u2013 year-over-year revenue growth in early April. That stabilization persisted through the course of the month and into early May. To quantify that a bit further, our revenue for the month of April on a year-over-year basis declined 8%. And what I want to note here is, as a reminder, if you remember the call from a year ago, around Q2, we talked about Easter timing. And a year ago in the month of April, Easter provided a little bit more than an extra week of benefit. So on a normalized basis, we\u2019re probably a point or two better than the 8% decline that we noted or experienced in the month of April. So that\u2019s the April trends point. On the vertical piece, the impact has been uneven across the verticals where we\u2019re in market. And that\u2019s not \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise, because the impact of the pandemic has been relatively uneven across verticals as well. Our major verticals, CPG and retail, I\u2019ll pick those, I think, you highlighted those, it\u2019s two that you wanted a bit more color on. In the CPG space, things like food and beverage, health and beauty had relatively better demand in the early part of this crisis, because people were preparing to shelter in place in their homes. But even those advertisers began to experience supply chain difficulties that had various impacts on their appetite for spend. In retail, the impact was a bit more pronounced. You might imagine that omni-channel retail stores \u2013 or omni-channel retailers that had stores that were closed had a significant pullback on spend, whereas direct-to-consumer brands grew relatively faster. In fact, our direct-to-consumer advertising cohort grew significantly faster than the rest of the business. But those advertisers, as we\u2019ve noted, historically, are not a huge part of our revenue mix. We\u2019ve also noticed historically that some of the most impacted verticals, areas like travel, automotive and restaurants were significantly impacted, but those constitute relatively smaller exposure for us. So hopefully, that gets to your two points on recent revenue trends and some of the color around our vertical exposure. The only thing I would add there, just one extra point, and you didn\u2019t ask, Ross, but it\u2019s probably worth noting that we have these joint business partnerships that we sometimes sign with prospective advertisers. So these are not contracts to spend, but they\u2019re indications of intent to spend. And we saw the number of those deals grow over the course of Q1 this year relative to last year, and the dollars covered by those agreements more than doubled year-over-year. So that was a good indication of intent to spend across our advertising base and that trend has persisted even through April, where we\u2019ve continued to sign some of those deals. So I wouldn\u2019t want to over-index on what that means, because none of those deals are a contractual obligation. But we\u2019re still very actively involved with major retailers and seeing good intent there.\nRoss Sandler: Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Let me try two questions. The new users that are coming on, is it too early to know what their experience is going to be like, their level of engagement is like versus prior cohorts? Secondly, I think, you\u2019ve been asked this in the past, but would you \u2013 how would you characterize your mix of awareness versus performance advertisers? And I\u2019m sorry, a third quick question. When you talk about OpEx growth outlook in Q2 lower than the growth \u2013 lower than in Q1, do you mean that on a GAAP or a non-GAAP basis? Thank you very much.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Great. So I don\u2019t know, Ben, if you want to talk a little bit about the new users and engagement, and I can take the second two on brand and performance and expense guidance.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. So on new users, we continue to see really similar behavior across those new users. And so a lot of the reasons they were coming to Pinterest were things that were directly related to COVID-19. So things like meal preparation, making your home more livable, interested in things like home and garden. And so those topics look really similar. And as I mentioned earlier, the engagement trends from those folks looks promising, meaning that they\u2019re taking all of the actions that in the past had helped us predict whether a user would be a long-term user. Now, the situation is different. So we have to wait to see what that looks like. The other thing that\u2019s worth noting is that we continue to see strength from, especially younger users. So we\u2019ve mentioned this in the last call, but we\u2019re seeing really rapid growth in the population of users that are under 25, which we take as a positive sign, because it\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re kind of expanding into a new demographic. Todd, you want to talk about the performance mix and OpEx?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, yes. So, Mark, the second couple of pieces of your question here. On the formats, what we\u2019ve talked about in the past is that, we are a majority performance business and a minority brand/awareness business, just in terms of revenue contribution. And I\u2019ll go into a little bit more color there. But we\u2019ve invested in a full funnel ads business. And the reason we\u2019ve done that is because of the the mindset that our users bring. When our users come to Pinterest, they come with commercial intent. They\u2019re coming to plan something that they want to do in their real life and they go all the way from discovering an idea or being inspired ultimately, in many cases, to buying something. The second thing is worth noting is, advertisers tell us that their spend is ever more returns accountable. We know that advertising spend \u2013 the long-term trend in advertising is that, it\u2019s ever more ROI accountable. And so it\u2019s been very important for us as we invest in our ads product to build measurable value for conversion-oriented advertisers. We saw some trends around our conversion optimization and shopping products that grew much quicker than the rest of the business, reflecting the attributable conversion growth that we continue to see spike through the course of the quarter and into April, and we\u2019ve been investing in that in three ways: our tools and automation, we rolled out, I think, we added in the letter that we had automated bidding for our traffic objectives, which improved click delivery on the same budget, which was an important innovation and one that will extend to further products as the year unfolds; more work on creative and formats: and against measurement, where we\u2019re showing more conversion activity against different attribution windows and better offline to online conversion matching. So that coupled with all the tag integration work that we\u2019ve been talking about for sometime is leading to a stronger performance business. So going back to your question, we continue to be performance-heavy in terms of mix or the majority of our business is performance versus brand/awareness. And we saw significant improvements in our conversion optimization and shopping product formats over the course of the quarter. The automated \u2013 the bidding automation improvements that we made had a big impact on our traffic business as well, but that was in flux over the course of the quarter. So hopefully, that gets to your question on what we\u2019re seeing in formats. On the OpEx growth piece, I\u2019ll answer two questions. One, you didn\u2019t ask, but I think it\u2019ll probably come up. On the gross margin piece, I just wanted to remind folks that our cost of revenue for the business really is more tied to the number of users, the depth of their engagement and usage, along with product complexity. So this isn\u2019t \u2013 our cost of revenue doesn\u2019t scale with revenue, it scales with the number of users and their engagement. So we wanted to call out just to make sure there was no daylight between the way we\u2019re viewing our gross margin performance through the year in this odd market environment, where engagement trends are spiking at exactly the moment when the demand picture is more mixed. On the OpEx side, we continue to focus on and are excited about the long-term opportunity in front of us as a business. We believe in the potential of Pinterest and as a result of that, we\u2019re staying focused on the four big pillars of investment that we opened at the start of the year: investing in inspiring content, more use cases for our users, an improved shopping experience and diversifying our advertiser base. So we \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to invest in those things. And the reason we\u2019re investing in this environment is, one, we believe in the long-term potential of the business, we think that, that remains unchanged. We have the balance sheet to do it with $1.07 billion in cash and $500 million undrawn revolver. And we believe that in this market environment, retooling things like travel, event spending and marketing will allow us to dial back the growth of our investments prudently while we still invest in the core strategic pillars that will drive long-term value. So I don\u2019t know, Mark, if that gets to your \u2013 oh, yes, you also asked about non-GAAP versus GAAP. That was designed to be more of a non-GAAP comment.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I think that\u2019s a little bit more the performance, in particular, some of the bottom of the funnel initiatives that you\u2019re working on. I know recently, you\u2019ve launched the stop, shop and search, shop from Pin. I\u2019d love just to understand a little bit about what traction you\u2019re seeing there? Any response back from advertisers? Uptake, anything like that would be very helpful? And then secondly, internally, as you think about your resources and resource allocation, we\u2019ve heard from others about shifting around resources to where there\u2019s demand today, which seems to kind of skew towards direct response performance. Anything you can share on that would be very helpful as well? Thank you.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. I guess, to start it on the shopping, we\u2019ve outlined in past calls that we kind of have a three-part shopping strategy. And so the first is that we want to continue to grow high-quality inventory, and we have two projects against that, our catalog uploader, and we\u2019ve been really excited. We\u2019ve seen catalog uploads increase about 140% sequentially. And that\u2019s buoyed by both the partner with shop \u2013 partnership with Shopify, which is now generally available in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the verified merchant program. And we\u2019ve welcomed kind of both traditional omni-channel retailers, folks by Crate & Barrel, as well as lots of emerging brands, folks like May Trade. So that first part of the strategy is really about that. Then you asked specifically, are we getting traction with users? And we really measure that by building these new shopping surfaces. Some of the ones you mentioned shop from boards, shop from search. And look by the end of February, Pinners engaging with that shopping content had increased 44% and organic traffic to retailers has increased by more than 2x, about 2.3 times. And so we\u2019re really happy that Pinners are seeing more value and then advertisers and retailers are seeing that in the form of traffic. And then the last part of that story is really what ties together, the first part of your question about shopping with some of your second part of your question around more performance-based products. But we do see that shopping revenue is growing faster than the rest of the overall business mix. It\u2019s almost doubled year-over-year looking at Q1, and we\u2019re building a lot of things to continue to support that more performance-oriented and conversion-oriented mentality. That includes investments and things like measurement. We continue to look at tag integrations and tag integrations from third parties are up to 2x. That also means more automated products. And so, Todd mentioned that we provided tools and automatic bidding around traffic objectives. We\u2019re really excited in the future to bring that to our conversion or OCPM objectives as well. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re really allocating resources. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a huge divergence from our strategy, which has been about enabling more conversion like activity. But we\u2019re doubling down there, especially in the current environment.\nOperator: Your next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. I guess, two quick questions. How tied is the ad spend on Pinterest to events? Just wondering how you think about that? Obviously, you said it\u2019s mostly performance \u2013 a higher percentage performance base, but how does that correlate to events? And then I remember last year in 2Q, you had a nice acceleration around the IPO, which was in April and also a very robust Easter. So wondering if that\u2019s affecting your comps at all as you look at what you provided for April. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. So on that \u2013 the first question around ad spend tied to events. What I would say that we\u2019ve called out and continue to experience is something a little different perhaps than other platforms. But we \u2013 people plan well in advance of \u2013 you come with a planning mindset and commercial intend to Pinterest, often planning well in advance of an event or a seasonal moment. But I think your question is more about events that may be postponed in this environment than what we typically experience. And what I\u2019m referring to specifically are things like seasonal moments that we called out in Q4, Halloween, Thanksgiving, end-of-year holidays. We had a lot of strength through Q1 around events like New Year\u2019s Day, Valentine\u2019s Day, the big game, et cetera. And so while some of those seasonal moments can get delayed in this type of environment, or the shape of spending may be altered, many of them are driven by the calendar. There are moments that people plan for their personal and family lives. The second part of your question was around the Q2 dynamics that we called out last year. We really referenced two things that we thought led to some of the strengths that we saw last year when we accelerated or reaccelerated our revenue growth to 62% on a year-over-year basis. The first of those was Easter timing, and I may get the dates wrong. But I think a couple of years ago, Easter was on the 1st of April; last year, it was on the 21st of April; and this year, it was on the 12th. And so as the Easter moves around, back to the first part of my answer, Easter is a seasonal moment that many advertisers want to get in front of our users, as they\u2019re planning for that holiday event. And so because that holiday moves around, it has a different impact year-to-year on Q1 and Q2 performance. And last year, it was much heavier in Q2 than it was this year, for example. We called out a moment ago, I think, that\u2019s probably a point or two of a growth headwind that we\u2019re experiencing right now. So while we\u2019re down 8% in the month of April, there\u2019s probably a point or two that\u2019s related to Easter. There may be even more related to the IPO. But it was tougher to quantify that a year ago, and so we didn\u2019t want to do it here.\nJustin Post: Great. And maybe one follow-up. Just when I\u2019m at events, I mean, personal events like wedding planning or get-togethers around Easter, just wondering how that might be affecting advertising activity?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Well, I think the dollars follow people in their planning activities and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen mixed amounts of spend. To the extent, people are planning for how to home-school their kids, how to exercise in their home, how to teach themselves how to cook. Those are new events that we\u2019re seeing some spend deviate toward and away from things like wedding planning, travel events, et cetera. One of the things we\u2019ve seen over the course of the last several weeks has been referenced that engagement dipped a little bit as people were planning to shelter in place when all the news initially broke and then started to come back and we reached record levels, because folks were trying to train themselves how to operate in this new environment. And so for an advertiser like NordicTrack, that\u2019s a great thing. People are trying to figure out how to exercise in their home and there\u2019s a lot more spend opportunity for some brands like that relative to those that may be in the travel segment or around weddings and other events.\nJustin Post: Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Todd, kind of going back to the recent trends questions and the down eight, you called out involves a little bit of guesstimate on mix by month. But assuming March is bigger, it implies January and February grew about 44%. So does that number sound right? And then secondly, going back to the automatic bidding, as you roll that out for conversion objectives, how meaningful could that be? And maybe what percent of the business today is targeting conversion optimization? And how do we think about that improved performance from automated bidding ultimately translating into higher spend and budgets? Any \u2013 anything you could share there would be helpful?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. So on the math that you\u2019re doing, there are a number of factors involved and we saw \u2013 the growth was in the kind of low to mid-40s and it accelerated a little bit in February, because we had an extra day in February and then we saw the impact start to unfold early in March, but really take off in a material way in mid-March. And so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re too far off with your math and your assumptions. With respect to the impact on \u2013 of auto bidding on our conversion optimization product, I\u2019d say it\u2019s too early to know. We\u2019ve seen a positive impact on traffic objectives. We\u2019ve seen a significant increase in budget utilization, a significant uptick in number of clicks per budget and even click-through rate. But it\u2019s too early to tell, because we haven\u2019t yet rolled it out for conversion optimization. We are optimistic that it\u2019s the right thing to do and we\u2019ll deliver value to our advertising partners and help us with budget utilization. But until it\u2019s rolled out, we won\u2019t know much to share.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense and help us understand sort of the makeup of your performance advertisers a little bit better. Obviously, there\u2019s a broad spectrum of advertisers that are engaged in performance and a lot of gray area there. But if you could give us a sense of sort of what the spectrum looks like in terms of size, in terms of what you would consider to be performance advertisers that kind of fall into premium, the ones that have access to Pinterest salespeople and third-party measurement versus some that might fall into kind of more the \u2013 almost remnant category of performance advertisers. And particularly in this environment sort of where you\u2019re seeing maybe differentiation in the performance of those two categories, which \u2013 who is most active and where you\u2019re seeing returns fluctuate there?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Heath, I can take a cut out and Todd can chime in as well. Like that was really about the composition of the performance advertisers and how we\u2019re seeing that behave differently. So, as you know, we \u2013 we\u2019ve started off with a lot of large omni-channel retailers. So what I would say is that, on average, those folks have been the first to pause spend when they closed stores. And then when they do reactivate, we\u2019ve seen some folks reactivate. They tend to first reactivate their most performance objectives and are holding off on brand objectives in general. So they\u2019re really using on products like OCPM or traffic objectives, and they\u2019re driving a ton of kind of ROI accountability there. Then an effort that\u2019s been going on, on all year and will continue are, what I call, more mid-market advertisers. And those are folks where they\u2019re often very sophisticated advertisers, but they don\u2019t have a dedicated salesperson. So when we talk about some of the product investments that we\u2019ve made this year, last year was really about very small businesses, providing mobile interfaces. This year has really been about tools and automation to help those folks scale. And the example of automatic bidding that Todd provided is a pretty significant one. And the reason it\u2019s significant is, because not only do you get the benefits of efficiency that Todd mentioned, like Kiehl\u2019s was an example advertiser. They saw 47% increase in clicks with the same budget and a higher CTR. But it also means that they\u2019re doing a lot less work. So they don\u2019t need a dedicated salesperson to be managing their budgets. We don\u2019t have as many of what you would describe as remnant advertisers. But overall, performance objectives have grown faster, both because of the macroeconomic environment and kind of a return to performance. And the fact that when brand budgets exited, it decreased the cost per conversion. You had fewer people contending for those same convert objectives, so people can get more value. And we take that as actually a really good sign for where we want to take the business in the future.\nHeath Terry: Great. I guess, one follow-up to that is, when you look at the mix of your performance advertisers that are focused on are primarily buying sort of minimum bid advertising, maybe that\u2019s another way to think of kind of the remnant buyers that are out there. What percentage of your average \u2013 and I\u2019m not expecting you actually give a percentage. But when you look at the mix of your performance advertisers, how much would you say are sort of focused on that minimum bid inventory that\u2019s available there? And how have you seen that? As you\u2019ve been able to attract more premium performance advertisers over time, and I see my ad filled with ads for Apple TV, which I wouldn\u2019t have expected that would have been there a year ago for a variety of reasons. But when you see more premium performance advertisers coming into the mix, how would you say that, that has shifted away from those sort of minimum bid advertisers?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Yes. I mean, I think what I hear you getting at is like, how many folks have very, very low-cost per acquisition and can still make money and how many has higher ones? Everyone is actually minimum bid. It\u2019s the nature of an auction that no one wants to pay more than demand is. But look, as we grow the number of advertisers, there are more and more folks that have that ability to get a lot of lifetime value out of an acquisition. And so, we expect that, as you get more liquidity, that will increase prices over time, and our job is to provide as much value as possible. And so things like automatic bidding and other efforts to improve machine learning and targeting provide more efficiency for advertisers across the Board.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you very much. So I guess, one of the interesting disclosure points at the time of the preannouncement was that, there wasn\u2019t much in the way of travel-related sector revenue, despite what we have understood to be one of the main use cases for your users. So right now, the travel sectors lack of presence ended up being less of a headwind for you. But what has been holding these advertisers back until now? And what can you do to onboard them as we eventually recover from this crisis? And second, on the letter, you talk about hundreds of merchants lined up to join shopping. So from an operational standpoint, how long does it typically take to onboard and interested party into shopping and once they make the decision to start spending with Pinterest? Thank you.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Yes. Stephen, your first question was really about travel. And I think that the reason that travel hasn\u2019t been as large of a sector as it is a use case is, because the vast majority of travel is very focused on last click acquisition travel. So think Expedia advertising on Google and building a machine. I think that the way to unlock that is to do what we\u2019ve done for many verticals, which has showed the disproportionate value of catching people early in travel inspiration and planning and then bringing them down closer and closer to a transaction. I will say that when we look at our plans for increasing kind of purchasing activity on Pinterest travel is not the first place that we\u2019re optimizing for. We think there\u2019s a really big opportunity in a lot of our core shopping verticals, which is why shopping and conversion-driven events continues to be a focus. So think about things like home decor, apparel and general shopping, there\u2019s a huge opportunity to take people from getting ideas all the way down to find things, and that\u2019s really the thesis of a lot of the shopping efforts. Your second question is how much easier has it gotten for people to get on Board with the shopping program? And I would say that we\u2019re really proud of the progress. We\u2019re always trying to remove friction from that. But one evidence of this is that, we\u2019ve just seen a significant increase in the number of people that are uploading their catalogs, and we\u2019re also seeing benefit from third-party integrations. So I mentioned before that the Shopify partnership is now live in the U.S. and Canada. And that means that a midsized retailer that\u2019s using a platform like Shopify can get on Board, and they\u2019re not touching the code of their e-commerce site. It\u2019s an option that they can select, which gets the right measurement in place and get their catalog uploaded and put them in a position where they can begin advertising really easily. So there\u2019s always more work to do there and particularly for large advertisers. We not only have to make it technically easier, but we also have to wait for them to get out of complete shelter mode, where they may not be touching anything on their site, if they have a lot of their stores closed. But removing that friction and getting as many people seamlessly kind of uploaded through our catalog and through our first-party measurement is a long term strategic priority for the company.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go back to the performance on the discussion on performance-based advertising. So we\u2019ve seen some other ad businesses in the last week or two that are majority performance-based that have seen less of a slowdown in this environment. So just curious what your view is on why the variation in deltas? And do you think that\u2019s based on the verticals or categories in which your advertisers lie or perhaps just on the earlier stage nature and perhaps a smaller number of advertisers? Thanks.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Look, I think that, it has to do with the mix of advertisers that we\u2019ve got. And so, one, even performance-based advertisers are some verticals that are disproportionately impacted, as well as some larger kind of there \u2013 sorry, there are some verticals that are disproportionately impacted. And then depending on the size of the business, they may be impacted more or less by physical store closure. So part of the reason that we have a long-term strategy about increasing the numbers. So we\u2019re not relying on any particular size of advertiser or any particular vertical over time. But I think that you\u2019re going to see varying changes across the different advertising platforms driven a lot by this mix by the nature of advertising we have in place.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Levine with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Levine: Just another further question on the shopping feed side. When advertisers choose not to do so, not participate, because it feels like it\u2019s one of the key things you guys could do to close the loop. I mean, I\u2019m curious what the pushback is? I guess, I\u2019m a little bit intrigued by Google announcing their PLA program, and I\u2019m wondering if this is something you guys would be able to leverage greater people participating in just cataloguing their feed?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Yes. So the question I heard was, what\u2019s the objection that we hear most often? I think that that\u2019s changed over time. So initially, the objection was, how easy is it to get by catalog and measurement implemented? And as we\u2019ve improved on that, we\u2019ve brought on more and more of those retailers. I think that candidly, now for some of the larger advertisers and the larger retailers, it\u2019s just getting on their radar and giving them the time and space to do those integrations well. You got to remember a lot of the folks, especially the omni-channel folks, like they have all of their stores closed. And so they\u2019re not investing a lot of incremental time. But we take the Google expansion of PLAs to making them free as actually kind of a validation of a strategy we\u2019ve been pursing for a while, which is we want to welcome as much high-quality inventory and then connect that to people who are in a browsing state. And we think that the big player like Google, we can kind of ride that trend and continue to scale up the amount of inventory that\u2019s available.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nJane Penner: In that case, I think, we\u2019re ready to close the call, and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ben.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Yes. I just wanted to thank everyone again for taking the time to join us. We appreciate the questions and we look forward to continuing the conversation down the road. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Yes, sure. So, Ross, I heard a couple of questions in there. One was an update on what we're seeing into the early part of Q2 through April? And the second was a little bit more color on what we're seeing in terms of vertical impact? And I'll take those in turn. So first, on the revenue side through the course of April, we're still obviously in the middle of a highly uncertain environment, driven by COVID-19. And so what we wanted to do on this call was share what we know, what we've actually experienced rather than project things that we don't yet know because of the amount of uncertainty in the market. We had a very strong start to Q1 that persisted through January and February. But as we noted in the letter, we had a sharp deceleration in year-over-year growth trends that really started in earnest in mid-March. That sharp deceleration persisted through the latter half of March, and then we began to see stabilization in our revenue \u2013 year-over-year revenue growth in early April. That stabilization persisted through the course of the month and into early May. To quantify that a bit further, our revenue for the month of April on a year-over-year basis declined 8%. And what I want to note here is, as a reminder, if you remember the call from a year ago, around Q2, we talked about Easter timing. And a year ago in the month of April, Easter provided a little bit more than an extra week of benefit. So on a normalized basis, we're probably a point or two better than the 8% decline that we noted or experienced in the month of April. So that's the April trends point. On the vertical piece, the impact has been uneven across the verticals where we're in market. And that's not \u2013 shouldn't be too much of a surprise, because the impact of the pandemic has been relatively uneven across verticals as well. Our major verticals, CPG and retail, I'll pick those, I think, you highlighted those, it's two that you wanted a bit more color on. In the CPG space, things like food and beverage, health and beauty had relatively better demand in the early part of this crisis, because people were preparing to shelter in place in their homes. But even those advertisers began to experience supply chain difficulties that had various impacts on their appetite for spend. In retail, the impact was a bit more pronounced. You might imagine that omni-channel retail stores \u2013 or omni-channel retailers that had stores that were closed had a significant pullback on spend, whereas direct-to-consumer brands grew relatively faster. In fact, our direct-to-consumer advertising cohort grew significantly faster than the rest of the business. But those advertisers, as we've noted, historically, are not a huge part of our revenue mix. We've also noticed historically that some of the most impacted verticals, areas like travel, automotive and restaurants were significantly impacted, but those constitute relatively smaller exposure for us. So hopefully, that gets to your two points on recent revenue trends and some of the color around our vertical exposure. The only thing I would add there, just one extra point, and you didn't ask, Ross, but it's probably worth noting that we have these joint business partnerships that we sometimes sign with prospective advertisers. So these are not contracts to spend, but they're indications of intent to spend. And we saw the number of those deals grow over the course of Q1 this year relative to last year, and the dollars covered by those agreements more than doubled year-over-year. So that was a good indication of intent to spend across our advertising base and that trend has persisted even through April, where we've continued to sign some of those deals. So I wouldn't want to over-index on what that means, because none of those deals are a contractual obligation. But we're still very actively involved with major retailers and seeing good intent there. Great. So I don't know, Ben, if you want to talk a little bit about the new users and engagement, and I can take the second two on brand and performance and expense guidance. Yes, yes. So, Mark, the second couple of pieces of your question here. On the formats, what we've talked about in the past is that, we are a majority performance business and a minority brand/awareness business, just in terms of revenue contribution. And I'll go into a little bit more color there. But we've invested in a full funnel ads business. And the reason we've done that is because of the the mindset that our users bring. When our users come to Pinterest, they come with commercial intent. They're coming to plan something that they want to do in their real life and they go all the way from discovering an idea or being inspired ultimately, in many cases, to buying something. The second thing is worth noting is, advertisers tell us that their spend is ever more returns accountable. We know that advertising spend \u2013 the long-term trend in advertising is that, it's ever more ROI accountable. And so it's been very important for us as we invest in our ads product to build measurable value for conversion-oriented advertisers. We saw some trends around our conversion optimization and shopping products that grew much quicker than the rest of the business, reflecting the attributable conversion growth that we continue to see spike through the course of the quarter and into April, and we've been investing in that in three ways: our tools and automation, we rolled out, I think, we added in the letter that we had automated bidding for our traffic objectives, which improved click delivery on the same budget, which was an important innovation and one that will extend to further products as the year unfolds; more work on creative and formats: and against measurement, where we're showing more conversion activity against different attribution windows and better offline to online conversion matching. So that coupled with all the tag integration work that we've been talking about for sometime is leading to a stronger performance business. So going back to your question, we continue to be performance-heavy in terms of mix or the majority of our business is performance versus brand/awareness. And we saw significant improvements in our conversion optimization and shopping product formats over the course of the quarter. The automated \u2013 the bidding automation improvements that we made had a big impact on our traffic business as well, but that was in flux over the course of the quarter. So hopefully, that gets to your question on what we're seeing in formats. On the OpEx growth piece, I'll answer two questions. One, you didn't ask, but I think it'll probably come up. On the gross margin piece, I just wanted to remind folks that our cost of revenue for the business really is more tied to the number of users, the depth of their engagement and usage, along with product complexity. So this isn't \u2013 our cost of revenue doesn't scale with revenue, it scales with the number of users and their engagement. So we wanted to call out just to make sure there was no daylight between the way we're viewing our gross margin performance through the year in this odd market environment, where engagement trends are spiking at exactly the moment when the demand picture is more mixed. On the OpEx side, we continue to focus on and are excited about the long-term opportunity in front of us as a business. We believe in the potential of Pinterest and as a result of that, we're staying focused on the four big pillars of investment that we opened at the start of the year: investing in inspiring content, more use cases for our users, an improved shopping experience and diversifying our advertiser base. So we \u2013 we'll continue to invest in those things. And the reason we're investing in this environment is, one, we believe in the long-term potential of the business, we think that, that remains unchanged. We have the balance sheet to do it with $1.07 billion in cash and $500 million undrawn revolver. And we believe that in this market environment, retooling things like travel, event spending and marketing will allow us to dial back the growth of our investments prudently while we still invest in the core strategic pillars that will drive long-term value. So I don't know, Mark, if that gets to your \u2013 oh, yes, you also asked about non-GAAP versus GAAP. That was designed to be more of a non-GAAP comment. Yes. So on that \u2013 the first question around ad spend tied to events. What I would say that we've called out and continue to experience is something a little different perhaps than other platforms. But we \u2013 people plan well in advance of \u2013 you come with a planning mindset and commercial intend to Pinterest, often planning well in advance of an event or a seasonal moment. But I think your question is more about events that may be postponed in this environment than what we typically experience. And what I'm referring to specifically are things like seasonal moments that we called out in Q4, Halloween, Thanksgiving, end-of-year holidays. We had a lot of strength through Q1 around events like New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, the big game, et cetera. And so while some of those seasonal moments can get delayed in this type of environment, or the shape of spending may be altered, many of them are driven by the calendar. There are moments that people plan for their personal and family lives. The second part of your question was around the Q2 dynamics that we called out last year. We really referenced two things that we thought led to some of the strengths that we saw last year when we accelerated or reaccelerated our revenue growth to 62% on a year-over-year basis. The first of those was Easter timing, and I may get the dates wrong. But I think a couple of years ago, Easter was on the 1st of April; last year, it was on the 21st of April; and this year, it was on the 12th. And so as the Easter moves around, back to the first part of my answer, Easter is a seasonal moment that many advertisers want to get in front of our users, as they're planning for that holiday event. And so because that holiday moves around, it has a different impact year-to-year on Q1 and Q2 performance. And last year, it was much heavier in Q2 than it was this year, for example. We called out a moment ago, I think, that's probably a point or two of a growth headwind that we're experiencing right now. So while we're down 8% in the month of April, there's probably a point or two that's related to Easter. There may be even more related to the IPO. But it was tougher to quantify that a year ago, and so we didn't want to do it here. Well, I think the dollars follow people in their planning activities and that's why we've seen mixed amounts of spend. To the extent, people are planning for how to home-school their kids, how to exercise in their home, how to teach themselves how to cook. Those are new events that we're seeing some spend deviate toward and away from things like wedding planning, travel events, et cetera. One of the things we've seen over the course of the last several weeks has been referenced that engagement dipped a little bit as people were planning to shelter in place when all the news initially broke and then started to come back and we reached record levels, because folks were trying to train themselves how to operate in this new environment. And so for an advertiser like NordicTrack, that's a great thing. People are trying to figure out how to exercise in their home and there's a lot more spend opportunity for some brands like that relative to those that may be in the travel segment or around weddings and other events. Yes. So on the math that you're doing, there are a number of factors involved and we saw \u2013 the growth was in the kind of low to mid-40s and it accelerated a little bit in February, because we had an extra day in February and then we saw the impact start to unfold early in March, but really take off in a material way in mid-March. And so I don't think you're too far off with your math and your assumptions. With respect to the impact on \u2013 of auto bidding on our conversion optimization product, I'd say it's too early to know. We've seen a positive impact on traffic objectives. We've seen a significant increase in budget utilization, a significant uptick in number of clicks per budget and even click-through rate. But it's too early to tell, because we haven't yet rolled it out for conversion optimization. We are optimistic that it's the right thing to do and we'll deliver value to our advertising partners and help us with budget utilization. But until it's rolled out, we won't know much to share."

            "name": "Benjamin Silbermann",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, the world has changed a lot since we did our last call back in February. And on behalf of our entire company, I just want to thank all the heroes out there who are helping people through this tough time. Like every person in every business, we're figuring out how to manage and work through the current health and economic crisis, and that starts with making sure employees are safe and healthy. It also means ensuring that Pinterest is a valuable resource for people as they adjust to life in this new reality. Over the last month-and-a-half, we've learned that our mission of bringing everyone inspiration to their lives has never been more relevant than it is right now. Over the past weeks, we've seen record-high engagement from existing users, resurrected users and new users. Prior to COVID-19, we saw gains driven by product investments that are detailed in this quarter's and past shareholder letters. The stay-at-home orders that began in mid-March significantly accelerated this trend. When the COVID crisis began, we immediately prioritized the safety of our users by helping them find reliable health information during the pandemic. And as people start practical solutions for challenges created by the crisis, they discovered new ways to use Pinterest and also deepened their existing uses of services. They search for things like recipes for freezer-friendly meals, getting ideas for home-schooling, researching home gym equipment, or figuring out how to do haircuts from home. We're proud that Pinterest is helping people all over the world get through this difficult time. We're also working with advertisers as they adjust to this new economic climate. The quarter began with a continuation of the strength we've seen in Q4, but the pandemic began to impact our business during March. As offline stores closed around the world, many advertisers slowed or paused their advertising spending on Pinterest. For those advertisers that paused, we're sharing our insights to help them plan and eventually reaccelerate and reactivate their spend. Pinterest is where consumers have always looked for ideas and plan their lives, and we're offering CMOs valuable insights to help them decide how to spend their 2020 budgets. For those advertisers that continue to spend, we've seen a shift away from awareness campaigns and towards highly performant ads, an area we've invested heavily in over the past year. As a result, our conversion optimization ads and shopping ads are much bigger part of our product mix today than they were a year ago. These ads are delivering real value to marketers with ROI accountable objectives, particularly as Pinners engagement with shopping surfaces has increased significantly over the same period. Finally, while we're working to help Pinners and advertisers to this current crisis, we remain firmly committed to our long-term strategies. We continue to invest in our vision to be the home of the Internet's most inspiring content, to help users discover more ways to use Pinterest in their lives, to let Pinners easily purchase things they find on our surface and to create value for a much more diverse base of advertisers. We have the benefit of having a balance sheet that allows us to continue to pursue these outcomes. As you know, we withdrew annual guidance, because we have limited visibility to future advertiser demands. That remains the case, but Todd and I will continue to provide as much transparency into our current business as possible, as things evolve in the coming months. With that, we'll turn it over to Q&A. Brent, we're ready for our first question. Sure. Ross, why don't I start with your second question on engagement, and then Todd will talk about outlook in Q2 and some of what we're seeing in retail and CPG. So, as mentioned in the shareholder letter, when the pandemic first started, we saw an initial dip in engagement as people just got prepared, and then we saw a steadily rising engagement. We saw that across both brand-new users. So roughly, 50% of the engagement we saw were from people that were new to Pinterest. We also saw significant growth amongst existing users and resurrected users. So across all fronts, we saw really strong engagement. And we've talked in past calls about how we look at a basket of different metrics. Across all those metrics, we saw pretty significant increases. So, for example, searches were up more than 60% year-over-year. New board creations, which does indicate that people are using Pinterest for new use cases, were up 60% year-on-year. Pinner views on their own boards, that was also up 60%. And then we continue to see strong growth in the usage of video, which has been a longstanding trend. As we look forward into April, there are probably two aspects. First, we would expect overall for there to be a slowing of that growth just as people spend less time online. At the same time, the things that we typically look at, which are the indicators of sustained user engagement, things like people creating brand-new boards, doing searches across multiple use cases, those early indicators look really strong. So we do expect to retain some of that engagement, but not at the same rate. It's obviously an unprecedented situation. So we don't know exactly how that will mete out. But we've been really excited about the growth that we're seeing across the Board, and we want to make sure that we're continuing to serve those Pinners going forward. Todd, I can turn it over to you. Sure. So on new users, we continue to see really similar behavior across those new users. And so a lot of the reasons they were coming to Pinterest were things that were directly related to COVID-19. So things like meal preparation, making your home more livable, interested in things like home and garden. And so those topics look really similar. And as I mentioned earlier, the engagement trends from those folks looks promising, meaning that they're taking all of the actions that in the past had helped us predict whether a user would be a long-term user. Now, the situation is different. So we have to wait to see what that looks like. The other thing that's worth noting is that we continue to see strength from, especially younger users. So we've mentioned this in the last call, but we're seeing really rapid growth in the population of users that are under 25, which we take as a positive sign, because it's an indication that we're kind of expanding into a new demographic. Todd, you want to talk about the performance mix and OpEx? Sure. I guess, to start it on the shopping, we've outlined in past calls that we kind of have a three-part shopping strategy. And so the first is that we want to continue to grow high-quality inventory, and we have two projects against that, our catalog uploader, and we've been really excited. We've seen catalog uploads increase about 140% sequentially. And that's buoyed by both the partner with shop \u2013 partnership with Shopify, which is now generally available in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the verified merchant program. And we've welcomed kind of both traditional omni-channel retailers, folks by Crate & Barrel, as well as lots of emerging brands, folks like May Trade. So that first part of the strategy is really about that. Then you asked specifically, are we getting traction with users? And we really measure that by building these new shopping surfaces. Some of the ones you mentioned shop from boards, shop from search. And look by the end of February, Pinners engaging with that shopping content had increased 44% and organic traffic to retailers has increased by more than 2x, about 2.3 times. And so we're really happy that Pinners are seeing more value and then advertisers and retailers are seeing that in the form of traffic. And then the last part of that story is really what ties together, the first part of your question about shopping with some of your second part of your question around more performance-based products. But we do see that shopping revenue is growing faster than the rest of the overall business mix. It's almost doubled year-over-year looking at Q1, and we're building a lot of things to continue to support that more performance-oriented and conversion-oriented mentality. That includes investments and things like measurement. We continue to look at tag integrations and tag integrations from third parties are up to 2x. That also means more automated products. And so, Todd mentioned that we provided tools and automatic bidding around traffic objectives. We're really excited in the future to bring that to our conversion or OCPM objectives as well. And so that's how we're really allocating resources. I wouldn't say that's a huge divergence from our strategy, which has been about enabling more conversion like activity. But we're doubling down there, especially in the current environment. Heath, I can take a cut out and Todd can chime in as well. Like that was really about the composition of the performance advertisers and how we're seeing that behave differently. So, as you know, we \u2013 we've started off with a lot of large omni-channel retailers. So what I would say is that, on average, those folks have been the first to pause spend when they closed stores. And then when they do reactivate, we've seen some folks reactivate. They tend to first reactivate their most performance objectives and are holding off on brand objectives in general. So they're really using on products like OCPM or traffic objectives, and they're driving a ton of kind of ROI accountability there. Then an effort that's been going on, on all year and will continue are, what I call, more mid-market advertisers. And those are folks where they're often very sophisticated advertisers, but they don't have a dedicated salesperson. So when we talk about some of the product investments that we've made this year, last year was really about very small businesses, providing mobile interfaces. This year has really been about tools and automation to help those folks scale. And the example of automatic bidding that Todd provided is a pretty significant one. And the reason it's significant is, because not only do you get the benefits of efficiency that Todd mentioned, like Kiehl's was an example advertiser. They saw 47% increase in clicks with the same budget and a higher CTR. But it also means that they're doing a lot less work. So they don't need a dedicated salesperson to be managing their budgets. We don't have as many of what you would describe as remnant advertisers. But overall, performance objectives have grown faster, both because of the macroeconomic environment and kind of a return to performance. And the fact that when brand budgets exited, it decreased the cost per conversion. You had fewer people contending for those same convert objectives, so people can get more value. And we take that as actually a really good sign for where we want to take the business in the future. Yes. I mean, I think what I hear you getting at is like, how many folks have very, very low-cost per acquisition and can still make money and how many has higher ones? Everyone is actually minimum bid. It's the nature of an auction that no one wants to pay more than demand is. But look, as we grow the number of advertisers, there are more and more folks that have that ability to get a lot of lifetime value out of an acquisition. And so, we expect that, as you get more liquidity, that will increase prices over time, and our job is to provide as much value as possible. And so things like automatic bidding and other efforts to improve machine learning and targeting provide more efficiency for advertisers across the Board. Yes. Stephen, your first question was really about travel. And I think that the reason that travel hasn't been as large of a sector as it is a use case is, because the vast majority of travel is very focused on last click acquisition travel. So think Expedia advertising on Google and building a machine. I think that the way to unlock that is to do what we've done for many verticals, which has showed the disproportionate value of catching people early in travel inspiration and planning and then bringing them down closer and closer to a transaction. I will say that when we look at our plans for increasing kind of purchasing activity on Pinterest travel is not the first place that we're optimizing for. We think there's a really big opportunity in a lot of our core shopping verticals, which is why shopping and conversion-driven events continues to be a focus. So think about things like home decor, apparel and general shopping, there's a huge opportunity to take people from getting ideas all the way down to find things, and that's really the thesis of a lot of the shopping efforts. Your second question is how much easier has it gotten for people to get on Board with the shopping program? And I would say that we're really proud of the progress. We're always trying to remove friction from that. But one evidence of this is that, we've just seen a significant increase in the number of people that are uploading their catalogs, and we're also seeing benefit from third-party integrations. So I mentioned before that the Shopify partnership is now live in the U.S. and Canada. And that means that a midsized retailer that's using a platform like Shopify can get on Board, and they're not touching the code of their e-commerce site. It's an option that they can select, which gets the right measurement in place and get their catalog uploaded and put them in a position where they can begin advertising really easily. So there's always more work to do there and particularly for large advertisers. We not only have to make it technically easier, but we also have to wait for them to get out of complete shelter mode, where they may not be touching anything on their site, if they have a lot of their stores closed. But removing that friction and getting as many people seamlessly kind of uploaded through our catalog and through our first-party measurement is a long term strategic priority for the company. Look, I think that, it has to do with the mix of advertisers that we've got. And so, one, even performance-based advertisers are some verticals that are disproportionately impacted, as well as some larger kind of there \u2013 sorry, there are some verticals that are disproportionately impacted. And then depending on the size of the business, they may be impacted more or less by physical store closure. So part of the reason that we have a long-term strategy about increasing the numbers. So we're not relying on any particular size of advertiser or any particular vertical over time. But I think that you're going to see varying changes across the different advertising platforms driven a lot by this mix by the nature of advertising we have in place. Yes. So the question I heard was, what's the objection that we hear most often? I think that that's changed over time. So initially, the objection was, how easy is it to get by catalog and measurement implemented? And as we've improved on that, we've brought on more and more of those retailers. I think that candidly, now for some of the larger advertisers and the larger retailers, it's just getting on their radar and giving them the time and space to do those integrations well. You got to remember a lot of the folks, especially the omni-channel folks, like they have all of their stores closed. And so they're not investing a lot of incremental time. But we take the Google expansion of PLAs to making them free as actually kind of a validation of a strategy we've been pursing for a while, which is we want to welcome as much high-quality inventory and then connect that to people who are in a browsing state. And we think that the big player like Google, we can kind of ride that trend and continue to scale up the amount of inventory that's available. Yes. I just wanted to thank everyone again for taking the time to join us. We appreciate the questions and we look forward to continuing the conversation down the road. Have a good day."

And I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I'm now going to hand over to Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Neil, please go ahead.\nNeil Doshi: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest's earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. I'm Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, Pinterest's President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations. Now I'll cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q1 2022 and beyond are preliminary and are not an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today. And we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Neil. And hi, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. 2021 was an important year for Pinterest. We remain laser-focused on helping everyone get inspiration for their lives and building a dedicated space online to plan and create their features. We believe that the demand for a positive place to play in near future will only continue to grow over the long-term. That's why we spent the past year investing heavily in evolving how we inspire Pinners by building a new publishing platform for creators. We believe that when we connect Pinners, not just with great ideas but also with the great creators behind them, enrich new formats like short form video, the overall experience is more inspirational. And when people are more inspired, they do more planning and shopping. Advertisers are able to reach consumers with more intent. And that, in turn, drives more value for Pinterest. In 2021, we made our publishing tools available in 37 markets and launched 150 new features, many of which were released in October. So it's still very early, but we're already seeing signs of promise specifically a rise in session frequency and time spent from people who followed multiple creators. This supports our hypothesis that our investments in native content can be engagement accretive over time. We believe that with sustained investment will see these trends grow as more and more Pinners find and follow creators they love. We know we're building this new platform in a challenging environment. In Q4, we saw monthly active users decreased 6% year-over-year to 431 million. This was primarily due to the continued unwinding of the pandemic, lower traffic coming from search and increasing competition for user attention. We're clear eyed about these recent headwinds, and we believe that over the long term, our new publishing platform will deep engagement by Pinners. We're also continuing to improve the core experience to help surface the most relevant content at the right time. With shopping, we're building a more dedicated experience to help people discover and buy what they love as well as expanding our test of seamless checkout. We're also working to improve the advertiser experience. Helping them optimize their budgets and more effectively measure performance with the changing privacy landscape. And we're working to build on the business milestones we achieved in 2021, where we surpassed $2 billion in revenue for the year growing revenue 52% over the previous year. We also posted our first full year of GAAP profitability. Our aspiration is to build an end-to-end platform that gives people great inspiration and the tools to buy, to make and to do those ideas for their lives. All in the space that's both positive and encouraging. We believe that the world needs this. And that's why we're increasing our investment to build it. And I'm confident that our team is up to the task. So now I'll turn it over to Todd who will share more.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for the first quarter of 2022. We were pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $847 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%. While most of the details about our financial performance in our shareholder letter, I'd like to provide some additional color. Strength in the quarter came from large retailers, midsized and managed small advertisers and international markets. This was offset by muted demand from CPG advertisers who continue to face pressure from supply chain issues. Furthermore, with the continued distribution and placement of Idea Pins during the quarter, we estimate that the negative impact to our fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, similar to the third quarter. This impact was factored into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I wanted to take a couple of minutes to discuss fourth quarter engagement, particularly in the U.S. Our U.S. monthly active users declined 12% year-over-year to $86 million, primarily due to pandemic easing relative to the year ago quarter. We also believe that time spent on competing video app platforms contributed to the year-on-year declines. Furthermore, our monthly active users were negatively impacted from lower search traffic due to Google's November algorithm updates. In fact, more than half of the Q3 to Q4 sequential decline in U.S. monthly active users was attributable to Google's algorithm update starting in mid-November. We're examining the overall impact from recent search algorithm changes as it appears to be more persistent than we've seen historically. Our teams are working diligently to understand this, but it may take some time. Looking at users by platform, U.S. monthly active users coming to Pinterest from the web, desktop and mobile web declined around 30% year-over-year while U.S. monthly active users coming to Pinterest from mobile apps who account for a significant majority of our impressions and our revenue declined around 6% year-over-year. We're taking a number of steps to increase engagement on Pinterest. First, we're investing in native video content in a creator led content ecosystem. In the long run, we believe that this can be engagement and revenue accretive. As Ben mentioned, the early data make us cautiously optimistic. But bending the curve on overall engagement will require us to scale this effort with sustained execution over several quarters. In the near term, we plan to invest in our core discovery and planning engines to provide our users with a richer even more personalized experience across our various surfaces. We plan to apply more data and larger models to our sophisticated machine learning stack to help with content recommendations, home feed personalization and an improved search experience for existing, previous and new users who come to Pinterest. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q1. In my remarks last quarter, I noted that engagement trends on Pinterest had not yet returned to pre-pandemic norms, specifically to the mix of at-home versus out-of-home use cases that we saw in 2019. In Q4, these trends began to normalize. For example, the propensity of Pinners to adopt use cases like home decor or cooking in the fourth quarter of 2021 was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019. As we revert to our pre-pandemic use case mix, we expect that the pandemic unwind will be a less meaningful engagement headwind as we move through 2022, particularly after mid-March when we will lap the widespread easing of lockdown restrictions. That said, engagement headwinds from search algorithm changes and from time spent on competing platforms are more persistent and could potentially disrupt normal seasonal trends. Given this context, we think it's most helpful to tell you what we know today. As of Tuesday, February 1, U.S. monthly active users were approximately $86.6 million and global monthly active users were approximately $436.8 million. On the revenue side, we expect Q1 revenue to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q1 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, the macro environment remains challenging for our CPG advertisers who are still dealing with supply chain and other macroeconomic issues. We believe this headwind could persist for a few quarters. Second, we continue to monitor the impact that higher CPAs could have on our more price-sensitive advertisers. There are some exogenous factors that appear to be resulting in higher CPAs, including overall demand for digital ads from advertisers. On Pinterest, specifically, if engagement declines continue, we could eventually expect to see some constraints on our monetizable supply and in turn, higher CPAs. This supply constraint is not something that we're seeing today, but we're monitoring it carefully. At the same time, we're investing in a number of opportunities to monetize our existing supply and to help advertisers achieve their goals. Third, our investment in Idea Pins and native video content will likely be a modest headwind to revenue in future quarters as it was in Q4. However, we believe that Idea Pins will be both engagement and revenue accretive over time. Finally, I want to touch on expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 27% year-over-year. This year, we plan to accelerate our investments in the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, shopping, our Pinner experience and advertiser success. We expect our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow around 10% quarter-over-quarter sequentially, as we continue to scale our investments in our native content ecosystem, our core Pinner experience and headcount across research and development and sales and marketing. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow around 40% year-over-year. The sequencing of that spend may change from quarter-to-quarter, but we'd suggest you look at the quarterly growth cadence in 2021 as a likely template. Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross, the line is yours.\nRoss Sandler: Hey. Ben, there's not really a nice way to ask this, so I'll just kind of ask it anyway. But there's been some recent press reports that pointed to a number of senior executives leaving the company recently. So can you just comment on what's going on with that? Is that not accurate? And how you feel about the senior management ranks as we look at your agenda in '22? And then you guys said that you Watch tab is one of the fastest growing products in history. So any way to just put some numbers around how big this could be in '22? Is it still a little too early? Or are you expecting this to be a needle mover in terms of engagement? Thanks a lot.\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Ross. I'll take a few questions in turn. So first of all, taking a step back, a lot of people are coming out of the pandemic, and they're reassessing their careers. And so along with many companies, we see what some people are calling a great employee reshuffle. But based on conversations with some of our peers, we believe that our attrition rate is roughly in line with others. I'd also remind everyone that we've been hiring pretty aggressively. We grew our headcount by 27% over the last year. The tech is covered, our tech press has covered some recent departures and many of the folks in articles that were named are people that joined pre-IPO several years ago. They joined a relatively small private company. They made an incredible contribution. I'm grateful for what they've done. And I'm excited for a lot of them to take their next step in bigger roles at smaller companies or in some cases, changing industries entirely. I'd also say that we just have an amazing bench of talent here at Pinterest. And this provides our existing employees that you have to take on more responsibility and to step in the new leadership roles, which we're just thrilled about. Finally, we've been able to welcome some great senior talent in new areas where we're making investments, including shopping and content. So that's kind of the story there. Your second question is about the Watch tab. What I'd say is that we're not breaking out engagement by surface just yet, but we're really optimistic even though it's early days on the creative effort in general and in the Watch tab specifically. And I would just remind folks why we're making the investment and why we're excited about it. The first reason we're making an investment really comes down to the core value proposition on Pinterest, which is to provide inspiration. And we think short form video and connecting people real creators is just an enormous opportunity to advance that vision in new ways. Short from video is being adopted all over the industry. But today, what we see from most of our competitors is that the innovation on short form video has been focused on entertainment, while Pinterest is more focused on providing, inspiring and useful experiences that can help people get ideas and then actually realize them by making, by buying or by doing something in real life. The second reason that we're excited is we think that over time, the creators' effort can increase both time spent on the platform, but also the frequency with which people visit. People often come to Pinterest when something is going on in their life. They might want to remodel their home, they might want to take on a new life project or plan a trip. And that's fantastic, but the engagement tends to be more periodic. If you look at a lot of the largest platforms in the world, they are either social networks with a strong messaging component, which pulls you back or they have some sort of published subscribed mechanism between creators and their audiences. And up until late last year, Pinterest had neither. It was really buoyed by the utility of the platform. We think by connecting people to inspiring creators who can share their passions and their ideas every day. Over the long-term, that can shift. So we're in really early days, but we're excited about both improving the core experience for users and the net impact will have on the business\nNeil Doshi: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric, the line is yours?\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking questions. Maybe two, if I can. As we exit '21, I'd love to look back and reflect on some of the learnings you had from some of the international expansion efforts, both on the investment side and building out versus what you've seen as monetization has started to come through in some of those international markets. And then the release, you talked a little bit about some of the markets you're expanding into in '22. Can we again frame it in terms of like what some of those investments might be versus what you see as some of the market opportunities, especially in a market the size of Japan? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. It's a great question because we're obviously one of the biggest growth drivers and clearest opportunities for us to continue the momentum we've had with our great traction with revenue performance is through international markets. I think the thing that we - it starts with building a great team. We have some tremendous country leaders. We have some great sales leadership, and I'm really excited about the folks that we brought on board. We've had a lot of hiring over the last year. And we've just done a great job of bringing the right people into Pinterest with the right leadership team. So that's one. More broadly, we often get the question why weren't we monetizing internationally quicker? And part of the reason was we wanted to get the user experience and the advertising experience right, both for our Pinners and to make sure we are delivering great results to our advertisers when we started to monetize internationally. And that's what we've done. We've proven that our full funnel advertising platform works in the U.S. We've built the right ad tech stack against that. We have the right go-to-market model and the right coverage model that we've built out in the U.S. And what we've been able to do internationally is start to replicate the same trends. There's a lot of learning and a lot of education and sales that needs to happen because of the nature of this platform. What we found - and you've asked questions in the past about which kinds of advertisers find success on Pinterest? What we've learned is that those that value being on an inspiration-driven platform, one that is brand safe, advertisers that value unique insights in the commercial mindset of users long before they buy something and who are open, therefore, to longer attribution windows. Those are the advertisers that find success. And so we're seeing that same playbook, which takes a little longer to unfold to build those relationships, generate that kind of understanding in the advertising community. But when it pays off, it's paying off with great traction and great growth in those markets that we've opened, most notably in Western Europe. You asked the question about 2022. In terms of growth, we're opening up in a couple more countries in Latin America. So Colombia, Chile and Argentina will open this year. So extending the reach within Latin America. And then as you mentioned, we're really excited to start monetizing in a very deep ad market in APAC in Japan. So all of that work is on track. And I would expect us to continue to see some contribution from those markets by the end of this year, but it takes time. And reflecting on your question, we opened Latin America last year. And while we've seen some early contribution. We've got a long way to go. And I think that's exciting for the future growth potential of the company.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thanks for the color.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. I'll just ask about MAUs or the monthly active users. And I know you've talked about this a little bit before, but just please double click on it. What's going to cause North American MAUs to stabilize and then to start growing again? Like what series of steps are you going to be looking for in order to gain conviction that you'll be able to get back to kind of that reasonable growth you had pre-COVID and then the COVID rise and fall? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yeah, Mark, I don't know if - I'm happy to start, and then Ben can weigh in a little bit on the product work that we're doing. I think the short answer to your question is - we're investing in our short form video content creator led content, native content ecosystem to address exactly that point. And we think that's the path toward enriching the user experience and building connections to shopping experiences overtime that will drive frequency of use, more people to the platform and overtime, a connection to shopping and commercial activity that will differentiate the platform, both with respect to users and advertisers. So that's the overall longer term answer. We're also focused on making the user experience more rewarding this year by leveraging the data we have, increasing personalization improving our recommendation engine. So continuing a lot of the things that we've talked about over the last couple of years to further build out a really rewarding user experience. And I think that will drive more people to the platform for more things in their life, more session frequency and ultimately, more conversions and economic activity. I don't know if it came through clearly before. But in terms of stability, we're looking at a couple of things. One is - last quarter, we talked a lot about the pandemic impact. We had the benefit of the pandemic from an engagement standpoint, when folks lock down, we shifted - user behavior shifted to more at-home use cases versus out-of-home use cases. And because of our strength and use cases associated with out of home activities, we benefited. That reversed last year in the spring when out-of-home use cases became more prevalent. And we saw the unwinding of some of those engagement gains in user growth. We, from Q3 to Q4, did see a large impact globally and in the U.S. from the search algorithm changes from Google. And so sequential growth, the bulk of that decline Q3 to Q4 was not pandemic related. It was more related to search algorithm changes that drove less search-related traffic to Pinterest. If you stripped out the impact of that, we were actually up in terms of direct mobile app users globally in the high single digits year-over-year. Internationally, we were up 11%. In the U.S., we were down around 6%. So much more resilient engagement with respect to the users who are the deepest, most dedicated resilient users who drive the bulk of our impressions, time spent and revenue. I don't know if that's helpful. Ben, I don't know if you want to pile on with respect to the investments we're making in product?\nBen Silbermann: Todd, I thought you did a great job giving an overview. Mark, the only thing I would add is we've talked about kind of three different kind of investments that we're making: Investment in creators; an investment in shopping. So when people see things, they can buy them; and then, of course, the investment in our core personalization and discovery experiences. But if you take a step back as a user like our aspiration is to build 1 coherent experience where all 3 of those things play an important role. Today, there are places to connect with your friends, there are places to be entertained. But our vision is to build kind of an inspiration to realization platform where you visit. You connect with traders that are aligned with your interests. We understand your taste and we recommend individual products, and then you can eventually buy those things directly. And that end-to-end experience is something that doesn't exist online. So these three investments will play out over time. I would say the creators is the earliest. Most of those features just launched in October, but it adds an important new element. This year, we'll continue to improve our shopping experiences. We'll expand our test to native checkout. We'll build more dedicated and personalized services on top of a shopping API. And then we're always investing into that core personalization and relevance. And that's really been buoyed by advances in machine learning and computer vision, which are core competencies for the company. So Pinterest is really charting a different course. I know in these calls, everything gets reduced down into time spend and ads. And those are, of course fundamental things that we look at all the time. But we're really focused on owning this inspiration to realization space in the market. We think that's very differentiated from social networks and from pure entertainment platforms. And the three investments that Todd mentioned on creators, shopping and personalization are all driving towards that common vision.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Sure. Thanks for taking my question. Let me ask one about sort of the investment areas on the advertising or the monetization side. I mean I know you typically have a pretty robust pipeline of types of innovation that you're focused on to deliver more return for your advertisers. As you look into what are the products or areas, Ben, where maybe you're most excited to really invest in and roll out that you think can really move the revenue you and also really deliver more return for your advertisers throughout 2022?\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Brian. I'll talk about four kind of themes that our advertising and shopping teams keep in mind. And then I'll go into them in a little bit more detail: And the first one we talked about before, is automation. So we're going to continue our automation journey, especially automating ad campaign management. The second is going to be relevant and optimization. Third, which Todd touched on, was international expansion. And then finally, shopping. And I'll just like walk through them individually. And I think together, they'll give you some more color on the journey that we're on. So look, just starting with automation. We still believe that we have a lot of runway as we automate ad campaign management. I mean our goal has always been that an advertiser should be able to show up with their budget, their goals and their content and Pinterest should take care of the rest. And we're still pretty far away from doing that. So in the past, you heard us talking about bidding automation. But this year, our investments are really directly linked to providing more value to midsized and small advertisers that are natural fit for Pinterest. And so that should result in increasing the efficiency of our ad marketplace and delivering greater value. Second is relevance. This is sort of this thing that never stops, but we really believe we have room to improve our relevance engines which should further improve the efficiency of our ads. Again, underlying that is leveraging our taste graph and leveraging machine learning. So when people see ads, they feel just like content. Third, we talked a little bit about international. Like I said, Todd did a great job of covering that we're expanding to new markets. And I'm really excited that the team that we built there and the playbook that we've developed over the last few years, we're kind of learning with each subsequent market how to get off our feet a little bit quicker. And then finally, when we look across all of our services. We know that the shopping surface in particular, the surface with the highest commercial intent still has huge headroom for monetization. So we're investing in building that great consumer experience first. But we see year-over-year increases in the number of people doing product searches, the amount of time that they're spending on shopping surfaces. And we're also simplifying our shopping ad formats so brands can just more easily promote their products. So there's a lot there. We'll be experimenting with Idea Pins monetization. We expect that to lag. We're going to wait for that creative economy to sort of get off speed. But we think there are some pretty significant drivers of future revenue growth that we're still in the early innings of pursuing.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Rich, the line is yours.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Like last year, there was obviously a lot of speculation surrounding Salesforce acquiring, you are looking to acquire. I guess the question is, especially when you sort of highlight Ben, the challenges of platform changes and how tweaks, I guess you're looking at what happened with iOS 14, 15 and Meta looking at sort of the way Google continue their algorithm. I guess it all just sort of begs the question is size and scale look increasingly important in the broader media tech ecosystem. And I guess even commerce ecosystem, I would say. How do you think about sort of where Pinterest fits in? Are you open to consolidation? Like how do you think about sort of where ultimately you need to be to accomplish what you want?\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Rich. Well, I think there are two parts to the answer. First, like as CEO and fiduciary, I'm always keeping an open mind. But I really do believe that we have a pretty unique place in the market. And I touched on it before, but I can go into a little bit more detail. First, there is a huge audience is coming to Pinterest for something that's fundamentally different than what they come to other platforms. They're not coming to connect with her friends. They're actually coming to envision their future and to plan for it. And increasingly, we're getting better and better at helping them do that planning, at connecting to the people that can share the knowledge and the inspiration to advance that, and then eventually comes into the retailers into the individual products they need. I really think that planning your future, that's a fundamental human need. That's not going away. And we're laser-focused on targeting that need above all the other ones. The second thing I'd say is that Pinterest sits at this pretty interesting intersection of a few trends that are really secular growth trends in the industry. Commerce is one of those. And we have a lot of people coming with specific intent to do something, but it may not settle on specific product they are for. And I think that's base of shopping not just buying, but actually shopping, discovering what you're looking for, finding some of the lines of your taste, that's still quite open. And then finally, we're investing in creator ecosystem and online video. And I truly believe that video and mobile video, it's still in its infancy as an industry. I believe that we're going to see verticalization happen over time. And we're well positioned to pioneer in a new media format to do both inspiration but also to allow creators to facilitate action in providing different revenue models for them and being a real source of economic growth for that new creator business. And so what we've laid out over the last few years - yeah?\nRich Greenfield: So just to be clear, when I think Todd made a comment about the potential risk to growth on sort of engagement tied to competition. I mean, are we speaking specifically about TikTok? Or is there something else beyond something like TikTok that you're looking at competitively that could have impact in the future?\nBen Silbermann: Sure, Rich. I mean, look, we take all competition seriously. I would argue that competition for kind of user attention and time right now is probably the most competitive industry in the world. So of course, TikTok we think about. We think about Meta. We think about Google. But we also really try to focus on what we can offer that's differentiated. And that was the spirit of the last answer. So I hope that's helpful.\nRich Greenfield: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Doug, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. It's Steve on for Doug, thanks for taking our questions. To the first one, do you have any views to share why Google algorithm changes are impacting you guys more [indiscernible] and how to think about direct traffic mix this share advertising going forward. And then secondly, could you give us an update on where you are and so maybe checkout and the timing for that will be beyond just that space?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yeah. I think a couple of questions in there. One was around the direct traffic and search-driven traffic. And then the other was on native checkout. On the second, we just started piloting and testing native checkout. And we look forward to continuing to scale and broaden those efforts over the course of the year. So it's still pretty early days. On the direct traffic mix, I tried to lay out a couple of ways I've been thinking about it. One was the bridge on sequential and year-over-year trends with respect to MAUs. And I wanted to give you a little bit more color on that direct usage, mobile app usage to give some color on the difference between search-driven traffic and search-driven MAUs versus those that are direct for the reason that you described. The truth is that Google makes algorithm changes regularly. We did see another one in November that had a material impact, which is why we're calling it out. It's not the first time it's happened. And we are working on how to best factor that into our product mix and respond to it. But the long-term answer is to have a robust native content ecosystem, which we're building, and I think that will be the long-term answer on engagement.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin, please go ahead.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two for me as well. I guess, first off, I wanted to follow up on some of the disparity and performance between the mobile app and desktop. I know you - a lot of the work you've done on personalization and native content, for example, might be more concentrated in the app. If that's true, is the app usage and engagement level or trend. Is that a better gage for what overall, the platform might look like down the road in terms of engagement. And then secondly, I know you've added a Chief Content Officer from YouTube. I think Malik's experience was for the lot of premium content and native content creation. So I'm wondering if YouTube's strategy in those areas serves us somewhat of a come play for what you hope to achieve with respect to video brought on to the platform? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Colin, why don't I start with the question on the search-driven traffic? And then I'll let Ben talk about the team and leadership piece. We've talked - remember back to our - when we were marketing the company on the road show, we talked about a lot of our user growth being different on Pinterest versus social media. It's not a viral product where if you join, you immediately invite seven of your friends. Much more linear in terms of growth, and it's driven largely by word of mouth. Search-driven traffic is kind of a way of getting word of mouth but it's automated. You're looking for a new idea, you have content that's recommended to you and you discover Pinterest. So it's an important top of funnel growth driver and it's also an important revisitation driver. For those reasons, we think it's an important part of our engagement because it's a source of revisitation and therefore, reducing churn. Ultimately, our MAUs are a byproduct of that. And it introduces people to Pinterest potentially for the first time to solve new problems in their life. I wanted to give the color on the mobile app uses because that is where people spend the bulk of their time impressions and revenue opportunity. But the two are very important when considered together. So that's why we've broken it out the way we did.\nBen Silbermann: Yes, Colin. And as you pointed out, we welcomed Malik from YouTube. He's our first Chief Content Officer, it kind of reflects the role and the importance of content on the platform going forward. Look, I would say there are a few things. One is, as a company, we have a lot to learn about audience development. We're really impressed with kind of at least analytical problem solving as well as experience in both kind of premium and user-generated content. The other thing that I was really interested in is that Pinterest really wants to be a place where the content that we serve to folks is nourishing, is positive and it's inspirational. I think over the last few years, a lot of our users have appreciated that while many services online kind of have quite a bit of polarization or toxicity or sometimes content that they don't feel like is enriching. Pinterest has tried to have a little bit of a tighter focus on something that's positive and inspiring. And that's because that's core to our mission, right? If you're thinking about being inspired for your life, it's important that you're in an environment on where the content is positive overall. And so looking at some of his experience working with more positive content ecosystems, whether it's like YouTube Kids or on the premium side, I thought brought some really important insight. I'd also share that we're building a whole team. And so there's always a lot of attention on leaders, but I'm excited about the team's ability to move fast and innovate and really chart its own path. Because I think that all of these content platforms while in their initial days, they may look similar. They're going to end up looking different and verticalizing. And so we're going to need to really follow kind of the Pinterest users and develop a content offering that really works towards our mission of inspiring them in their day-to-day life.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Lloyd, please go ahead.\nAakash Agarwal: Hi. This is Akash Agarwal on for Lloyd. Two questions, if I may. The first is, can you talk about trends in higher frequency metrics like weekly active users or maybe overall time spent? Are you seeing this outperform relative to MAU? And then the second question would just be, you mentioned how some of the newer formats are driving increases in frequency. What are you seeing with respect to shopping in particular? Are you seeing consumers who leverage the shopping functionality actually come back with greater frequencies? Or is it more story, Pins - Idea Pins and video? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: I can start. Thanks for the questions. So on the additional metrics that you were asking about, weekly active users, time spent, et cetera. We do disclose a ratio in our public filings on an annual basis around weekly active users as a percentage of monthly active users, and that's been pretty stable over the last few years. So that's the answer on one. With respect to shopping we are seeing a much better user experience, enabled by a lot of the investments we've been making over the last few years, dedicated shopping surfaces that allow users to go from idea to purchase in a much more natural kind of shopping in a much more natural shopping journey. And at the same time, we've dramatically improved the amount of inventory we can serve with our catalog ingestion work and the APIs that we've developed. As a result of that, we've seen a number of users who are engaging in shopping surfaces grow pretty meaningfully. We're up 20% sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and 20% year-over-year. So really encouraging. And I think there are a lot of connections that we can build over the next few years across this native video ecosystem, our creator-led content ecosystem coupled with a lot of the shopping investments we're making should make a really differentiated experience on Pinterest. You may have also noted that we got some press a couple of days ago on the AR, some of the AR products we've been shipping that have really improved from a technology perspective, our ability to deliver pretty interesting shopping experiences. So really excited about some of the innovation that our teams have built.\nAakash Agarwal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin, please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. I'll ask just one. Revenues really accelerated during the pandemic, and you were able to reach 32% margins for EBITDA last year. So just looks like you're going to be doing some more investing next year. What have you learned about the margin potential of the business? And any update on how you're thinking about long-term margins? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Justin. Well, we did have kind of a banner year with respect to performance. We - gross margins were at incredibly high levels. By the end of the year, our spend profile, we continue to invest aggressively. Our headcount growth, I think a year ago, it was like 15% in the fourth quarter. That ticked up a few points every quarter until we got to 27% in the fourth quarter of this year. We're investing in a lot further - more head count growth going into next year. I think what we've proven is that we have a great business model and that the business is working. I think we've also internally come to the view that the long-term potential of the company needs to be enabled by further investments over the course of this year, which is how we landed at the guidance that we suggested, which is a lot of confidence that when we make investments with the right plan, we know what we're looking at to gauge success and we hold ourselves to that from an execution standpoint, we have a pattern of delivering great results. That started a few years ago when we were building our - rebuilding our international audience. Our growth rate in international users had been ticking down and with concerted effort, the right investment plan and great execution, we turned that around and reaccelerated our user growth outside of the U.S. That was fantastic. We built a monetization plan in the U.S. that was forward investing in building a business, and that worked well. We did the same thing for international monetization. And again, we've talked about this in the past, put a lot of investment in creating a compelling shopping experience from a user perspective and are now building a business around that. So I'm confident that like all of those other projects, our long-term focus, the strategic outcomes that we're looking for the right answer for this business over the next few years, and accelerating our investments again next year will help us deliver against that. Is that helpful?\nJustin Post: Yeah, great. Thank you.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, we'll take our last question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Rohit Kulkarni of MKM Partners. Rohit, please go ahead.\nRohit Kulkarni: Thank you. Two, if I could. One is just in the past, you've commented on in-home versus out-of-home use cases and kind of underlying engagement trending one way or the other. I just pointed here is that the only creative showcased in the letter is a travel vlogger. So if you could just comment on like how are the engagement for, say, out-of-home say travel, beauty trending versus in-home use cases? And another question is on managed versus fee kind of automated advertising campaigns. If you could just call out what type of advertisers are choosing one versus the other? Is there a pathway that you think that an advertiser goes from a managed full funnel ad campaign to a completely automated ad campaign? So those are two questions. Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Why don't I - I'll start with the second question. I think we've seen a lot of success in our managed advertising community, those that we cover both with respect to field sellers, all the way through our kind of mid-market coverage team. And we've been making a lot of investments in automating our ad stack to make it easier for those advertisers to onboard, scale their spend and increasingly see the results of that spend. We're not at the point yet today where that experience is as fully instrumented as we would like it to be to have an unmanaged long-tail advertiser base on the platform. And so we've been focusing on the managed go-to-market model until we get that up and running. And we've been making all the right investments, seeing all the right returns. With respect to building that ad stack, it will just take some time before we get there. So that's one. I don't know, Ben, if you wanted to talk about these cases\nBen Silbermann: Yeah, Rohit. I mean, Pinterest use cases have often reflected what's going on in broader society. So as Todd mentioned, we saw a big change with outbreak and the pandemic. And hopefully, we're seeing a little bit more return to normalcy. I think we're all hoping for that. I also say on Pinterest itself, always had historical strength in some core lifestyle verticals. One of our hopes is that as we scale the creator ecosystem and give creators the ability to directly build their own communities on Pinterest. We'll start to see some expansion and see different types of use cases emerge. Still early days. But again, it's kind of one of the benefits that we can build that ecosystem. And so we're excited to continue investing in that because we think it will advance our mission of inspiring people and helping them create a life they love.\nNeil Doshi: Great. Thank you for joining our call, everyone, and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for the first quarter of 2022. We were pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $847 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%. While most of the details about our financial performance in our shareholder letter, I'd like to provide some additional color. Strength in the quarter came from large retailers, midsized and managed small advertisers and international markets. This was offset by muted demand from CPG advertisers who continue to face pressure from supply chain issues. Furthermore, with the continued distribution and placement of Idea Pins during the quarter, we estimate that the negative impact to our fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, similar to the third quarter. This impact was factored into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I wanted to take a couple of minutes to discuss fourth quarter engagement, particularly in the U.S. Our U.S. monthly active users declined 12% year-over-year to $86 million, primarily due to pandemic easing relative to the year ago quarter. We also believe that time spent on competing video app platforms contributed to the year-on-year declines. Furthermore, our monthly active users were negatively impacted from lower search traffic due to Google's November algorithm updates. In fact, more than half of the Q3 to Q4 sequential decline in U.S. monthly active users was attributable to Google's algorithm update starting in mid-November. We're examining the overall impact from recent search algorithm changes as it appears to be more persistent than we've seen historically. Our teams are working diligently to understand this, but it may take some time. Looking at users by platform, U.S. monthly active users coming to Pinterest from the web, desktop and mobile web declined around 30% year-over-year while U.S. monthly active users coming to Pinterest from mobile apps who account for a significant majority of our impressions and our revenue declined around 6% year-over-year. We're taking a number of steps to increase engagement on Pinterest. First, we're investing in native video content in a creator led content ecosystem. In the long run, we believe that this can be engagement and revenue accretive. As Ben mentioned, the early data make us cautiously optimistic. But bending the curve on overall engagement will require us to scale this effort with sustained execution over several quarters. In the near term, we plan to invest in our core discovery and planning engines to provide our users with a richer even more personalized experience across our various surfaces. We plan to apply more data and larger models to our sophisticated machine learning stack to help with content recommendations, home feed personalization and an improved search experience for existing, previous and new users who come to Pinterest. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q1. In my remarks last quarter, I noted that engagement trends on Pinterest had not yet returned to pre-pandemic norms, specifically to the mix of at-home versus out-of-home use cases that we saw in 2019. In Q4, these trends began to normalize. For example, the propensity of Pinners to adopt use cases like home decor or cooking in the fourth quarter of 2021 was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019. As we revert to our pre-pandemic use case mix, we expect that the pandemic unwind will be a less meaningful engagement headwind as we move through 2022, particularly after mid-March when we will lap the widespread easing of lockdown restrictions. That said, engagement headwinds from search algorithm changes and from time spent on competing platforms are more persistent and could potentially disrupt normal seasonal trends. Given this context, we think it's most helpful to tell you what we know today. As of Tuesday, February 1, U.S. monthly active users were approximately $86.6 million and global monthly active users were approximately $436.8 million. On the revenue side, we expect Q1 revenue to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q1 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, the macro environment remains challenging for our CPG advertisers who are still dealing with supply chain and other macroeconomic issues. We believe this headwind could persist for a few quarters. Second, we continue to monitor the impact that higher CPAs could have on our more price-sensitive advertisers. There are some exogenous factors that appear to be resulting in higher CPAs, including overall demand for digital ads from advertisers. On Pinterest, specifically, if engagement declines continue, we could eventually expect to see some constraints on our monetizable supply and in turn, higher CPAs. This supply constraint is not something that we're seeing today, but we're monitoring it carefully. At the same time, we're investing in a number of opportunities to monetize our existing supply and to help advertisers achieve their goals. Third, our investment in Idea Pins and native video content will likely be a modest headwind to revenue in future quarters as it was in Q4. However, we believe that Idea Pins will be both engagement and revenue accretive over time. Finally, I want to touch on expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 27% year-over-year. This year, we plan to accelerate our investments in the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, shopping, our Pinner experience and advertiser success. We expect our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow around 10% quarter-over-quarter sequentially, as we continue to scale our investments in our native content ecosystem, our core Pinner experience and headcount across research and development and sales and marketing. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow around 40% year-over-year. The sequencing of that spend may change from quarter-to-quarter, but we'd suggest you look at the quarterly growth cadence in 2021 as a likely template. Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Eric. It's a great question because we're obviously one of the biggest growth drivers and clearest opportunities for us to continue the momentum we've had with our great traction with revenue performance is through international markets. I think the thing that we - it starts with building a great team. We have some tremendous country leaders. We have some great sales leadership, and I'm really excited about the folks that we brought on board. We've had a lot of hiring over the last year. And we've just done a great job of bringing the right people into Pinterest with the right leadership team. So that's one. More broadly, we often get the question why weren't we monetizing internationally quicker? And part of the reason was we wanted to get the user experience and the advertising experience right, both for our Pinners and to make sure we are delivering great results to our advertisers when we started to monetize internationally. And that's what we've done. We've proven that our full funnel advertising platform works in the U.S. We've built the right ad tech stack against that. We have the right go-to-market model and the right coverage model that we've built out in the U.S. And what we've been able to do internationally is start to replicate the same trends. There's a lot of learning and a lot of education and sales that needs to happen because of the nature of this platform. What we found - and you've asked questions in the past about which kinds of advertisers find success on Pinterest? What we've learned is that those that value being on an inspiration-driven platform, one that is brand safe, advertisers that value unique insights in the commercial mindset of users long before they buy something and who are open, therefore, to longer attribution windows. Those are the advertisers that find success. And so we're seeing that same playbook, which takes a little longer to unfold to build those relationships, generate that kind of understanding in the advertising community. But when it pays off, it's paying off with great traction and great growth in those markets that we've opened, most notably in Western Europe. You asked the question about 2022. In terms of growth, we're opening up in a couple more countries in Latin America. So Colombia, Chile and Argentina will open this year. So extending the reach within Latin America. And then as you mentioned, we're really excited to start monetizing in a very deep ad market in APAC in Japan. So all of that work is on track. And I would expect us to continue to see some contribution from those markets by the end of this year, but it takes time. And reflecting on your question, we opened Latin America last year. And while we've seen some early contribution. We've got a long way to go. And I think that's exciting for the future growth potential of the company. Yeah, Mark, I don't know if - I'm happy to start, and then Ben can weigh in a little bit on the product work that we're doing. I think the short answer to your question is - we're investing in our short form video content creator led content, native content ecosystem to address exactly that point. And we think that's the path toward enriching the user experience and building connections to shopping experiences overtime that will drive frequency of use, more people to the platform and overtime, a connection to shopping and commercial activity that will differentiate the platform, both with respect to users and advertisers. So that's the overall longer term answer. We're also focused on making the user experience more rewarding this year by leveraging the data we have, increasing personalization improving our recommendation engine. So continuing a lot of the things that we've talked about over the last couple of years to further build out a really rewarding user experience. And I think that will drive more people to the platform for more things in their life, more session frequency and ultimately, more conversions and economic activity. I don't know if it came through clearly before. But in terms of stability, we're looking at a couple of things. One is - last quarter, we talked a lot about the pandemic impact. We had the benefit of the pandemic from an engagement standpoint, when folks lock down, we shifted - user behavior shifted to more at-home use cases versus out-of-home use cases. And because of our strength and use cases associated with out of home activities, we benefited. That reversed last year in the spring when out-of-home use cases became more prevalent. And we saw the unwinding of some of those engagement gains in user growth. We, from Q3 to Q4, did see a large impact globally and in the U.S. from the search algorithm changes from Google. And so sequential growth, the bulk of that decline Q3 to Q4 was not pandemic related. It was more related to search algorithm changes that drove less search-related traffic to Pinterest. If you stripped out the impact of that, we were actually up in terms of direct mobile app users globally in the high single digits year-over-year. Internationally, we were up 11%. In the U.S., we were down around 6%. So much more resilient engagement with respect to the users who are the deepest, most dedicated resilient users who drive the bulk of our impressions, time spent and revenue. I don't know if that's helpful. Ben, I don't know if you want to pile on with respect to the investments we're making in product? Yeah. I think a couple of questions in there. One was around the direct traffic and search-driven traffic. And then the other was on native checkout. On the second, we just started piloting and testing native checkout. And we look forward to continuing to scale and broaden those efforts over the course of the year. So it's still pretty early days. On the direct traffic mix, I tried to lay out a couple of ways I've been thinking about it. One was the bridge on sequential and year-over-year trends with respect to MAUs. And I wanted to give you a little bit more color on that direct usage, mobile app usage to give some color on the difference between search-driven traffic and search-driven MAUs versus those that are direct for the reason that you described. The truth is that Google makes algorithm changes regularly. We did see another one in November that had a material impact, which is why we're calling it out. It's not the first time it's happened. And we are working on how to best factor that into our product mix and respond to it. But the long-term answer is to have a robust native content ecosystem, which we're building, and I think that will be the long-term answer on engagement. Thanks. Colin, why don't I start with the question on the search-driven traffic? And then I'll let Ben talk about the team and leadership piece. We've talked - remember back to our - when we were marketing the company on the road show, we talked about a lot of our user growth being different on Pinterest versus social media.

But the two are very important when considered together. So that's why we've broken it out the way we did. I can start. Thanks for the questions. So on the additional metrics that you were asking about, weekly active users, time spent, et cetera. We do disclose a ratio in our public filings on an annual basis around weekly active users as a percentage of monthly active users, and that's been pretty stable over the last few years. So that's the answer on one. With respect to shopping we are seeing a much better user experience, enabled by a lot of the investments we've been making over the last few years, dedicated shopping surfaces that allow users to go from idea to purchase in a much more natural kind of shopping in a much more natural shopping journey. And at the same time, we've dramatically improved the amount of inventory we can serve with our catalog ingestion work and the APIs that we've developed. As a result of that, we've seen a number of users who are engaging in shopping surfaces grow pretty meaningfully. We're up 20% sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and 20% year-over-year. So really encouraging. And I think there are a lot of connections that we can build over the next few years across this native video ecosystem, our creator-led content ecosystem coupled with a lot of the shopping investments we're making should make a really differentiated experience on Pinterest. You may have also noted that we got some press a couple of days ago on the AR, some of the AR products we've been shipping that have really improved from a technology perspective, our ability to deliver pretty interesting shopping experiences. So really excited about some of the innovation that our teams have built. Thanks, Justin. Well, we did have kind of a banner year with respect to performance. We - gross margins were at incredibly high levels. By the end of the year, our spend profile, we continue to invest aggressively. Our headcount growth, I think a year ago, it was like 15% in the fourth quarter. That ticked up a few points every quarter until we got to 27% in the fourth quarter of this year. We're investing in a lot further - more head count growth going into next year. I think what we've proven is that we have a great business model and that the business is working. I think we've also internally come to the view that the long-term potential of the company needs to be enabled by further investments over the course of this year, which is how we landed at the guidance that we suggested, which is a lot of confidence that when we make investments with the right plan, we know what we're looking at to gauge success and we hold ourselves to that from an execution standpoint, we have a pattern of delivering great results. That started a few years ago when we were building our - rebuilding our international audience. Our growth rate in international users had been ticking down and with concerted effort, the right investment plan and great execution, we turned that around and reaccelerated our user growth outside of the U.S. That was fantastic. We built a monetization plan in the U.S. that was forward investing in building a business, and that worked well. We did the same thing for international monetization. And again, we've talked about this in the past, put a lot of investment in creating a compelling shopping experience from a user perspective and are now building a business around that. So I'm confident that like all of those other projects, our long-term focus, the strategic outcomes that we're looking for the right answer for this business over the next few years, and accelerating our investments again next year will help us deliver against that. Is that helpful? Why don't I - I'll start with the second question. I think we've seen a lot of success in our managed advertising community, those that we cover both with respect to field sellers, all the way through our kind of mid-market coverage team. And we've been making a lot of investments in automating our ad stack to make it easier for those advertisers to onboard, scale their spend and increasingly see the results of that spend. We're not at the point yet today where that experience is as fully instrumented as we would like it to be to have an unmanaged long-tail advertiser base on the platform. And so we've been focusing on the managed go-to-market model until we get that up and running. And we've been making all the right investments, seeing all the right returns. With respect to building that ad stack, it will just take some time before we get there. So that's one. I don't know, Ben, if you wanted to talk about these cases"

            "name": "Ben Silbermann",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. And hi, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. 2021 was an important year for Pinterest. We remain laser-focused on helping everyone get inspiration for their lives and building a dedicated space online to plan and create their features. We believe that the demand for a positive place to play in near future will only continue to grow over the long-term. That's why we spent the past year investing heavily in evolving how we inspire Pinners by building a new publishing platform for creators. We believe that when we connect Pinners, not just with great ideas but also with the great creators behind them, enrich new formats like short form video, the overall experience is more inspirational. And when people are more inspired, they do more planning and shopping. Advertisers are able to reach consumers with more intent. And that, in turn, drives more value for Pinterest. In 2021, we made our publishing tools available in 37 markets and launched 150 new features, many of which were released in October. So it's still very early, but we're already seeing signs of promise specifically a rise in session frequency and time spent from people who followed multiple creators. This supports our hypothesis that our investments in native content can be engagement accretive over time. We believe that with sustained investment will see these trends grow as more and more Pinners find and follow creators they love. We know we're building this new platform in a challenging environment. In Q4, we saw monthly active users decreased 6% year-over-year to 431 million. This was primarily due to the continued unwinding of the pandemic, lower traffic coming from search and increasing competition for user attention. We're clear eyed about these recent headwinds, and we believe that over the long term, our new publishing platform will deep engagement by Pinners. We're also continuing to improve the core experience to help surface the most relevant content at the right time. With shopping, we're building a more dedicated experience to help people discover and buy what they love as well as expanding our test of seamless checkout. We're also working to improve the advertiser experience. Helping them optimize their budgets and more effectively measure performance with the changing privacy landscape. And we're working to build on the business milestones we achieved in 2021, where we surpassed $2 billion in revenue for the year growing revenue 52% over the previous year. We also posted our first full year of GAAP profitability. Our aspiration is to build an end-to-end platform that gives people great inspiration and the tools to buy, to make and to do those ideas for their lives. All in the space that's both positive and encouraging. We believe that the world needs this. And that's why we're increasing our investment to build it. And I'm confident that our team is up to the task. So now I'll turn it over to Todd who will share more. Sure, Ross. I'll take a few questions in turn. So first of all, taking a step back, a lot of people are coming out of the pandemic, and they're reassessing their careers. And so along with many companies, we see what some people are calling a great employee reshuffle. But based on conversations with some of our peers, we believe that our attrition rate is roughly in line with others. I'd also remind everyone that we've been hiring pretty aggressively. We grew our headcount by 27% over the last year. The tech is covered, our tech press has covered some recent departures and many of the folks in articles that were named are people that joined pre-IPO several years ago. They joined a relatively small private company. They made an incredible contribution. I'm grateful for what they've done. And I'm excited for a lot of them to take their next step in bigger roles at smaller companies or in some cases, changing industries entirely. I'd also say that we just have an amazing bench of talent here at Pinterest. And this provides our existing employees that you have to take on more responsibility and to step in the new leadership roles, which we're just thrilled about. Finally, we've been able to welcome some great senior talent in new areas where we're making investments, including shopping and content. So that's kind of the story there. Your second question is about the Watch tab. What I'd say is that we're not breaking out engagement by surface just yet, but we're really optimistic even though it's early days on the creative effort in general and in the Watch tab specifically. And I would just remind folks why we're making the investment and why we're excited about it. The first reason we're making an investment really comes down to the core value proposition on Pinterest, which is to provide inspiration. And we think short form video and connecting people real creators is just an enormous opportunity to advance that vision in new ways. Short from video is being adopted all over the industry. But today, what we see from most of our competitors is that the innovation on short form video has been focused on entertainment, while Pinterest is more focused on providing, inspiring and useful experiences that can help people get ideas and then actually realize them by making, by buying or by doing something in real life. The second reason that we're excited is we think that over time, the creators' effort can increase both time spent on the platform, but also the frequency with which people visit. People often come to Pinterest when something is going on in their life. They might want to remodel their home, they might want to take on a new life project or plan a trip. And that's fantastic, but the engagement tends to be more periodic. If you look at a lot of the largest platforms in the world, they are either social networks with a strong messaging component, which pulls you back or they have some sort of published subscribed mechanism between creators and their audiences. And up until late last year, Pinterest had neither. It was really buoyed by the utility of the platform. We think by connecting people to inspiring creators who can share their passions and their ideas every day. Over the long-term, that can shift. So we're in really early days, but we're excited about both improving the core experience for users and the net impact will have on the business Todd, I thought you did a great job giving an overview. Mark, the only thing I would add is we've talked about kind of three different kind of investments that we're making: Investment in creators; an investment in shopping. So when people see things, they can buy them; and then, of course, the investment in our core personalization and discovery experiences. But if you take a step back as a user like our aspiration is to build 1 coherent experience where all 3 of those things play an important role. Today, there are places to connect with your friends, there are places to be entertained. But our vision is to build kind of an inspiration to realization platform where you visit. You connect with traders that are aligned with your interests. We understand your taste and we recommend individual products, and then you can eventually buy those things directly. And that end-to-end experience is something that doesn't exist online. So these three investments will play out over time. I would say the creators is the earliest. Most of those features just launched in October, but it adds an important new element. This year, we'll continue to improve our shopping experiences. We'll expand our test to native checkout. We'll build more dedicated and personalized services on top of a shopping API. And then we're always investing into that core personalization and relevance. And that's really been buoyed by advances in machine learning and computer vision, which are core competencies for the company. So Pinterest is really charting a different course. I know in these calls, everything gets reduced down into time spend and ads. And those are, of course fundamental things that we look at all the time. But we're really focused on owning this inspiration to realization space in the market. We think that's very differentiated from social networks and from pure entertainment platforms. And the three investments that Todd mentioned on creators, shopping and personalization are all driving towards that common vision. Sure, Brian. I'll talk about four kind of themes that our advertising and shopping teams keep in mind. And then I'll go into them in a little bit more detail: And the first one we talked about before, is automation. So we're going to continue our automation journey, especially automating ad campaign management. The second is going to be relevant and optimization. Third, which Todd touched on, was international expansion. And then finally, shopping. And I'll just like walk through them individually. And I think together, they'll give you some more color on the journey that we're on. So look, just starting with automation. We still believe that we have a lot of runway as we automate ad campaign management. I mean our goal has always been that an advertiser should be able to show up with their budget, their goals and their content and Pinterest should take care of the rest. And we're still pretty far away from doing that. So in the past, you heard us talking about bidding automation. But this year, our investments are really directly linked to providing more value to midsized and small advertisers that are natural fit for Pinterest. And so that should result in increasing the efficiency of our ad marketplace and delivering greater value. Second is relevance. This is sort of this thing that never stops, but we really believe we have room to improve our relevance engines which should further improve the efficiency of our ads. Again, underlying that is leveraging our taste graph and leveraging machine learning. So when people see ads, they feel just like content. Third, we talked a little bit about international. Like I said, Todd did a great job of covering that we're expanding to new markets. And I'm really excited that the team that we built there and the playbook that we've developed over the last few years, we're kind of learning with each subsequent market how to get off our feet a little bit quicker. And then finally, when we look across all of our services. We know that the shopping surface in particular, the surface with the highest commercial intent still has huge headroom for monetization. So we're investing in building that great consumer experience first. But we see year-over-year increases in the number of people doing product searches, the amount of time that they're spending on shopping surfaces. And we're also simplifying our shopping ad formats so brands can just more easily promote their products. So there's a lot there. We'll be experimenting with Idea Pins monetization. We expect that to lag. We're going to wait for that creative economy to sort of get off speed. But we think there are some pretty significant drivers of future revenue growth that we're still in the early innings of pursuing. Sure, Rich. Well, I think there are two parts to the answer. First, like as CEO and fiduciary, I'm always keeping an open mind. But I really do believe that we have a pretty unique place in the market. And I touched on it before, but I can go into a little bit more detail. First, there is a huge audience is coming to Pinterest for something that's fundamentally different than what they come to other platforms. They're not coming to connect with her friends. They're actually coming to envision their future and to plan for it. And increasingly, we're getting better and better at helping them do that planning, at connecting to the people that can share the knowledge and the inspiration to advance that, and then eventually comes into the retailers into the individual products they need. I really think that planning your future, that's a fundamental human need. That's not going away. And we're laser-focused on targeting that need above all the other ones. The second thing I'd say is that Pinterest sits at this pretty interesting intersection of a few trends that are really secular growth trends in the industry. Commerce is one of those. And we have a lot of people coming with specific intent to do something, but it may not settle on specific product they are for. And I think that's base of shopping not just buying, but actually shopping, discovering what you're looking for, finding some of the lines of your taste, that's still quite open. And then finally, we're investing in creator ecosystem and online video. And I truly believe that video and mobile video, it's still in its infancy as an industry. I believe that we're going to see verticalization happen over time. And we're well positioned to pioneer in a new media format to do both inspiration but also to allow creators to facilitate action in providing different revenue models for them and being a real source of economic growth for that new creator business. And so what we've laid out over the last few years - yeah? Sure, Rich. I mean, look, we take all competition seriously. I would argue that competition for kind of user attention and time right now is probably the most competitive industry in the world. So of course, TikTok we think about. We think about Meta. We think about Google. But we also really try to focus on what we can offer that's differentiated. And that was the spirit of the last answer. So I hope that's helpful. Yes, Colin. And as you pointed out, we welcomed Malik from YouTube. He's our first Chief Content Officer, it kind of reflects the role and the importance of content on the platform going forward. Look, I would say there are a few things. One is, as a company, we have a lot to learn about audience development. We're really impressed with kind of at least analytical problem solving as well as experience in both kind of premium and user-generated content. The other thing that I was really interested in is that Pinterest really wants to be a place where the content that we serve to folks is nourishing, is positive and it's inspirational. I think over the last few years, a lot of our users have appreciated that while many services online kind of have quite a bit of polarization or toxicity or sometimes content that they don't feel like is enriching. Pinterest has tried to have a little bit of a tighter focus on something that's positive and inspiring. And that's because that's core to our mission, right? If you're thinking about being inspired for your life, it's important that you're in an environment on where the content is positive overall. And so looking at some of his experience working with more positive content ecosystems, whether it's like YouTube Kids or on the premium side, I thought brought some really important insight. I'd also share that we're building a whole team. And so there's always a lot of attention on leaders, but I'm excited about the team's ability to move fast and innovate and really chart its own path. Because I think that all of these content platforms while in their initial days, they may look similar. They're going to end up looking different and verticalizing. And so we're going to need to really follow kind of the Pinterest users and develop a content offering that really works towards our mission of inspiring them in their day-to-day life. Yeah, Rohit. I mean, Pinterest use cases have often reflected what's going on in broader society. So as Todd mentioned, we saw a big change with outbreak and the pandemic. And hopefully, we're seeing a little bit more return to normalcy. I think we're all hoping for that. I also say on Pinterest itself, always had historical strength in some core lifestyle verticals. One of our hopes is that as we scale the creator ecosystem and give creators the ability to directly build their own communities on Pinterest. We'll start to see some expansion and see different types of use cases emerge. Still early days. But again, it's kind of one of the benefits that we can build that ecosystem. And so we're excited to continue investing in that because we think it will advance our mission of inspiring people and helping them create a life they love."

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Jane Penner with Pinterest. Please go ahead.\nJane Penner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest's earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. I'm Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, Pinterest's President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations. Now I'll cover the safe harbor.  Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q4 2021 and beyond are preliminary and are not an indication of future performance.  We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later, unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com.  And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for joining the call. Todd and I will give a bit more context about the quarter, and then we'll open it up to questions.  I want to just start by saying how grateful I am for our team. In the face of so much uncertainty in the world, we continue to deliver great products for Pinners, creators and businesses. And I'm proud that, despite macro challenges like supply chain shortages, we grew revenue 43% year-over-year to $633 million. That was thanks to increasing demand from larger retail advertisers and growth in our international business. It's another signal that advertisers see different value on Pinterest than in other platforms.  On engagement, monthly active users grew 1% to 444 million as we continue to see the pandemic unwind impact our engagement. While we had an uptick in our core out-of-home use cases, like fashion and beauty, they didn't outweigh the downtick we saw with core in-the-home-use cases a trend that began in March. However, we don't believe this is a permanent change in behavior. Although the timing is hard to predict, we think that MAUs will return to a more normal seasonal growth pattern in the future, as more and more people return to looking for ideas for their homes, recipes, their families and so much more.  In the bigger picture, we think there is growing demand for a positive place on the Internet to discover great ideas, try them and buy them. And that's why we remain focused on building a place that feels healthy and encouraging; a place to envision your best life with rich new tools; and a place that connects you to ideas, businesses and creators to help you turn inspiration into reality.  For a long time, we've talked about helping people make the journey all the way from inspiration to realization, which is why we continued to invest in the core product to make it more shoppable. We've added new features like Slide Show Collections, which allow merchants to easily display more of their products in a full-screen video format. We've expanded our Verified Merchant Program into 7 new markets, including Brazil, Italy and Spain. We've introduced product-tagging and affiliate links for Idea Pins, so creators can help Pinners shop their favorite brands. And these efforts are showing results. Overall product searches were up over 100% year-over-year. searches on the Shop tab by Gen Z were up 200% year-over-year.  In Q4, we started testing a more seamless checkout experience, and so we're excited about the momentum. At the same time, we continue to execute our longer-term creator strategy to evolve how by our Pinners. We believe that our investments in a native creator-driven ecosystem will lead to deeper engagement over time, with Idea Pins accelerating the rich video content on interest, offering new ways to get inspired and giving people new reasons to visit Pinterest more frequently as they find and follow creators their love.  In just the past few weeks, we've released a number of new features to execute on this strategy. A new Watch tab, where folks can watch a vertical feed of full screen Idea Pins; a new feature called Takes, where users can publish their own personal spin and Idea Pins and encourage others to try those same ideas; a new rewards program to pay creators for sharing their passions with their audience; and most recently, Pinterest TV, which offers live original episodes featuring creators.  And this is just the beginning. This is a long-term investment for us into the future of inspiring lifestyle media. So while that's changed in the world over the past 1.5 years, one thing we believe hasn't changed is our value proposition. If people want a place to focus on themselves, not others, define what they truly love, not just what others like and to envision their best selves and to make that future possible. We believe that places Pinterest, and that's why I'm as excited as ever about our future.  Now I'll turn it over to Todd.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in Q3 and provide a preliminary outlook for Q4. We were pleased with the financial results that we delivered. Q3 revenue of $633 million grew 43% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding nearly 1,100 basis points to 32% when compared to the third quarter of last year. While most of the details about our financial performance is in our shareholder letter, I'd like to provide a little bit of additional color. We estimate that absent the macro supply chain issues this year and the benefit from the social media boycott last year, advertising spend from CPG advertisers would have had a positive mid-single-digit impact on our Q3 year-over-year revenue growth.  Also, we continued to scale the distribution and placement of Idea Pins during the quarter. We estimate that the negative impact to our Q3 year-over-year revenue growth was in the mid-single digits. This impact was factored into our guidance for Q3.  Finally, we don't believe we saw a material revenue impact from Apple's ATT policy changes during Q3. That said, it's still too early to predict the long-term revenue impact of these and future iOS changes.  On engagement, global monthly active users grew 1% year-over-year. We continued to face headwinds, primarily from pandemic easing, as Ben described, but also due to a lower contribution to monthly active user growth from Gen Z users and due to SEO changes that impacted web traffic to our service, particularly in certain emerging international markets.  We remain encouraged by the fact that global mobile app MAUs continue to grow double digits year-over-year. In the U.S., our mobile app MAUs remained relatively resilient when compared to our web-based MAUs, which declined double digits year-over-year.  Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q4. The exact impact of the pandemic and its aftermath on our engagement and revenue remains unknown. On the engagement side, it's worth pausing for a moment to recap our understanding of engagement trends on Pinterest over the last couple of quarters. When lockdowns began to ease last spring, we saw a precipitous drop in some of our core at-home use cases like home decor, cooking and DIY, and they haven't fully recovered yet. When you look at Pinterest today, the propensity to adopt at-home use cases, such as home decor and food and drink, is less than it was before the pandemic began, while the propensity to adopt use cases like beauty and women's fashion has grown. That's what's driving our belief that we're not in a normal environment yet.  As Ben said, we don't believe that this trend reflects a permanent change in human behavior, and we think monthly active users will eventually return to a more normal seasonal growth pattern. While we believe this, the timing is uncertain because the pandemic and subsequent user behavior remains difficult to predict, as evidenced by Q3 monthly active users not following a typical seasonal trend. So we're monitoring this as well as SEO changes and the impact of time spent on competitive platforms as we mentioned last quarter.  In this environment, we continue to build the most inspiring product we can, and we're confident that the investments we're making in native content will be engagement and revenue-accretive in the long term.  Given this context, we think it is most helpful to let you know where we are today. As of Tuesday, November 2, U.S. monthly active users were approximately 89 million, and global monthly active users were approximately 447 million. While the quarter-to-date trend suggests some stabilization of monthly active users, the pandemic unwind has distorted our typical seasonal trends as we saw in Q3, so it's hard to predict exactly how the quarter will play out from here.  On the revenue side, we expect total revenue to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q4 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, the macro environment remains challenging. For our CPG advertisers, supply chain issues are still front and center, and they're not sure when things will improve. Also, it's possible that the macro and supply chain issues will affect other non-CPG verticals more in Q4 than they did during the third quarter.  Second, we're facing tough year-over-year comps this quarter. In the year-ago quarter, our investments in ads automation meaningfully drove year-on-year revenue, we had a very strong Q4 2020 holiday season, and we attracted ad spend for being a positive platform during the social media boycott in the 2020 election.  Third, we continue to monitor the impacts that higher CPAs could have on our more price-sensitive advertisers. There are some exogenous factors that appear to be resulting in higher CPAs, including overall demand for digital ads from advertisers. On Pinterest specifically, if engagement declines continue, we'd eventually expect to see some constraints on our monetizable supply and, in turn, higher CPAs. This is not something we're seeing today, and we are monitoring this dynamic. At the same time, we're investing in a number of opportunities to monetize our existing supply and help advertisers achieve their goals.  Finally, as we scale the distribution of Idea Pins, traffic will increasingly shift to relatively undermonetized surfaces such as Idea Pins streams and our new vertical video, Watch tab. These new surfaces will likely remain under monetized in the medium term as we optimize the user experience to drive engagement. This investment will likely be a modest headwind to revenue in the future quarters, as it was in Q3, and as reflected in our Q4 guide. However, we believe that Idea Pins will be both engagement and revenue-accretive over time.  Finally, I'd like to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, the Pinner experience, advertiser success and shopping. Our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 grew 26% year-over-year. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low-teens percentage basis quarter-over-quarter as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term strategic initiatives and invest in our brand-marketing campaign in the fourth quarter.  Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Two questions. I guess one for Ben. The new creator tools and Idea Pins and Watch tab, it's just all the new creator activity. If we look out 2 to 3 years, what kind of uptake do you think this could get? And what kind of impact on overall engagement? Are we talking iterative? Or could it be material? Any thoughts on that and just how it's going in the early days here.  And then, Todd, the 4Q guide actually looks pretty decent. If you look at it sequentially, kind of low 30s quarter-on-quarter, pretty good considering all the moving pieces right now. I guess, any more color on like what's outperforming as you go into 4Q? What's underperforming aside from CPG? And can we get an update just high level on how big the kind of big 3 are, retail, CPG and all other, in terms of like percent of revenue?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Thanks for your question, Ross. I'll start by talking about creators, and then Todd will address your second question. So on creators, like maybe just taking a step back, I just want to remind everyone of why we're investing in this in the first place. And there are 2 principal reasons.  The first is that Pinterest is fundamentally about inspiration. We have long inspired people with web-based images, but we think that video is a fundamental format for inspiration in the future. And today, mobile video is really still in its infancy. So you're seeing all these different platforms develop video products that play to their core strengths. Some are about entertainment. Some are about social connection. And at Pinterest, we see this opportunity enable creators to produce videos that are really aligned with what people are there to do on Pinterest, which is get inspired and take action. And so we think that we have a unique value proposition in that space. So one strategic goal is to better deliver on our mission through rich interactive video, and we think this will both deepen engagement over time and drive actions to shop behavior.  The second goal, and you kind of suggest this, is to give our users more reasons to come back to Pinterest with greater frequency. And historically, people mostly come to Pinterest when something in their offline lives needs attention. For example, they might be planning a project for a home remodel or preparing for a seasonal events such as back-to-school. And that means engagement tends to be episodic and driven by events that are exogenous to the service itself.  But on the Internet, when people subscribe to content from their favorite creators and brands, they have more reasons to visit a service and engage more frequently, regardless of what else is happening offline. So integrating this published subscribed model into Pinterest cannot only make the product more inspirational and more useful, but can also meaningfully change engagement.  Look, it's still early days. It's going to take several quarters for these efforts in need of content to kind of meaningfully move the needle. But I'm really proud of the team. We invested significant resources off of kind of more conventional growth investments to build out a new Watch tab, visibility of a tag products; the new feature that we mentioned called Takes; and as you mentioned, most recently, pinches TV. And we're starting to see those efforts getting some momentum. And Idea Pins creator daily grew more than 15x since the beginning of the year. The number of weekly active Idea Pins creators grew 30x, and the time spent on those Pins has been increasing as well.  So all of that is to say we're really optimistic about it. We're going to continue to invest. We consider this a long-term priority, and we tend to go long on the things that we believe in. We did it with shopping. We did it with global expansion and performance advertising and now we're going to deal with online content creation.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And then Ross, I think your -- the second question was about the fourth quarter guide, and I can give a little bit more color on that. So I know folks look at this in a variety of ways. But we often get the question on a stacked growth basis. I think it's in the mid-90s on a CAGR basis over the last couple of years. We're in the mid-40s, which is largely consistent with trend. So I think your point holds there.  The color behind that is we expect that the CPG headwinds, which aren't unique to us, it's an industry-wide phenomenon. I would expect that, that continues through the fourth quarter. The question is whether it broadens beyond CPG, but we haven't seen that yet.  And I mentioned this a little bit before, that we had a lot of really compelling product improvements through our work on automation last year, auto bid, campaign budget optimization and other things that had great results through the year. We had a especially strong holiday season last year, and then we had some election year benefits that persisted beyond Q3 into Q4. So we're lapping that.  And then we're monitoring, as I mentioned, the impact of higher prices on the platform. But the strength is really around our larger retail advertisers, many of whom are buying consideration or traffic objectives right now, continued strength in international and the benefits of our investments in a full funnel performance platform are working. I mean that strategy that we've been talking about for the last couple of years is working, and we're seeing great success with our larger managed mid-market advertisers as a result, which means we're using our monetizable supply more efficiently. Does that answer your question?\nRoss Sandler: Yes. Yes, it does. I mean I don't know if you guys are willing to give it out, but like the revenue mix, I think, is something that comes up off in our conversations around CPG, retail and other and just some of the moving pieces with those 3. So any color, high level on that?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Ross, at the highest level -- thanks for reminding me about that last bit of your question. I -- we grew the business initially on the back of strength in larger retail and CPG advertisers. And that's been a healthy place for us over the last several years. We've diversified, as you know, into other verticals and deeper into the mid-market, in particular, the larger managed mid-market advertisers, especially as we build out more automation in our ad stack and better serve their objectives.  The arc of diversification has moved away on a secular basis, meaning the mix of non-CPG and retail has improved. We still have a lot of exposure to those 2. And given the strength we saw last quarter in retail, we actually saw that kind of mix back toward retail in some respects. Our larger advertisers showed up in force last quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I wanted to ask two questions, if I could. A lot of the other players in the industry have called out the need to build better internal mechanisms and tools around measurement, metrifusion and intent on the back of the privacy changes Apple has made. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense of how you feel you're positioned against broader privacy headwinds in the industry in the coming years? And what investments might be key to you?  And then Ben, I wanted to ask, the company has obviously been written a lot about in the press from a strategy and strategic standpoint a picture lately. How are you thinking about the way Pinterest is sort of positioned against some of the broader industry trends around commerce and advertising and the creative economies you called out? And how much of that you can accomplish sort of organically by yourself?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure, Eric. Well, why don't we start with your question on measurement? Look, we've been talking about being prepared for the shifts in the privacy landscape for quite a while. And so for past 3 or 4 quarters now, we talked about investing in first-party measurement.  Now look, we don't believe that in Q3, we saw material results. But over the long term, we think that any loss of signal is not helpful in our effort to provide value to advertisers. And it's just early to tell. The long-term revenue impact of Apple policy changes.  The reason we don't think we've seen as much of an impact is multifold. One is that historically, app install ads, which depend heavily on the usage of IDFA, have not contributed a meaningful amount of revenue. We deprecated that format altogether in 2021, so we didn't have much exposure to the loss of signal.  Number two, because our users often have commercial intent and because our service encourages deep engagement, we do have a rich set of first-party data, and that makes us relatively less dependent on third-party signals to serve highly relevant ads. And so we think our models have been pretty resilient to the loss of offsite data.  And then finally, as I mentioned at the top, we've been investing in our ad tech stack just to improve conversion visibility in a privacy-centric solutions. So that's kind of the mix.  I think 1 area that we want to continue investing in, honestly, because it makes the product better for users, is more and more seamless checkout. And that's another area where, over time, as we see more traction there, it will sort of help dampen effects of some of those privacy changes. So that's sort of the first part of your question.  Your second question is a little bit more about how we're thinking about the company strategically and how we're positioned. And I don't want to read between the lines, but maybe one question people are asking is, how you feel as a stand-alone business? And I would say -- and I think that Pinterest is really well positioned for a few reasons. First, this is a significant audience that's coming to Pinterest for a really differentiated use case, right? They're not coming to connect with friends. They're actually coming to envision their future, to plan for it. And increasingly, we're enabling them to take action by acting to the retailers and the products that can turn those inspiration into a reality. That's a pretty unique value proposition, and it's also a very differentiated brand position. We try to invest heavily to make sure that interest remains a positive and inspiring place to both content safety measures, but also through policies which protect that ability for people to envision that positive future.  Second, Pinterest sits at this really interesting intersection of a few trends that are really secular growth trends in the industry. One, as you mentioned, is commerce. And the part of commerce that large online players, say an Amazon are really great at, are showing you products that you already knew you wanted. But when it comes to taste and shopping, things like furniture, clothing, things where esthetics really matter, people are looking for better tools. And Pinterest is the one place where they're growing their express suite to say things that resonate, to explore possibilities across brands and across retailers. I think that puts us in a great position. It's a competitive space, but I think that the most important thing is that we have users coming with that specific intent, and then we're working hard to fill in the gaps in that experience through our shopping solutions.  And then finally, look, the newest investment is an investment in a creator ecosystem in online video. I said it before, but I think online video and mobile video, it's still in its infancy. You're going to see verticalization happen over time. I think Pinterest is really well positioned to pioneer new media formats to do both inspiration but also allow creators to facilitate action, providing different revenue models for them in the future. So that's what's underlaid our strategy for the last couple of years. We've been pretty transparent about it.  And it's been great to see progress about challenging the form of more shopping conversions; increasing traction with our new creator suite, which really just went to market towards the end of October; and just really positive sentiment from our users about Pinterest being the place that they go to, to feel inspired and to plan really important parts of their life.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. Just the first one, I want to go a little bit more into the fourth quarter guide and the factors you helped us out with. Could you just help us understand a little bit? You mentioned the supply chain challenges for CPG, potentially going into other categories. What are you already seeing in October? Are you already seeing CPG companies pull back? Or are you seeing other categories pull back, et cetera? I'm trying to figure out what you've seen in October versus what you're just sort of having conversations about so far.  And then the second one, maybe it's for Ben. I always appreciate the staff about product searches being up 100% and the Gen Z winds up 200%, et cetera. Can you just help us out a little more understand what percentage of the people who come to the platform, even high level, are coming on there and searching with intent as opposed to just looking browsing? I think it'll probably help investors understand a little bit just the value of the social shopping opportunity.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Brian. So on the Q4 guide, I would tell you that the guidance reflects what I know through this call about how we're trending into Q4 and what I see in terms of likely demand and delivery through the end of the quarter. So I'll start there.  I'm not trying to communicate anything that nuanced in that message. It's literally a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q3 that I haven't seen abate thus far in the quarter in core CPG -- in the core CPG market. And I'm reading the news as you do every day about supply chain challenges in that part of the market. And I'm not seeing anything that's unique to us at all with respect to their advertising demand.  It harkens back a little bit to what we saw in the initial part of the COVID period where we saw a pullback from CPG and omnichannel retailers who were either sold out or had stores closed. We're kind of in a same similar dynamic in CPG, where advertising, when you can't deliver product, is challenging, and that's not a Pinterest-specific comment. There's nothing that's changed over the last few weeks relative to what we saw in Q3 that I would call out. And the caution I provided about extensions in other industries is just something that is on my mind, but I'm not yet seeing in the quarter. So hopefully, that's a little bit -- there's no -- I'm not trying to communicate anything that's more nuanced than that.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Brian, on your question of how do we think about shopping engagement on the platform, how many folks are searching and kind of what's going on there. We don't disclose the specifics of the engagement breakdown. But what I can tell you is that search is one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on the platform in general.  And what we try to do in our philosophy in shopping is to make it so any place that you're feeling inspired, we want to make it seamless for you that it connects to a shopping surface. So in search, that means that we'll surface products. And then if you scroll down, you can see related products. Those are shopping surfaces. And over time, there's a lot of opportunity to grow the number of shopping ads within those surfaces. When you're just searching generally, we make it easier and easier for you to find individual retailers. That's been a big push by the team this year.  And even when we talk about new inspirational services, our long-term plan is to connect those to shopping as well. So we talked a little bit about Idea Pins and Pinterest TV, and we want to make sure that experience is great. But a lot of people want to do there is they want to eventually buy the things they see. And so we'll be experimenting ways to connect Idea Pins and Story Pins into those shopping services.  Our goal at all times is to make sure that Pinterest feels inspirational. No one wants to feel like products are being shut down in a road, but at the same time, to make it really easy for you to pivot from that moment of inspiration when you see that perfect scene, where you see that perfect product and make it seamless for you eventually buy it. And so it just started to experiment with some of the seamless checkout work in partnership with a couple of folks, including Shopify in Q4, we're helping them learn. That's just an early pilot. But again, it's about shortening the path from inspiration to purchase without disrupting the user experience at the same time.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: I actually got a couple of questions. I guess, one, just to sort of add on to Eric's questions, Ben. I just -- listening to you, I think the thing that a lot of people are thinking about is your ARPU is still really low versus your peer group, and you don't have the ETT issues that many others have because of your first-party data. So whether it's Q4 or even thinking about 2022, I guess the bigger question is just like why isn't advertising growing dramatically faster just given where your ARPU level is? Is it a -- do you need different ad products? Do you need a different ad selling team? It just feels like there's a big disconnect between the size that you are and the level of monetization. Just curious how you think about that.  And then two, we've heard about Facebook sort of changing the way Instagram looks and moving to a more video-centric feed. I was just thinking like, as you think about Pinterest, does it need to shift as you lean into the creator economy and sort of video? Do you need a different sort of look and feel to how Pinterest just functionally works? Does it need to be more spikable or more video-centric from the start versus sort of the historic Pins on the main page as you go to it? I'd just love your view on sort of both of those issues, especially thinking about mobile.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure, Rich. I'll start with your second question first. And I think it's really about like are we continuing to evolve the user experience to keep up with changing user expectations and changing behavior patterns? And the answer is absolutely yes. So we launched a set of features in October 20. For the first time, we provide things like the Watch tab, which is sort of an immersive vertical strolling format. We think that's certain customers who become really accustomed to. And we think we can provide that format and then we can differentiate the type of content that really aligns to what Pinners are there to do. And so that's just 1 example.  But you'll be seeing us rolling out more and more new experiences that are all sort of principally designed to make it easy to be both kind of browse and inspiration, go deep when they want to and eventually purchase the things they're looking for. So you're right, you're right to ask, and our teams are hard at work in building the changes. I'm really excited actually to get them in front of more users. That just started to roll out all over the world.  Your first question was, why don't we make more money? Why is your ARPU is still low? And I would say -- let me say a few things. First of all, I'm actually enormously proud of the team. We are growing revenue really significantly. And we talked before about a few different significant opportunities that we see for further revenue growth.  The first is international. So we continue to scale international revenue. We're opening up new geographies, and we're getting faster and faster at rolling out products such as shopping that are developed in the U.S. into markets that are earlier in the maturity. And we think that's a big driver of ARPU because, as you know, a lot of our users are outside the United States.  Second, we have a couple of high-intent surfaces that are not that monetized today. And one of the most important is shopping. And what we've been doing is really trying to build more automated ways to bring in more and more inventory. So we talked about catalog uploading. We've also added an API, so we can get more and more products there.  The thing about the shopping services to remember is that relevance really matters, and what underpins relevance is the scale and the structure of the catalog. So that's been a long-term investment, and we're excited to keep driving that. If on top of that, we then reduce the friction in checkout, we think there's a really significant opportunity there ahead. And look, we're working hard. And I'm really pleased with the progress that we're seeing.  The final thing is that the team -- the ads product team has really grown the efficiency of our ads by leaps and downs. Todd mentioned it just briefly, but we've been on this path to improve automation in a number of different firms. They can pay budget optimization as one of the most recent innovations that we've seen really amazing returns on. We've seen advertisers see 20% to 30% lower cost per click, which signals to us that we can give more value to those advertisers, and we think that is a good thing.  As that automation gets adopted by some of our larger advertisers, we think it gives an opportunity to democratize those tools for some of the midsized and smaller advertisers over time. So that's the third opportunity for growth. So I get the question, and we're working hard to grow a great business, and I think we have a lot of really great opportunities ahead of us.\nRichard Greenfield: If I could just tag on, as you think about '22, like do we start to see some -- you talked about a lot of things there, and I appreciate the depths of the answer. How much of that do we start to see as we move through '22?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Well, I'll let Todd expand on it more. I mean I think improvements in things like automation, improvements in ad formats and measurement, those are things that are kind of always driving better and better efficiencies. And I don't think that we've exhausted all those opportunities. And so we continue to work on that.  International, we're investing pretty significantly, and Todd can speak more about new markets that we're opening. We're building out operational teams there. I think farthest away are probably the monetization of Idea Pins and Idea Streams. Those are brand-new experiences. And what we like to do is really get those experiences working well. And we're willing to take a hit on short-term revenue to make sure that users are having a great experience and then find out how to fold in the right monetization opportunities over time.  So Todd mentioned that, that may be a headwind in the coming quarters. That's true, but I also think it's an intentional choice. We want to make sure that we're giving creators clear guidance on how to build the most inspiring content. We're growing our ability to show the right content to the right person, so people feel like they're getting information relevant to them. When those things are established and are driving engagement, we'll find bright ways to add revenue. We're beta testing idea ads. We're beta testing, some really interesting partnerships with brands and creators, but I wouldn't expect those to be big revenue contributors in the short term.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: I want to ask about MAU retention and reactivation strategies that you're thinking about. You obviously had a good number of users that came on, tried Pinterest and probably had decent experiences, but maybe like your very -- or first users only saw it for 1 use case and may not have appreciated the breadth of use cases that one could find on Pinterest. How do you get those people who kind of were one and done for that COVID period? How do you get them to come back and look at a broader -- uses broader applications of Pinterest?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Thanks, Mark. I think it's a great question. I mentioned it at the top, but unlike more social service where you engage with it almost daily to talk to your friends, Pinterest is something that you might come in, use it for a product, a project and then you may pause. And historically, we've seen a lot of our users use it for a period of time and then come back.  Two answers to that. One is that we can do a better job at reengaging those users. And so we're continuing to invest in things like the taste graph and better personalization, which will enable us to do that more and more efficiently, and this is ongoing work to do it really well.  The second answer, and this is longer term, is we'd love for folks actually continue using it from the getgo. And so part of the reason why we're excited about building more published subscribed model is that people can find creators that resonate with them and visit the service more frequently. And again, we're early on in that. But think of those as the 2 approaches. Like one is resurrecting folks by showing them use cases that are relevant in doing that by improving the quality of our personalization and the quality of outreach. And the second, not letting people lapse in the first place because we connect them with creators and use cases that really resonate, and that keeps them using the service more and more often to do more and more different things in their lives.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I have a couple of questions also. I guess, first off, regarding the commentary around new services as a near-term revenue headwind. I guess what are your expectations in terms of time frame needed for those to shift from a negative impact to a positive impact, if there are particular hurdles you're looking for, particularly if you're seeing cannibalization and usage away from legacy surfaces? And then secondly, with respect to the loss of Gen Z users, just curious from what you can tell. Is this part of the cohort that came on during the pandemic? Or could this be a loss of attention to other platforms?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks. So a couple of things. One, Ben, I think, went into a fair amount of detail on what we're building around our creator strategy, which when we execute, will bring people back to the platform more frequently and give them a reason not to churn. So I'm excited about that published subscribe aspect and Pinterest-based communities, keeping people on the platform.  All that said, we're in fairly early innings on all that. We just launched our -- a series of products a couple of weeks ago, which are a great start. I think it will take us a few quarters to get that up and running in a way that builds a great ecosystem across the creator community and our user base. And the reason why I think it takes time is, where Ben started, we take a long-term investment philosophy on these big new initiatives.  If you go back to what we did around international audiences and monetization, that was a multiyear effort to localize content, make sure the user experience resonated outside of the U.S. in the same way it does in the U.S. across the world; and make sure that, that advertising opportunity is as robust relative to market sizing, and those places is what we've seen in the U.S. So that has taken us a few years, and we're seeing great success.  And going back to -- yes, I think it was Mark's question around what does that mean? It means we're still opening up more Latin American markets next year, 3 more markets. We'll open up Japan next year as well. And so those things take years to unfold.  The same is true with shopping. It was a two-sided marketplace where we needed dedicated high-intent surfaces for our users to find products, and we needed the merchant community to upload catalogs in a way that would provide at least the opportunity for us to serve the right organic content or promoted content to the right user at the right time relative to that commercial intent.  Our focus was on making sure the user experience work first, and we're now monetizing that shopping experience better and better over time. But our first focus is on making sure the user experience is positive. The same will be true on these Idea Pin creator ecosystem investments we're making. I'm highly confident that will drive session frequency, depths of engagement around rich discovery opportunities. The published subscribed model will bring people back more regularly around interest-based communities, and I think that this will be a terrific platform for shopping over time. But it will take us -- this is not a next quarter, you'll see a turnaround in engagement. This is a longer-term investment for us.  On the Gen Z point, our best belief is that people went back to school in person. And relative to a year ago, that meant they spent less time in that Gen Z community on our platform. We also had -- if you remember a year ago, we had an iOS update, and there's a fair amount of engagement around wallpaper. That was -- I think we called out 4 million users in the third quarter of last year, which was roughly split geographically similar to the way we look at our global audience in terms of impact. And so that was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter. But the biggest thing that we're looking at is people just going back to school and spending less time on Pinterest in that cohort.\nOperator: This will be our last question, from the line of Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital. Mr. Sanderson, your line is open.\nJane Penner: I'm sorry, operator, do we have Rob on the line? Or should we move to close the call?\nOperator: Mr. Sanderson did not answer. You can now conclude the call.\nJane Penner: Great. I'll hand it over to Ben to end the call.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Well, I just want to thank everyone again for joining and for all the thoughtful questions. I want to thank again the Pinterest team for another quarter of great work. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going, and enjoy the rest of your day or your evening.\nOperator: That concludes the Pinterest's third quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in Q3 and provide a preliminary outlook for Q4. We were pleased with the financial results that we delivered. Q3 revenue of $633 million grew 43% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding nearly 1,100 basis points to 32% when compared to the third quarter of last year. While most of the details about our financial performance is in our shareholder letter, I'd like to provide a little bit of additional color. We estimate that absent the macro supply chain issues this year and the benefit from the social media boycott last year, advertising spend from CPG advertisers would have had a positive mid-single-digit impact on our Q3 year-over-year revenue growth.  Also, we continued to scale the distribution and placement of Idea Pins during the quarter. We estimate that the negative impact to our Q3 year-over-year revenue growth was in the mid-single digits. This impact was factored into our guidance for Q3.  Finally, we don't believe we saw a material revenue impact from Apple's ATT policy changes during Q3. That said, it's still too early to predict the long-term revenue impact of these and future iOS changes.  On engagement, global monthly active users grew 1% year-over-year. We continued to face headwinds, primarily from pandemic easing, as Ben described, but also due to a lower contribution to monthly active user growth from Gen Z users and due to SEO changes that impacted web traffic to our service, particularly in certain emerging international markets.  We remain encouraged by the fact that global mobile app MAUs continue to grow double digits year-over-year. In the U.S., our mobile app MAUs remained relatively resilient when compared to our web-based MAUs, which declined double digits year-over-year.  Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q4. The exact impact of the pandemic and its aftermath on our engagement and revenue remains unknown. On the engagement side, it's worth pausing for a moment to recap our understanding of engagement trends on Pinterest over the last couple of quarters. When lockdowns began to ease last spring, we saw a precipitous drop in some of our core at-home use cases like home decor, cooking and DIY, and they haven't fully recovered yet. When you look at Pinterest today, the propensity to adopt at-home use cases, such as home decor and food and drink, is less than it was before the pandemic began, while the propensity to adopt use cases like beauty and women's fashion has grown. That's what's driving our belief that we're not in a normal environment yet.  As Ben said, we don't believe that this trend reflects a permanent change in human behavior, and we think monthly active users will eventually return to a more normal seasonal growth pattern. While we believe this, the timing is uncertain because the pandemic and subsequent user behavior remains difficult to predict, as evidenced by Q3 monthly active users not following a typical seasonal trend. So we're monitoring this as well as SEO changes and the impact of time spent on competitive platforms as we mentioned last quarter.  In this environment, we continue to build the most inspiring product we can, and we're confident that the investments we're making in native content will be engagement and revenue-accretive in the long term.  Given this context, we think it is most helpful to let you know where we are today. As of Tuesday, November 2, U.S. monthly active users were approximately 89 million, and global monthly active users were approximately 447 million. While the quarter-to-date trend suggests some stabilization of monthly active users, the pandemic unwind has distorted our typical seasonal trends as we saw in Q3, so it's hard to predict exactly how the quarter will play out from here.  On the revenue side, we expect total revenue to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q4 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, the macro environment remains challenging. For our CPG advertisers, supply chain issues are still front and center, and they're not sure when things will improve. Also, it's possible that the macro and supply chain issues will affect other non-CPG verticals more in Q4 than they did during the third quarter.  Second, we're facing tough year-over-year comps this quarter. In the year-ago quarter, our investments in ads automation meaningfully drove year-on-year revenue, we had a very strong Q4 2020 holiday season, and we attracted ad spend for being a positive platform during the social media boycott in the 2020 election.  Third, we continue to monitor the impacts that higher CPAs could have on our more price-sensitive advertisers. There are some exogenous factors that appear to be resulting in higher CPAs, including overall demand for digital ads from advertisers. On Pinterest specifically, if engagement declines continue, we'd eventually expect to see some constraints on our monetizable supply and, in turn, higher CPAs. This is not something we're seeing today, and we are monitoring this dynamic. At the same time, we're investing in a number of opportunities to monetize our existing supply and help advertisers achieve their goals.  Finally, as we scale the distribution of Idea Pins, traffic will increasingly shift to relatively undermonetized surfaces such as Idea Pins streams and our new vertical video, Watch tab. These new surfaces will likely remain under monetized in the medium term as we optimize the user experience to drive engagement. This investment will likely be a modest headwind to revenue in the future quarters, as it was in Q3, and as reflected in our Q4 guide. However, we believe that Idea Pins will be both engagement and revenue-accretive over time.  Finally, I'd like to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, the Pinner experience, advertiser success and shopping. Our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 grew 26% year-over-year. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low-teens percentage basis quarter-over-quarter as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term strategic initiatives and invest in our brand-marketing campaign in the fourth quarter.  Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. And then Ross, I think your -- the second question was about the fourth quarter guide, and I can give a little bit more color on that. So I know folks look at this in a variety of ways. But we often get the question on a stacked growth basis. I think it's in the mid-90s on a CAGR basis over the last couple of years. We're in the mid-40s, which is largely consistent with trend. So I think your point holds there.  The color behind that is we expect that the CPG headwinds, which aren't unique to us, it's an industry-wide phenomenon. I would expect that, that continues through the fourth quarter. The question is whether it broadens beyond CPG, but we haven't seen that yet.  And I mentioned this a little bit before, that we had a lot of really compelling product improvements through our work on automation last year, auto bid, campaign budget optimization and other things that had great results through the year. We had a especially strong holiday season last year, and then we had some election year benefits that persisted beyond Q3 into Q4. So we're lapping that.  And then we're monitoring, as I mentioned, the impact of higher prices on the platform. But the strength is really around our larger retail advertisers, many of whom are buying consideration or traffic objectives right now, continued strength in international and the benefits of our investments in a full funnel performance platform are working. I mean that strategy that we've been talking about for the last couple of years is working, and we're seeing great success with our larger managed mid-market advertisers as a result, which means we're using our monetizable supply more efficiently. Does that answer your question? Ross, at the highest level -- thanks for reminding me about that last bit of your question. I -- we grew the business initially on the back of strength in larger retail and CPG advertisers. And that's been a healthy place for us over the last several years. We've diversified, as you know, into other verticals and deeper into the mid-market, in particular, the larger managed mid-market advertisers, especially as we build out more automation in our ad stack and better serve their objectives.  The arc of diversification has moved away on a secular basis, meaning the mix of non-CPG and retail has improved. We still have a lot of exposure to those 2. And given the strength we saw last quarter in retail, we actually saw that kind of mix back toward retail in some respects. Our larger advertisers showed up in force last quarter. Thanks, Brian. So on the Q4 guide, I would tell you that the guidance reflects what I know through this call about how we're trending into Q4 and what I see in terms of likely demand and delivery through the end of the quarter. So I'll start there.  I'm not trying to communicate anything that nuanced in that message. It's literally a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q3 that I haven't seen abate thus far in the quarter in core CPG -- in the core CPG market. And I'm reading the news as you do every day about supply chain challenges in that part of the market. And I'm not seeing anything that's unique to us at all with respect to their advertising demand.  It harkens back a little bit to what we saw in the initial part of the COVID period where we saw a pullback from CPG and omnichannel retailers who were either sold out or had stores closed. We're kind of in a same similar dynamic in CPG, where advertising, when you can't deliver product, is challenging, and that's not a Pinterest-specific comment. There's nothing that's changed over the last few weeks relative to what we saw in Q3 that I would call out. And the caution I provided about extensions in other industries is just something that is on my mind, but I'm not yet seeing in the quarter. So hopefully, that's a little bit -- there's no -- I'm not trying to communicate anything that's more nuanced than that. Thanks. So a couple of things. One, Ben, I think, went into a fair amount of detail on what we're building around our creator strategy, which when we execute, will bring people back to the platform more frequently and give them a reason not to churn. So I'm excited about that published subscribe aspect and Pinterest-based communities, keeping people on the platform.  All that said, we're in fairly early innings on all that. We just launched our -- a series of products a couple of weeks ago, which are a great start. I think it will take us a few quarters to get that up and running in a way that builds a great ecosystem across the creator community and our user base. And the reason why I think it takes time is, where Ben started, we take a long-term investment philosophy on these big new initiatives.  If you go back to what we did around international audiences and monetization, that was a multiyear effort to localize content, make sure the user experience resonated outside of the U.S. in the same way it does in the U.S. across the world; and make sure that, that advertising opportunity is as robust relative to market sizing, and those places is what we've seen in the U.S. So that has taken us a few years, and we're seeing great success.  And going back to -- yes, I think it was Mark's question around what does that mean? It means we're still opening up more Latin American markets next year, 3 more markets. We'll open up Japan next year as well. And so those things take years to unfold.  The same is true with shopping. It was a two-sided marketplace where we needed dedicated high-intent surfaces for our users to find products, and we needed the merchant community to upload catalogs in a way that would provide at least the opportunity for us to serve the right organic content or promoted content to the right user at the right time relative to that commercial intent.  Our focus was on making sure the user experience work first, and we're now monetizing that shopping experience better and better over time. But our first focus is on making sure the user experience is positive. The same will be true on these Idea Pin creator ecosystem investments we're making. I'm highly confident that will drive session frequency, depths of engagement around rich discovery opportunities. The published subscribed model will bring people back more regularly around interest-based communities, and I think that this will be a terrific platform for shopping over time. But it will take us -- this is not a next quarter, you'll see a turnaround in engagement. This is a longer-term investment for us.  On the Gen Z point, our best belief is that people went back to school in person. And relative to a year ago, that meant they spent less time in that Gen Z community on our platform. We also had -- if you remember a year ago, we had an iOS update, and there's a fair amount of engagement around wallpaper. That was -- I think we called out 4 million users in the third quarter of last year, which was roughly split geographically similar to the way we look at our global audience in terms of impact. And so that was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter. But the biggest thing that we're looking at is people just going back to school and spending less time on Pinterest in that cohort."

            "name": "Benjamin Silbermann",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for joining the call. Todd and I will give a bit more context about the quarter, and then we'll open it up to questions.  I want to just start by saying how grateful I am for our team. In the face of so much uncertainty in the world, we continue to deliver great products for Pinners, creators and businesses. And I'm proud that, despite macro challenges like supply chain shortages, we grew revenue 43% year-over-year to $633 million. That was thanks to increasing demand from larger retail advertisers and growth in our international business. It's another signal that advertisers see different value on Pinterest than in other platforms.  On engagement, monthly active users grew 1% to 444 million as we continue to see the pandemic unwind impact our engagement. While we had an uptick in our core out-of-home use cases, like fashion and beauty, they didn't outweigh the downtick we saw with core in-the-home-use cases a trend that began in March. However, we don't believe this is a permanent change in behavior. Although the timing is hard to predict, we think that MAUs will return to a more normal seasonal growth pattern in the future, as more and more people return to looking for ideas for their homes, recipes, their families and so much more.  In the bigger picture, we think there is growing demand for a positive place on the Internet to discover great ideas, try them and buy them. And that's why we remain focused on building a place that feels healthy and encouraging; a place to envision your best life with rich new tools; and a place that connects you to ideas, businesses and creators to help you turn inspiration into reality.  For a long time, we've talked about helping people make the journey all the way from inspiration to realization, which is why we continued to invest in the core product to make it more shoppable. We've added new features like Slide Show Collections, which allow merchants to easily display more of their products in a full-screen video format. We've expanded our Verified Merchant Program into 7 new markets, including Brazil, Italy and Spain. We've introduced product-tagging and affiliate links for Idea Pins, so creators can help Pinners shop their favorite brands. And these efforts are showing results. Overall product searches were up over 100% year-over-year. searches on the Shop tab by Gen Z were up 200% year-over-year.  In Q4, we started testing a more seamless checkout experience, and so we're excited about the momentum. At the same time, we continue to execute our longer-term creator strategy to evolve how by our Pinners. We believe that our investments in a native creator-driven ecosystem will lead to deeper engagement over time, with Idea Pins accelerating the rich video content on interest, offering new ways to get inspired and giving people new reasons to visit Pinterest more frequently as they find and follow creators their love.  In just the past few weeks, we've released a number of new features to execute on this strategy. A new Watch tab, where folks can watch a vertical feed of full screen Idea Pins; a new feature called Takes, where users can publish their own personal spin and Idea Pins and encourage others to try those same ideas; a new rewards program to pay creators for sharing their passions with their audience; and most recently, Pinterest TV, which offers live original episodes featuring creators.  And this is just the beginning. This is a long-term investment for us into the future of inspiring lifestyle media. So while that's changed in the world over the past 1.5 years, one thing we believe hasn't changed is our value proposition. If people want a place to focus on themselves, not others, define what they truly love, not just what others like and to envision their best selves and to make that future possible. We believe that places Pinterest, and that's why I'm as excited as ever about our future.  Now I'll turn it over to Todd. Thanks for your question, Ross. I'll start by talking about creators, and then Todd will address your second question. So on creators, like maybe just taking a step back, I just want to remind everyone of why we're investing in this in the first place. And there are 2 principal reasons.  The first is that Pinterest is fundamentally about inspiration. We have long inspired people with web-based images, but we think that video is a fundamental format for inspiration in the future. And today, mobile video is really still in its infancy. So you're seeing all these different platforms develop video products that play to their core strengths. Some are about entertainment. Some are about social connection. And at Pinterest, we see this opportunity enable creators to produce videos that are really aligned with what people are there to do on Pinterest, which is get inspired and take action. And so we think that we have a unique value proposition in that space. So one strategic goal is to better deliver on our mission through rich interactive video, and we think this will both deepen engagement over time and drive actions to shop behavior.  The second goal, and you kind of suggest this, is to give our users more reasons to come back to Pinterest with greater frequency. And historically, people mostly come to Pinterest when something in their offline lives needs attention. For example, they might be planning a project for a home remodel or preparing for a seasonal events such as back-to-school. And that means engagement tends to be episodic and driven by events that are exogenous to the service itself.  But on the Internet, when people subscribe to content from their favorite creators and brands, they have more reasons to visit a service and engage more frequently, regardless of what else is happening offline. So integrating this published subscribed model into Pinterest cannot only make the product more inspirational and more useful, but can also meaningfully change engagement.  Look, it's still early days. It's going to take several quarters for these efforts in need of content to kind of meaningfully move the needle. But I'm really proud of the team. We invested significant resources off of kind of more conventional growth investments to build out a new Watch tab, visibility of a tag products; the new feature that we mentioned called Takes; and as you mentioned, most recently, pinches TV. And we're starting to see those efforts getting some momentum. And Idea Pins creator daily grew more than 15x since the beginning of the year. The number of weekly active Idea Pins creators grew 30x, and the time spent on those Pins has been increasing as well.  So all of that is to say we're really optimistic about it. We're going to continue to invest. We consider this a long-term priority, and we tend to go long on the things that we believe in. We did it with shopping. We did it with global expansion and performance advertising and now we're going to deal with online content creation. Sure, Eric. Well, why don't we start with your question on measurement? Look, we've been talking about being prepared for the shifts in the privacy landscape for quite a while. And so for past 3 or 4 quarters now, we talked about investing in first-party measurement.  Now look, we don't believe that in Q3, we saw material results. But over the long term, we think that any loss of signal is not helpful in our effort to provide value to advertisers. And it's just early to tell. The long-term revenue impact of Apple policy changes.  The reason we don't think we've seen as much of an impact is multifold. One is that historically, app install ads, which depend heavily on the usage of IDFA, have not contributed a meaningful amount of revenue. We deprecated that format altogether in 2021, so we didn't have much exposure to the loss of signal.  Number two, because our users often have commercial intent and because our service encourages deep engagement, we do have a rich set of first-party data, and that makes us relatively less dependent on third-party signals to serve highly relevant ads. And so we think our models have been pretty resilient to the loss of offsite data.  And then finally, as I mentioned at the top, we've been investing in our ad tech stack just to improve conversion visibility in a privacy-centric solutions. So that's kind of the mix.  I think 1 area that we want to continue investing in, honestly, because it makes the product better for users, is more and more seamless checkout. And that's another area where, over time, as we see more traction there, it will sort of help dampen effects of some of those privacy changes. So that's sort of the first part of your question.  Your second question is a little bit more about how we're thinking about the company strategically and how we're positioned. And I don't want to read between the lines, but maybe one question people are asking is, how you feel as a stand-alone business? And I would say -- and I think that Pinterest is really well positioned for a few reasons. First, this is a significant audience that's coming to Pinterest for a really differentiated use case, right? They're not coming to connect with friends. They're actually coming to envision their future, to plan for it. And increasingly, we're enabling them to take action by acting to the retailers and the products that can turn those inspiration into a reality. That's a pretty unique value proposition, and it's also a very differentiated brand position. We try to invest heavily to make sure that interest remains a positive and inspiring place to both content safety measures, but also through policies which protect that ability for people to envision that positive future.  Second, Pinterest sits at this really interesting intersection of a few trends that are really secular growth trends in the industry. One, as you mentioned, is commerce. And the part of commerce that large online players, say an Amazon are really great at, are showing you products that you already knew you wanted. But when it comes to taste and shopping, things like furniture, clothing, things where esthetics really matter, people are looking for better tools. And Pinterest is the one place where they're growing their express suite to say things that resonate, to explore possibilities across brands and across retailers. I think that puts us in a great position. It's a competitive space, but I think that the most important thing is that we have users coming with that specific intent, and then we're working hard to fill in the gaps in that experience through our shopping solutions.  And then finally, look, the newest investment is an investment in a creator ecosystem in online video. I said it before, but I think online video and mobile video, it's still in its infancy. You're going to see verticalization happen over time. I think Pinterest is really well positioned to pioneer new media formats to do both inspiration but also allow creators to facilitate action, providing different revenue models for them in the future. So that's what's underlaid our strategy for the last couple of years. We've been pretty transparent about it.  And it's been great to see progress about challenging the form of more shopping conversions; increasing traction with our new creator suite, which really just went to market towards the end of October; and just really positive sentiment from our users about Pinterest being the place that they go to, to feel inspired and to plan really important parts of their life. Brian, on your question of how do we think about shopping engagement on the platform, how many folks are searching and kind of what's going on there. We don't disclose the specifics of the engagement breakdown. But what I can tell you is that search is one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on the platform in general.  And what we try to do in our philosophy in shopping is to make it so any place that you're feeling inspired, we want to make it seamless for you that it connects to a shopping surface. So in search, that means that we'll surface products. And then if you scroll down, you can see related products. Those are shopping surfaces. And over time, there's a lot of opportunity to grow the number of shopping ads within those surfaces. When you're just searching generally, we make it easier and easier for you to find individual retailers. That's been a big push by the team this year.  And even when we talk about new inspirational services, our long-term plan is to connect those to shopping as well. So we talked a little bit about Idea Pins and Pinterest TV, and we want to make sure that experience is great. But a lot of people want to do there is they want to eventually buy the things they see. And so we'll be experimenting ways to connect Idea Pins and Story Pins into those shopping services.  Our goal at all times is to make sure that Pinterest feels inspirational. No one wants to feel like products are being shut down in a road, but at the same time, to make it really easy for you to pivot from that moment of inspiration when you see that perfect scene, where you see that perfect product and make it seamless for you eventually buy it. And so it just started to experiment with some of the seamless checkout work in partnership with a couple of folks, including Shopify in Q4, we're helping them learn. That's just an early pilot. But again, it's about shortening the path from inspiration to purchase without disrupting the user experience at the same time. Sure, Rich. I'll start with your second question first. And I think it's really about like are we continuing to evolve the user experience to keep up with changing user expectations and changing behavior patterns? And the answer is absolutely yes. So we launched a set of features in October 20. For the first time, we provide things like the Watch tab, which is sort of an immersive vertical strolling format. We think that's certain customers who become really accustomed to. And we think we can provide that format and then we can differentiate the type of content that really aligns to what Pinners are there to do. And so that's just 1 example.  But you'll be seeing us rolling out more and more new experiences that are all sort of principally designed to make it easy to be both kind of browse and inspiration, go deep when they want to and eventually purchase the things they're looking for. So you're right, you're right to ask, and our teams are hard at work in building the changes. I'm really excited actually to get them in front of more users. That just started to roll out all over the world.  Your first question was, why don't we make more money? Why is your ARPU is still low? And I would say -- let me say a few things. First of all, I'm actually enormously proud of the team. We are growing revenue really significantly. And we talked before about a few different significant opportunities that we see for further revenue growth.  The first is international. So we continue to scale international revenue. We're opening up new geographies, and we're getting faster and faster at rolling out products such as shopping that are developed in the U.S. into markets that are earlier in the maturity. And we think that's a big driver of ARPU because, as you know, a lot of our users are outside the United States.  Second, we have a couple of high-intent surfaces that are not that monetized today. And one of the most important is shopping. And what we've been doing is really trying to build more automated ways to bring in more and more inventory. So we talked about catalog uploading. We've also added an API, so we can get more and more products there.  The thing about the shopping services to remember is that relevance really matters, and what underpins relevance is the scale and the structure of the catalog. So that's been a long-term investment, and we're excited to keep driving that. If on top of that, we then reduce the friction in checkout, we think there's a really significant opportunity there ahead. And look, we're working hard. And I'm really pleased with the progress that we're seeing.  The final thing is that the team -- the ads product team has really grown the efficiency of our ads by leaps and downs. Todd mentioned it just briefly, but we've been on this path to improve automation in a number of different firms. They can pay budget optimization as one of the most recent innovations that we've seen really amazing returns on. We've seen advertisers see 20% to 30% lower cost per click, which signals to us that we can give more value to those advertisers, and we think that is a good thing.  As that automation gets adopted by some of our larger advertisers, we think it gives an opportunity to democratize those tools for some of the midsized and smaller advertisers over time. So that's the third opportunity for growth. So I get the question, and we're working hard to grow a great business, and I think we have a lot of really great opportunities ahead of us. Well, I'll let Todd expand on it more. I mean I think improvements in things like automation, improvements in ad formats and measurement, those are things that are kind of always driving better and better efficiencies. And I don't think that we've exhausted all those opportunities. And so we continue to work on that.  International, we're investing pretty significantly, and Todd can speak more about new markets that we're opening. We're building out operational teams there. I think farthest away are probably the monetization of Idea Pins and Idea Streams. Those are brand-new experiences. And what we like to do is really get those experiences working well. And we're willing to take a hit on short-term revenue to make sure that users are having a great experience and then find out how to fold in the right monetization opportunities over time.  So Todd mentioned that, that may be a headwind in the coming quarters. That's true, but I also think it's an intentional choice. We want to make sure that we're giving creators clear guidance on how to build the most inspiring content. We're growing our ability to show the right content to the right person, so people feel like they're getting information relevant to them. When those things are established and are driving engagement, we'll find bright ways to add revenue. We're beta testing idea ads. We're beta testing, some really interesting partnerships with brands and creators, but I wouldn't expect those to be big revenue contributors in the short term. Thanks, Mark. I think it's a great question. I mentioned it at the top, but unlike more social service where you engage with it almost daily to talk to your friends, Pinterest is something that you might come in, use it for a product, a project and then you may pause. And historically, we've seen a lot of our users use it for a period of time and then come back.  Two answers to that. One is that we can do a better job at reengaging those users. And so we're continuing to invest in things like the taste graph and better personalization, which will enable us to do that more and more efficiently, and this is ongoing work to do it really well.  The second answer, and this is longer term, is we'd love for folks actually continue using it from the getgo. And so part of the reason why we're excited about building more published subscribed model is that people can find creators that resonate with them and visit the service more frequently. And again, we're early on in that. But think of those as the 2 approaches. Like one is resurrecting folks by showing them use cases that are relevant in doing that by improving the quality of our personalization and the quality of outreach. And the second, not letting people lapse in the first place because we connect them with creators and use cases that really resonate, and that keeps them using the service more and more often to do more and more different things in their lives. Well, I just want to thank everyone again for joining and for all the thoughtful questions. I want to thank again the Pinterest team for another quarter of great work. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going, and enjoy the rest of your day or your evening."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Ms. Penner, the floor is yours.\nJane Penner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest's earnings call for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. I'm Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Joining me today on the call are Ben Silbermann, Pinterest's President and CEO; and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations.  Now I'll cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q3 2021 are preliminary and are not an indication of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and letter to shareholders, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com.  And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Thank you, Jane. Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. I'm going to talk for a few minutes, and then Todd will follow up with some additional insight, and then we'll open up for questions. Earlier today, we released our latest shareholder letter. As you've seen, we grew revenue faster than expected. And at the same time, we saw a decrease in engagement as stay-at-home orders eased around the world. I want to discuss each in turn.  Starting with revenue. Revenue increased 125% year-over-year to $613 million. We saw more and more advertisers here in the U.S. and increasingly across the globe recognize the value we offer in connecting them with people planning for their lives. It's a clear signal that our investments in shopping, automation and tools are working. And we plan to continue investing to make it easier for advertisers to scale and reach new customers on Pinterest.  On the user growth front, we grew globally monthly active users 9% year-over-year. And I'm sure there are questions about this, so I thought I'd take a few of the obvious ones head on.  The first question is what happened with user behavior? As we all know, the pandemic was an unprecedented and unique global event. In past earnings calls, we talked about how stay-at-home orders significantly increased usage of Pinterest. And for the past year, we've highlighted how people came to Pinterest for inspiration to reinvent their lives during such a difficult time.  Now as the world opens up, we're seeing the similar effect in the opposite direction. That impacted our growth, particularly because some of the core use cases we see on our platform are less common in 2021 than they were a year ago. That shift in behavior in Q2 impacted engagements.  Which brings me to the second question, what users did this impact the most? Well, most of the difference between what we guided and what we reported are people who came to Pinterest from the web versus from mobile apps. These users tended to be, on average, less engaged and generated less revenue than people who came directly to Pinterest.  In contrast, in Q2, monthly active users on our mobile apps grew in the U.S. year-over-year and internationally by more than 20%. We're continuing to closely monitor Pinner engagement. So later, Todd will talk you through more about what we've learned a few weeks into our current quarter.  While we navigate the current volatility caused by COVID, we remain focused on building for the long term. Pinterest is at the beginning of a fundamental transition, going from a place [Technical Difficulty] lifestyle expertise in the form of rich interactive videos. We're doing this in a number of ways. First, Idea Pins are our first publishing tool, enabling creators to share ideas with lasting value. Second, the creator code is our initiative to make sure Pinterest remains a positive and supportive environment. And third, we'll be adding new features to help creators foster community. We intend to go beyond likes and comments, and we'll build tools that let people share their creations, ask and answer questions and offer encouragement and share tips. We're still early in this transition, but those early results are positive.  The number of Idea Pins created daily has grown more than sevenfold since the beginning of the year. More and more, creators are publishing ideas and opening up new worlds on Pinterest on everything from outfit ideas, school activities, workout routines and vacation ideas. And Idea Pins are resonating with our fastest-growing audience, Gen Z. This audience grew double digits year-over-year. We plan to continue to execute on this strategy with more product launches like product tagging, which came out this week to help reward creators for their work and get Pinners another way to go from inspiration to purchase till later this year, when we make it possible for all Pinners to create Idea Pins as well as many more capabilities. For us, these aren't just a series of one-off moves; rather they add up to a larger vision on how we intend to pursue our mission. It has to do something we believe Pinterest is uniquely positioned to do: to tie together the lifestyle inspiration you've seen on TV with the positivity and enjoyment that comes with being part of a community of shared interests with the utility that comes from great planning and shopping tools. Creators are an important building block fulfilling our mission of giving everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Todd for his thoughts.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in Q2 and provide a preliminary outlook for Q3. As noted in our shareholder letter, fewer monthly active users came to Pinterest in Q2 than we expected. Ben's remarks on the letter detail why we think this happened. But in summary, we believe that nearly all of what we're seeing now is the unwinding of some of the engagement benefits that we got during an unprecedented period of time when people were stuck at home and had more time to spend on some of our core use cases.  We also continue to monitor other factors, including competition and the impact of Google's recent search algorithm changes while continuing to improve our product and ramp up our marketing efforts to increase engagement over time. We're encouraged that our most engaged monthly active users, those that use our mobile applications, grew year-over-year, both in the U.S. and globally. These users contributed a significant majority of both total impressions and total revenue in Q2. Additionally, the investments we've been making to more efficiently realize value from the unique existing engagement we have is working well. Specifically, the engagement we have on shopping services appears to be more resilient than overall engagement. We plan to continue investing in helping Pinners shop for products they love at a price point they want and in helping merchants get discovered and connected to people who will love their products and services.  While we're still early in the journey to fully monetize our shopping engagement, we believe that we have the right sales coverage model, and we're delivering conversions to advertisers who are seeking sales on the platform.  Looking beyond the COVID-19-driven volatility, our view on the long-term opportunity to grow our user base, both in the U.S. and globally, is unchanged from what it was before the pandemic.  Turning to our financial performance. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 125%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%. This remarkable growth was propelled by 2 main drivers. First, we saw momentum from large advertisers, especially retailers, who returned to the platform in force as consumers resumed social activity when pandemic restrictions leaves. Other going out subverticals like beauty and travel also returned to strength in Q2. Second, our international business again performed really well, growing 227% year-over-year in Q2 and contributing 22% of total revenue. Both of these trends show the growth and diversification of our active advertiser base, which grew both sequentially and year-over-year.  Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q3. The engagement headwinds we observed in Q2 have continued in July. As of Tuesday, U.S. monthly active users have declined approximately 7% and global monthly active users have grown approximately 5% year-over-year. The evolution of COVID-19 and pandemic restrictions remain unknown, and we're not providing guidance on Q3 2021 monthly active users, given our lack of visibility into certain key drivers of engagement, which could continue to play out for a few quarters. On the revenue side, we expect total revenue to grow in the low 40s on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q3 revenue guide takes into account a few things: first, Ben talked about the important transition we're making from being a place where people view static images safe from the web to the place where people go to discover the best native immersive lifestyle content. That's a big behavior change for us. To build a new ecosystem for creators, we have to invest, and that means giving distribution to Idea Pins at the expense of some high-value advertising inventory, which impacts revenue. We believe that in the long term, this strategy will be engagement accretive and that we'll have a significant opportunity to monetize that engagement. [Technical Difficulty] through the course of the year and in Q3.  There was a big rebound in ad spend during the quarter as large CPG and retail advertisers reengaged after the initial shock of COVID, and we believe we benefited from being a positive platform during the social media boycott amidst the 2020 election cycle.  Finally, we're carefully monitoring the impact of increasing prices on the platform. These increases are consistent with our strategy to grow our advertiser base, increase auction density and deliver ads more efficiently over time, but that may increase the churn for some price-sensitive advertisers whose cost per action has increased.  Before opening it up for questions, I also want to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, the Pinner experience, advertiser success and shopping. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 51% year-over-year, driven in part by our brand marketing campaign. We increased our head count 21% year-over-year, our third quarter of sequential acceleration. We expect sequential non-GAAP operating expenses to grow modestly in Q3 as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term strategic initiatives and growth drivers and resume our brand marketing campaign again in early Q4.  Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: One for Ben, one for Todd. Ben, you mentioned in the letter and just now some of these at-home categories where MAUs or use cases are kind of dropping off, which makes sense, given where we are on the reopening. But just, I guess, can you just -- since we haven't talked about this before, maybe kind of break down these use cases into how much of the behavior is around the home versus other things? And is it relegated -- or is the drop-off solely in those areas? Or is there something kind of more systemic going on?  And then, Todd, the 2Q numbers are obviously outstanding. The low 40s, I think, is a little bit lower than we had thought and there's probably some conservatism in there. So is that what you're describing around this swapping out the ads for the creator pins? Or any more color on what you're seeing thus far in 3Q from your large retail and CPG clients? And do you think the 2-year stack should hold at this level that you're talking about with the 40% in 3Q on a go-forward basis?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. I can start with your first one, which was a little bit more color on the changes in user behavior that we're seeing. And as Todd outlined, there are a few things that are changing as the pandemic is eased. One, overall time at home has shifted. And two, a lot of the use cases that were especially relevant last year, things like redecorating your home, educating your kid at home, cooking meals at home, those have lessened. Now it's early to say how those will normalize over time. I wouldn't describe the current user behavior or the current social environment exactly the same, but we're seeing some promising early signs. We're looking at things like back-to-school, we're seeing an uptick in fashion. And as mentioned, we continue to see strength in areas like Gen Z, which engage and continue to be our fastest-growing demographic. I don't know if that starts to answer your question. Todd, I'm not sure if you want to add any more color there.\nTodd Morgenfeld: No, I think that's great, Ben. Ross, why don't I take the second part of your question, which I tried to talk about a little bit in my prepared remarks, but I'll pause and double-click on it a little bit. I think you are interested in the impact of our creator and content ecosystem and particularly the distribution of Idea Pins. There were really 3 reasons that were -- 3 factors that are kind of influencing that low 40s guide. From a quantification perspective, it's difficult to pin down exact numbers, but 3 things are in my head when informing that guide. The first is we are building out a content and creator ecosystem with our Idea Pin format. That will require some investments to get up and running.  There are things around that, around pivoting people from the grid format to streaming experiences, consuming some of our highest value ad slot inventory to distribute those Idea Pins. And the cold start issue because we don't have enough content yet, relevance is a bit of a challenge until we get this marketplace, this content marketplace in effect. So it is an investment in the long-term engagement and growth potential of the company to use some of that supply to distribute Idea Pins. We believe that, that will be accretive to engagement longer term, and we know and have talked about in the past that we've already seen some evidence we can monetize that format. I'm confident that given the short-form video nature of that content and our enormous success in scaling video advertising over time that we'll find similar success with these creator efforts. I might remind folks that we went through a similar exercise with shopping over the last couple years where we made an investment in the user experience first to find product market fit before we put our foot on the gas around monetizing.  And I view this similarly: we're investing in the user experience to get this content marketplace up and running with Idea Pins on the belief that with the right product market fit, we'll drive organic engagement and be able to follow with monetizable [Technical Difficulty] self-explanatory and we went through it in detail on the call, the Q3 call from last year. But the impact of high returning automation through the course of 2020, the big rebound in CPG in retail and the benefits to us of not being a social media platform during the social media boycotts during a contentious election cycle last year makes for a pretty tough comp in Q3.  And then as I mentioned, we're out looking at the things that are on strategy for us, which is diversifying our advertiser base, delivering more auction pressure, driving more cost per action on the platform, and that may cause some rotation amongst our most price-sensitive advertisers. But advertisers value the commercial intent we bring, they value our demographic and they value our brand safety narrative. And for those advertisers, we're continuing to see tremendous success. But we're in an escalating pricing environment that may squeeze out those that are -- that value some of those characteristics less. And so those are the things that are on my mind as we guide to the low 40s for the quarter. Does that make sense?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one, yes, I understand there'll be a lot of questions about users. Maybe just to give us a little more clarity. Can you just tell us what percentage of the U.S. or the global users are part of that app user base? Just so we can sort of better understand the magnitude of some of the dynamics you're talking about, app users versus web users.  And then secondly, I think in the past, you talked about your new initiatives like Lat Am, APAC and native checkout. Maybe just talk to us about where you are on sort of those three growth areas.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. So on the user base question, Brian, our mobile app users contribute a significant majority of our total impressions, they're higher frequency and therefore, they deliver a significant majority of our revenue. If you look globally, and there are a lot of ways to cut this. But one way we think about it is globally about 75% of our users are mobile users. And a large majority of those users are mobile app users, so that dimensionalizes it to some extent. Now these web users that come in not on the mobile app are important to us because they're upper funnel user acquisition, right? They're not heavy consumers of impressions or big delivery of near-term revenue, but they do inform growth potential over time. So they're important to us, just not as important to the near-term revenue performance of the company.  Folks may remember a couple of years ago in, I think it was the second quarter of 2018, we had some external factors that impacted user growth, but continue to grow our revenue right through those engagement issues, and it's a similar dynamic that we saw last quarter. And apologies. Can I -- can you please repeat your second question?\nBrian Nowak: It's all good. Yes. Just sort of looking for any update on timing of some of the new growth initiatives you talked about in the past like native checkout, Latin America expansion on the monetization side and then APAC on the incremental website side or incremental app side.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. So on the native checkout side, I think we said last quarter that we were planning to begin testing at some point this year in less friction filled or friction-free way for our users to buy what they found on Pinterest, which is one of our big request from our users. How do I buy what that sounds on Pinterest? And we've enabled that over time, but we're making it even easier for people to do that as a result of some of these tests that are on track for later this year.  Our investments in Latin America are early. We've got a great team in place. The early returns are scaling nicely. We're building great relationships. It's working, but it's still incredibly early. We just launched a couple of months ago in Brazil and Mexico. And while I'm really encouraged by the user base that we have down there and the market opportunity, it's still very early, and that will continue to scale over time.  And then lastly, we're investing in growing our user base in some markets in Asia Pacific that we think we could open up over time, but that's not on the road map for this year yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rich Greenfield from LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: I guess, just from a high level, a couple of housekeeping points maybe just first, just because I think there's -- just to make sure everyone is on the same page. When you're saying U.S. DAU is down 7% so far in the quarter, I believe that just makes U.S. DAUs effectively flat sequentially. And on an international basis, those subs would actually be up sequentially. Just wanted to make sure we're all reading that properly in terms of what the interpretation is. Could you just also give us a sense of how many -- Idea Pin seems to be such a focus of what Ben and sort of the product team are working on. Is there any way to think about what percentage of your MAUs globally are interacting even -- or U.S. or globally, whichever the best way to look at it is, are interacting with Idea Pins at this point?  And then just sort of the main question, just when I think about sort of the comment that's in the letter of advertisers being driven by the adoption of measurement solutions, was wondering if you could sort of give a little bit finer detail of what you actually mean? Like what is attracting advertisers into Pinterest based on your measurement solutions? Like what are you actually seeing? If you could give us a couple of concrete examples where that's actually making a difference?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. Why don't I take the first and third, and Ben may take the second. [Technical Difficulty] I think users rather than DAUs. And we are -- as you mentioned, we're down through Tuesday, about 7% on a year-over-year basis, those are preliminary numbers. I think we're just trying to get some direction post the end of the quarter to show some updated trends.\nRichard Greenfield: But they're not notably flat sequentially?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, if it were to hold. I think that's right. If it were to hold through the quarter. What I would want to caution folks -- so yes, that math is correct. But it implies that we stay current at these levels, which is something I didn't want to lead people to believe on this call because I don't have enough visibility into how these pandemic restrictions easing or any other pandemic-related changes in user behavior may play out because it's been very difficult to discern.  We look at -- just for color commentary on this, we look at pretty detailed time series analysis. We've looked at historical seasonality, and we've done using third-party analysis based on time spent at home to correlate usage against what we see as mobility data in geographies where we have users. And so our best judgment right now, just given the volatility is to give the update on where we are in July, because our experience in forecasting recently has been a little off of where it was historically, if that makes sense. So yes, there's a lot of words to say, yes, your math is correct, but I would caution people that we're not guiding to this Q3 end results at this point, given the uncertainty around the pandemic. Does that make sense?\nRichard Greenfield: It does.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Okay. And then on the advertiser side, we've made -- part of the value of being on Pinterest, and we hear this from advertisers a lot, they love the brand safety and the inspiration that the platform brings. They love the early commercial intent that our user base brings to the platform because you're looking for ideas to bring into your life. And a lot of the activity is unbranded when people come. They're looking -- they don't yet know what they want, but they're effectively shopping. They're looking for new ideas, considering those ideas and eventually purchasing them.  So the value of being out in front, and we've demonstrated this with our delivery of insights over the last couple of years tied to seasonal moments where we can see consumer behavior before it unfolds and help our advertisers design campaigns against those seasonal moments. That speaks to the value of an earlier touch. And the industry has been conditioned on last click analysis for a long time. So a lot of our marketing and sales work is designed to prove that earlier touch is where you want to be when you're diversifying your spend for consumer Internet advertising.  Tools like our Pinterest conversion analysis, conversion insights, which looks at the GMV delivered by organic and promoted shopping behavior and then our Pinterest conversion lift tool. These are all innovations that we've delivered over the last several quarters, couple of years to better demonstrate the value of longer attribution windows and that earlier touch. And so those are the things that we've delivered. But this is part of our go-to-market and our marketing program in general is demonstrating the value of inspiration on the platform, demonstrating the value of insights that we can uniquely glean from our consumer behavior and help show increasingly the value of that earlier touch for those that are willing to consider that as a factor in their spend. Does that make sense?\nRichard Greenfield: It does.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Okay. And then I don't know, Ben, if you had thoughts on the Idea Pins question.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure, Rich. So I think your question was kind of like how many people are seeing these Idea Pins? Where are we in that journey? And I think it's probably worth just taking a moment to visit like why we're going through, why we're describing it as a big transition.  Today, the much of Pinterest content is based on users' pinning items for the web, and it's creating enormous value for businesses, enormous value for people looking for ideas. And over the last few years, we've told you about increasing importance of video content, which has grown significantly. And Idea Pins are the next logical step because they not only enable people to save a video, but they enable creators to produce original content that's aligned with our unique brand and purpose, which is inspiring useful ideas that encourage people to try something new.  But as Todd mentioned, that's a new user behavior. And so the reason we say it's early is because we're going to get our Pinner community used to the idea of following and subscribing creators. And on the flip side, we're going to empower creators with not only publishing tools, ways to engage that audience and eventually to make a living. We think there's an enormous opportunity there because while there's a lot of long-form video and there's a ton in short-form entertainment video, there isn't as much in the type of things that Pinterest specializes in, which are inspiring ideas, ideas that have durable value and ultimately, ideas that can drive action. So we're really excited about that. And the early results are really promising.  So in Q2, we launched Idea Pin, that is the ability to publish them in 22 markets to those with a business account. We have not yet released it to everybody on Pinterest. So if you don't have a business account, you can't yet create Idea Pins, but that will be coming. But already, Idea Pin's created daily. It's grown more than 7x. And on the user side, we're seeing really good adoption with daily impressions growing more than 10x since January. So this is going to be a big shift for the company.  As Todd mentioned, we're really leaning into it, investing. Investing in helping these traders build a community. But over the long term, we think they can change Pinterest from a passive experience where you're browsing imagery to one where you're following people. And we also think that it can bolster all of our other initiatives around not only giving people inspiration, but helping them take action by letting them purchase the things that they've seen.\nRichard Greenfield: Are there milestones that people should be judging you on in this transition as you think about this rollout?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. I mean I think that the first step, Rich, is we're really going to make it much more broadly available. And we're going to make it so people encounter creators and Idea Pins a lot more often. And that's really the first phase, and we're focused on helping these creators build a community. And that's the first phase. And then we're going to build out from there. So that's how we're approaching it internally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: A couple, if I may. Ben, just to kind of follow on, on the creator point. It seems like every platform is kind of focused on the creator economy. And so can you share a little bit more details on like who these creators are? Are they already on the platform? And this is about empowering them to do more? Or attracting new types of creators?  And then for Todd, can you provide a bit more color on that shopping behavior and what it looks like? I think you mentioned at the top of the call that it's been more resilient. But wondering if there's any more color you can share around whether it's product searches to the shopping tab or what it might be?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. I'll start, Mark, with this question of who the creators are. I mean I think it starts with like what's our mission and our unique place as a platform. Pinterest has always been a place that provides lifestyle inspiration, things where people aren't there just to get in their team. They're also there to do something. And we're focused on short form. And so that means there are a lot of creators that exist on the platform but there are also creators where other platforms that are focused more on pure entertainment aren't serving their needs as directly. And so we've seen a lot of really interesting early kind of creator success, things that are core to our use cases but are expressed in a much more engaging way. Make him breakfasts, work outs, cleanup products for a glow up.  And just to put a point on it, one example is a fashion photographer who's been in the early beta. His name is Shane. He's cultivated an audience of 18,000, average 9 million monthly views in only a few months. And what he does is he uses these Idea Pins to take Pinners kind of behind the scenes at fashion shoots and share tips how to succeed as a young entrepreneurial photographer, creative ideas. And what he says is that Pinterest is allowing him to connect with his audience or his community on a deeper level that's harder for him to reach on other platforms. Part of that is because of its search engine-like nature. People are actively looking to churn. Internally, we call that kind of intent. And then the feedback that he's received, he describes as really breathtaking. And so he's excited about cultivating the audience that's more intentful versus browsing, more inspiring or entertaining person after another.  So that's kind of the character. We think there are a lot that are on the platform that haven't had the publishing tools. We're focused on that. We think there are a lot of outside the platform, and we're eager to bring them on and give them the best tools to inspire their community and eventually make a living from it.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So on the shopping question, I'll go into a couple of things. Number one, we've continued to invest in the product experience. And so that's shown where our ability to deliver more inventory has continued to increase. We've delivered 50% more sequentially in terms of product inventory through catalog uploads in Q2 versus Q1. We've rolled out shopping features to Australia, Canada, France and Germany. We launched shopping list which is a way for Pinners to save product pins in 1 place for easy shopping and enable notifications when price drops on, say, product pins. And these are all in service of creating a better shopping experience that we talked about. Those through early tests show that our Pinners are 7x more likely to buy products they've saved.  As we talked about earlier, we're also launching the -- we're testing a plan to test that on platform transaction experience later this year. But to the most direct way of talking about it and the thing that we had, like, pointed to in terms of shopping behavior was our weekly shoppers in the U.S. was more performant than our overall monthly active users. They're about flat year-over-year versus down a few points. Does that answer your questions?\nMark Shmulik: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions. One is nitty-gritty, and one's bigger picture. The nitty-gritty one is that update you gave on MAUs, could you also do that for the mobile, the really engaged MAUs? What those trends look like through the quarter to date, both globally and in the U.S.? I.e. is there -- or U.S. MAUs declining year-over-year, but that whatever that 5% to 7%, but the hard quarter, your mobile ones rising, any comment there?  And then secondly, just step back a little bit and just talk about with COVID, what impact do you think -- that clearly created this kind of comp issue for you, we get that. But talk about if there were wins, and I think you probably had some sustainable wins, you probably had a large cohort of users who came on and have permanently stayed on with you. So just talk about the kind of the what you saw from that COVID cohort. I think at the time, you talked about this a year ago, those engagement trends were relatively similar to what you had seen in prior or maybe even greater. So just talk about all those users that came in. What trends do you think you saw from those that are sustainable?\nTodd Morgenfeld: So Mark, I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Ben comment a little bit on some of the user behavior that we've seen. I don't have an update through Tuesday on the mobile app MAUs, but what we saw last quarter was they were modestly positive year-over-year in the U.S. and grew about roughly 20% globally. And so that gives you some sense, but I didn't update them through Tuesday and don't have them to share on this call.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Mark, the second question was what have we observed about folks that joined during COVID, what's the same and what's different. So the things that are the same are we continue to see that these core lifestyle verticals, fashion, food, beauty, health, they continue to be really important. And while coming from last year to this year, the overall usage is lower. We think those are durable things. Those are things that people care about and they're going to continue to care about. And so in terms of progress, we continue to invest to make sure those experiences, including making all those experiences more shoppable, continue to be really great.  One interesting thing that we have noticed is that we continue to see Gen Z grow on Pinterest. So the U.S. monthly attributes [Technical Difficulty] women's fashion. But it's a really exciting early trend. And it's one that we're really excited to cater to because it's obviously a future demographic that will grow into an incredibly valuable cohort in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Maybe one for Ben. When you take a step back and you look at 91 million DAUs in the quarter versus 85 two years ago, how do you feel about your progress kind of getting new demographics on the site? And where do you think you can go from here? I mean you still have aspirations of maybe getting 150 million users. How are you thinking about really driving growth in new demographics from here?  And then I guess on the catalog, really interesting growth there, 50% quarter-over-quarter. Can you just help us understand what that puts up on the advertising side? And does that put you in a better position for shopping on the site? How you're thinking about that?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure, Justin. So I think at a high level, you're asking where do we think that future growth is going to come from. And we've covered a little bit new demographics that are going. But maybe one way to interpret it is what are the functionalities? How is the platform improving to be more useful to more people at the time? I think that we covered at some length on why we think the creators, while a long-term initiative is pretty fundamental. If you think about large-scale consumer Internet platforms, you have social platforms, and then you have a long list of ones that have some form of publish and subscribe, when you can follow people to create content. And usually, that's video content. Pinterest is somewhat unique in that it's grown as a utility where you browse and look at content. And so we're introducing something that we think that our users are really looking for, our users tell us that they want a place where they can browse video content, they can follow inspiring people who really major in expertise and lifestyle and minor in celebrity and entertainment rather than the other way around. And so we're really excited about that long-term prospect.  On the flip side of that, you have utility, like how useful is Pinterest at helping you go from inspiration to actually a purchase. And there, we've made tremendous progress. A year or 2 ago, one of the most common user concerns was that I would see an image, I would want to purchase it, but I couldn't reliably get there. But a lot of investments we've made from increasing the amount of products uploaded through catalogs, to better ways to pivot from an image or a video to products and interrelated products and then to a brand page, to future things like the shopping list that we leased, test to needed checkout, make Pinterest itself more and more useful for taking us on a full journey from inspiration all the way to purchase.  So I think both of these things are long-term tailwinds. I also do believe we're still early days in terms of international growth and expansion. And so we're going to continue to invest there. And I think there's a lot of great future growth to be had.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And then, Justin, I think the second part of your question was about the impact of the 50% sequential increase in catalogs on the platform. I think around a little bit to say, you may remember this little echo of some of the conversations we've had over the last few quarters, but I'll remind folks that similar to how I kicked off the call, we're majoring in the user experience and product market fit with respect to shopping. So our investments in catalog ingestion were designed to improve the inventory of shoppable content we have available to us to deliver and then marry that with better access to natural high-intent discovery services for our users to find that content in a natural journey from inspiration to purchase.  The catalog ingestion success that we've had really improved the first of those, the inventory available to us to deliver products to users that match their aesthetic from a retailer that they trust at an appropriate price point. And so we have seen nice growth in our shopping revenue, consistent with that product market fit that's still developing and improving as advertisers see the value of promoting the shopping content that our users are increasingly engaging in. So that is, hopefully, that's a little bit better, helpful color on how I think about the catalog piece. Our availability of shopping content means that we have a bunch of potential content to promote for advertisers who are seeing that GMV success on the platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just wanted to circle back to the 3Q revenue. Just trying to understand the low 40s growth better. Just as you're shifting from static images to more Idea Pins, can you help us quantify the impact there at all in terms of dollars? And how do we rationalize that just with the comments that mobile users are still growing overall and that they monetize better?  And then separately, is there any risk as you go through this transition? Is there any risk to users and engagement just as you shift the user experience more to Idea Pins over these next few or several quarters?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, I can kick off with the guidance piece, and then maybe Ben can talk about these or the second part of your question. The way I think about it is we do have highly engaged mobile app users where we drive the bulk of our revenue. But for those users as we pivot and introduce the creator ecosystem and more Idea Pins, there are a couple of things we're doing even with those users, right? We're pivoting them from a grid format to a streaming format that consumes some of the time they would have spent on the platform.  We're using some of our highest value add slots for those users, and we're replacing them with Idea Pins. So the distribution is coming in place of known economic return [Technical Difficulty] find that it's a compelling way to go from idea to action.  We're also evaluating this relevance question. We've talked a lot about how diversifying our advertiser base is important because we want to increasingly deliver ads that feel like content to users. In this particular area with Idea Pins without an abundance of content, relevance is challenging to get up and running. And so that has some implications for engagement as people have a less than satisfying experience on site. So these are all things that we know we will deal with as we get this marketplace, this content marketplace up and running. But I wanted to be clear about how I was thinking about it. It's an investment in monetizable supply to get that content marketplace up and running and successful, that we think is the right long-term investment for the company.  It's unclear how the adoption rates will go. Some of it's within our control to some extent, too, how it unfolds. But I wanted to give you my best judgment of where we're headed based on my current assessment of road map, what we're seeing in the quarter and where we're heading. Does that make sense?\nDouglas Anmuth: It does.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Okay. And then on the user experience, I don't know, Ben, if you wanted to add any color?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Well, I think we've covered it. I think the important thing to understand is that we are introducing a new user experience. And we had a large-scale service, it takes some getting used to. But there are a few things that I think are really encouraging and really will cater to the unique nature of the platform. One is where we've seen a lot of Idea Pins be successful early are items that have utility. And so as people add more content, that begins to fill up a content corpus that has long-lasting value. So it's not a highlight of today's party, it might be a recipe you can cook, an outfit that you can try on, a new way to style something, a new workout. And so over time, as more and more of these Idea Pins are generated, we have a larger and larger body of pins to recommend. That increases relevance. And it helps people find those 1 or 2 creators that really connect with their interests.  The other thing I would say is that historically, we have and we continue to be focused on the long term. We took a really long bet, as Todd mentioned, on shopping. And we had a very similar dynamic where we had to help merchants get some of their products. But as we've grown the volume, it's improved relevance and now we're systematically removing friction out of the purchasing experience because we think long term, that's what's great for users. Similarly, we think that users would love to go from that passive experience, which won't go away, but have the option to be able to connect directly with creative people who want to share their passion and expertise. And we've been experimenting with new ways to deepen that experience. From uploading your version of an Idea Pin to a beta that we ran, where you can take a live class or directly engage with the creators. So laying that kind of foundational subscription system is really what we're building out right now. And we think that as that gets built out, it opens up great possibilities for our users to fulfill our mission, and it opens up great possibilities for businesses who want to connect with Pinners in different ways.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I guess, first, a follow-up on users. With U.S. MAUs reverting back essentially to pre-pandemic or March last year levels, I guess what gives you confidence or conviction that we won't see more of a decline in some of the international markets as they reopen for travel and recreation?  And then secondly, with respect to the on-platform test transactions that you'll be doing in Q4, curious what that will look like compared to some of the other formats we see in other platforms. Are these buy buttons and rich media ads that take you to a Pinterest checkout page? Or will this have more marketplace functionality through category searches or product listings? If you could add a little more color there, it would be helpful.\nTodd Morgenfeld: I can start -- thank you for the questions, Colin. So I'll start with the user question about what we're seeing in the U.S. and how that might cascade internationally or a perspective on that. And then maybe Ben can talk a little bit about the user experience around shopping that we're envisioning and the vision to that. So I want to be clear about where we are in the quarter and the factors that I'm looking at that influence the outlook for users in the short term, number one. And number two, I wanted to reiterate that what I'm feeling in the moment and what I believe is that we're dealing with pandemic-related issues. Of course, there are other things that we monitor. This is a competitive market for user attention and there are other consumer applications out there. And we mentioned that there was a Google SEO change. Those are small relative to the -- what we believe was almost entirely a pandemic unwind in the quarter that impacted our user engagement. I don't know how that will unfold even in the U.S. over the course of the next few months. And I don't know how it will unfold internationally because this could go in a variety of directions.  So what I am confident in, though, is that this is a service that could appeal to people, a wider array of people than we had on the service prepandemic, if we continue to execute on the strategic initiatives that we've outlined. I'm highly confident that the work we're doing on our creator and content ecosystem will deepen engagement. Ben talked about the success we've had in growing our Gen Z audience as an example. They're engaging more than most on the Idea Pins and this is a natural format for sustained growth in that area. So that gives me confidence we're investing in the right things to be accretive to engagement and revenue over time. I don't know, however, how it will unfold over the next couple of months. So that's why we gave the update that we gave with an intra-quarter update and made it clear that we're just -- we're evaluating the pandemic in real time.  So Ben, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about the experience, the transactions experience.\nBenjamin Silbermann: I think that I'd probably just say that we want to significantly reduce the friction for the user. And so we're probably not going to talk about the specific solution yet, but you'll see it soon enough, you'll see it this year. And then if you put it together into the broader shopping vision, I think it begins to paint a really compelling story.  Today, we want to help you go from an inspiring image that you might see. You can identify products in there. You can browse related products, filter by price, and we want to add to that, then built to check out with just 1 click. But as I mentioned at the beginning, I think over the long term, there's also a way to connect that vision to a vision where creators are actively sharing their expertise and passion. And you saw this week, the launch of 1 small step in that direction, which is the ability for creators to tag products in their shops or in their videos. And in early tests, we find that Pinners are significantly upwards of 90% more likely to engage on products tag and Idea Pins than on just a picture of a product on a white background. So we see these things working in tandem over time. And we're really excited because that's core to our mission of giving people inspiration, but not stopping there, helping them go all the way to a life they'll love, which often involves purchasing a product.\nJane Penner: I think that's our final question, operator, and welcome back Ben to close the call.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Well, I just want to thank everyone today for participating and for the thoughtful questions. Enjoy the rest of the day, and please do stay safe and healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Pinterest second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in Q2 and provide a preliminary outlook for Q3. As noted in our shareholder letter, fewer monthly active users came to Pinterest in Q2 than we expected. Ben's remarks on the letter detail why we think this happened. But in summary, we believe that nearly all of what we're seeing now is the unwinding of some of the engagement benefits that we got during an unprecedented period of time when people were stuck at home and had more time to spend on some of our core use cases.  We also continue to monitor other factors, including competition and the impact of Google's recent search algorithm changes while continuing to improve our product and ramp up our marketing efforts to increase engagement over time. We're encouraged that our most engaged monthly active users, those that use our mobile applications, grew year-over-year, both in the U.S. and globally. These users contributed a significant majority of both total impressions and total revenue in Q2. Additionally, the investments we've been making to more efficiently realize value from the unique existing engagement we have is working well. Specifically, the engagement we have on shopping services appears to be more resilient than overall engagement. We plan to continue investing in helping Pinners shop for products they love at a price point they want and in helping merchants get discovered and connected to people who will love their products and services.  While we're still early in the journey to fully monetize our shopping engagement, we believe that we have the right sales coverage model, and we're delivering conversions to advertisers who are seeking sales on the platform.  Looking beyond the COVID-19-driven volatility, our view on the long-term opportunity to grow our user base, both in the U.S. and globally, is unchanged from what it was before the pandemic.  Turning to our financial performance. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 125%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%. This remarkable growth was propelled by 2 main drivers. First, we saw momentum from large advertisers, especially retailers, who returned to the platform in force as consumers resumed social activity when pandemic restrictions leaves. Other going out subverticals like beauty and travel also returned to strength in Q2. Second, our international business again performed really well, growing 227% year-over-year in Q2 and contributing 22% of total revenue. Both of these trends show the growth and diversification of our active advertiser base, which grew both sequentially and year-over-year.  Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q3. The engagement headwinds we observed in Q2 have continued in July. As of Tuesday, U.S. monthly active users have declined approximately 7% and global monthly active users have grown approximately 5% year-over-year. The evolution of COVID-19 and pandemic restrictions remain unknown, and we're not providing guidance on Q3 2021 monthly active users, given our lack of visibility into certain key drivers of engagement, which could continue to play out for a few quarters. On the revenue side, we expect total revenue to grow in the low 40s on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q3 revenue guide takes into account a few things: first, Ben talked about the important transition we're making from being a place where people view static images safe from the web to the place where people go to discover the best native immersive lifestyle content. That's a big behavior change for us. To build a new ecosystem for creators, we have to invest, and that means giving distribution to Idea Pins at the expense of some high-value advertising inventory, which impacts revenue. We believe that in the long term, this strategy will be engagement accretive and that we'll have a significant opportunity to monetize that engagement. [Technical Difficulty] through the course of the year and in Q3.  There was a big rebound in ad spend during the quarter as large CPG and retail advertisers reengaged after the initial shock of COVID, and we believe we benefited from being a positive platform during the social media boycott amidst the 2020 election cycle.  Finally, we're carefully monitoring the impact of increasing prices on the platform. These increases are consistent with our strategy to grow our advertiser base, increase auction density and deliver ads more efficiently over time, but that may increase the churn for some price-sensitive advertisers whose cost per action has increased.  Before opening it up for questions, I also want to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our key strategic priorities of inspiring content, the Pinner experience, advertiser success and shopping. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 51% year-over-year, driven in part by our brand marketing campaign. We increased our head count 21% year-over-year, our third quarter of sequential acceleration. We expect sequential non-GAAP operating expenses to grow modestly in Q3 as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term strategic initiatives and growth drivers and resume our brand marketing campaign again in early Q4.  Thank you to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. No, I think that's great, Ben. Ross, why don't I take the second part of your question, which I tried to talk about a little bit in my prepared remarks, but I'll pause and double-click on it a little bit. I think you are interested in the impact of our creator and content ecosystem and particularly the distribution of Idea Pins. There were really 3 reasons that were -- 3 factors that are kind of influencing that low 40s guide. From a quantification perspective, it's difficult to pin down exact numbers, but 3 things are in my head when informing that guide. The first is we are building out a content and creator ecosystem with our Idea Pin format. That will require some investments to get up and running.  There are things around that, around pivoting people from the grid format to streaming experiences, consuming some of our highest value ad slot inventory to distribute those Idea Pins. And the cold start issue because we don't have enough content yet, relevance is a bit of a challenge until we get this marketplace, this content marketplace in effect. So it is an investment in the long-term engagement and growth potential of the company to use some of that supply to distribute Idea Pins. We believe that, that will be accretive to engagement longer term, and we know and have talked about in the past that we've already seen some evidence we can monetize that format. I'm confident that given the short-form video nature of that content and our enormous success in scaling video advertising over time that we'll find similar success with these creator efforts. I might remind folks that we went through a similar exercise with shopping over the last couple years where we made an investment in the user experience first to find product market fit before we put our foot on the gas around monetizing.  And I view this similarly: we're investing in the user experience to get this content marketplace up and running with Idea Pins on the belief that with the right product market fit, we'll drive organic engagement and be able to follow with monetizable [Technical Difficulty] self-explanatory and we went through it in detail on the call, the Q3 call from last year. But the impact of high returning automation through the course of 2020, the big rebound in CPG in retail and the benefits to us of not being a social media platform during the social media boycotts during a contentious election cycle last year makes for a pretty tough comp in Q3.  And then as I mentioned, we're out looking at the things that are on strategy for us, which is diversifying our advertiser base, delivering more auction pressure, driving more cost per action on the platform, and that may cause some rotation amongst our most price-sensitive advertisers. But advertisers value the commercial intent we bring, they value our demographic and they value our brand safety narrative. And for those advertisers, we're continuing to see tremendous success. But we're in an escalating pricing environment that may squeeze out those that are -- that value some of those characteristics less. And so those are the things that are on my mind as we guide to the low 40s for the quarter. Does that make sense? Yes. So on the user base question, Brian, our mobile app users contribute a significant majority of our total impressions, they're higher frequency and therefore, they deliver a significant majority of our revenue. If you look globally, and there are a lot of ways to cut this. But one way we think about it is globally about 75% of our users are mobile users. And a large majority of those users are mobile app users, so that dimensionalizes it to some extent. Now these web users that come in not on the mobile app are important to us because they're upper funnel user acquisition, right? They're not heavy consumers of impressions or big delivery of near-term revenue, but they do inform growth potential over time. So they're important to us, just not as important to the near-term revenue performance of the company.  Folks may remember a couple of years ago in, I think it was the second quarter of 2018, we had some external factors that impacted user growth, but continue to grow our revenue right through those engagement issues, and it's a similar dynamic that we saw last quarter. And apologies. Can I -- can you please repeat your second question? Yes. So on the native checkout side, I think we said last quarter that we were planning to begin testing at some point this year in less friction filled or friction-free way for our users to buy what they found on Pinterest, which is one of our big request from our users. How do I buy what that sounds on Pinterest? And we've enabled that over time, but we're making it even easier for people to do that as a result of some of these tests that are on track for later this year.  Our investments in Latin America are early. We've got a great team in place. The early returns are scaling nicely. We're building great relationships. It's working, but it's still incredibly early. We just launched a couple of months ago in Brazil and Mexico. And while I'm really encouraged by the user base that we have down there and the market opportunity, it's still very early, and that will continue to scale over time.  And then lastly, we're investing in growing our user base in some markets in Asia Pacific that we think we could open up over time, but that's not on the road map for this year yet. Sure. Why don't I take the first and third, and Ben may take the second. [Technical Difficulty] I think users rather than DAUs. And we are -- as you mentioned, we're down through Tuesday, about 7% on a year-over-year basis, those are preliminary numbers. I think we're just trying to get some direction post the end of the quarter to show some updated trends. Yes, if it were to hold. I think that's right. If it were to hold through the quarter. What I would want to caution folks -- so yes, that math is correct. But it implies that we stay current at these levels, which is something I didn't want to lead people to believe on this call because I don't have enough visibility into how these pandemic restrictions easing or any other pandemic-related changes in user behavior may play out because it's been very difficult to discern.  We look at -- just for color commentary on this, we look at pretty detailed time series analysis. We've looked at historical seasonality, and we've done using third-party analysis based on time spent at home to correlate usage against what we see as mobility data in geographies where we have users. And so our best judgment right now, just given the volatility is to give the update on where we are in July, because our experience in forecasting recently has been a little off of where it was historically, if that makes sense. So yes, there's a lot of words to say, yes, your math is correct, but I would caution people that we're not guiding to this Q3 end results at this point, given the uncertainty around the pandemic. Does that make sense? Okay. And then on the advertiser side, we've made -- part of the value of being on Pinterest, and we hear this from advertisers a lot, they love the brand safety and the inspiration that the platform brings. They love the early commercial intent that our user base brings to the platform because you're looking for ideas to bring into your life. And a lot of the activity is unbranded when people come. They're looking -- they don't yet know what they want, but they're effectively shopping. They're looking for new ideas, considering those ideas and eventually purchasing them.  So the value of being out in front, and we've demonstrated this with our delivery of insights over the last couple of years tied to seasonal moments where we can see consumer behavior before it unfolds and help our advertisers design campaigns against those seasonal moments. That speaks to the value of an earlier touch. And the industry has been conditioned on last click analysis for a long time. So a lot of our marketing and sales work is designed to prove that earlier touch is where you want to be when you're diversifying your spend for consumer Internet advertising.  Tools like our Pinterest conversion analysis, conversion insights, which looks at the GMV delivered by organic and promoted shopping behavior and then our Pinterest conversion lift tool. These are all innovations that we've delivered over the last several quarters, couple of years to better demonstrate the value of longer attribution windows and that earlier touch. And so those are the things that we've delivered. But this is part of our go-to-market and our marketing program in general is demonstrating the value of inspiration on the platform, demonstrating the value of insights that we can uniquely glean from our consumer behavior and help show increasingly the value of that earlier touch for those that are willing to consider that as a factor in their spend. Does that make sense? Okay. And then I don't know, Ben, if you had thoughts on the Idea Pins question. So on the shopping question, I'll go into a couple of things. Number one, we've continued to invest in the product experience. And so that's shown where our ability to deliver more inventory has continued to increase. We've delivered 50% more sequentially in terms of product inventory through catalog uploads in Q2 versus Q1. We've rolled out shopping features to Australia, Canada, France and Germany. We launched shopping list which is a way for Pinners to save product pins in 1 place for easy shopping and enable notifications when price drops on, say, product pins. And these are all in service of creating a better shopping experience that we talked about. Those through early tests show that our Pinners are 7x more likely to buy products they've saved.  As we talked about earlier, we're also launching the -- we're testing a plan to test that on platform transaction experience later this year. But to the most direct way of talking about it and the thing that we had, like, pointed to in terms of shopping behavior was our weekly shoppers in the U.S. was more performant than our overall monthly active users. They're about flat year-over-year versus down a few points. Does that answer your questions? So Mark, I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Ben comment a little bit on some of the user behavior that we've seen. I don't have an update through Tuesday on the mobile app MAUs, but what we saw last quarter was they were modestly positive year-over-year in the U.S. and grew about roughly 20% globally. And so that gives you some sense, but I didn't update them through Tuesday and don't have them to share on this call. And then, Justin, I think the second part of your question was about the impact of the 50% sequential increase in catalogs on the platform. I think around a little bit to say, you may remember this little echo of some of the conversations we've had over the last few quarters, but I'll remind folks that similar to how I kicked off the call, we're majoring in the user experience and product market fit with respect to shopping. So our investments in catalog ingestion were designed to improve the inventory of shoppable content we have available to us to deliver and then marry that with better access to natural high-intent discovery services for our users to find that content in a natural journey from inspiration to purchase.  The catalog ingestion success that we've had really improved the first of those, the inventory available to us to deliver products to users that match their aesthetic from a retailer that they trust at an appropriate price point. And so we have seen nice growth in our shopping revenue, consistent with that product market fit that's still developing and improving as advertisers see the value of promoting the shopping content that our users are increasingly engaging in. So that is, hopefully, that's a little bit better, helpful color on how I think about the catalog piece. Our availability of shopping content means that we have a bunch of potential content to promote for advertisers who are seeing that GMV success on the platform. Yes, I can kick off with the guidance piece, and then maybe Ben can talk about these or the second part of your question. The way I think about it is we do have highly engaged mobile app users where we drive the bulk of our revenue. But for those users as we pivot and introduce the creator ecosystem and more Idea Pins, there are a couple of things we're doing even with those users, right? We're pivoting them from a grid format to a streaming format that consumes some of the time they would have spent on the platform.  We're using some of our highest value add slots for those users, and we're replacing them with Idea Pins. So the distribution is coming in place of known economic return [Technical Difficulty] find that it's a compelling way to go from idea to action.  We're also evaluating this relevance question. We've talked a lot about how diversifying our advertiser base is important because we want to increasingly deliver ads that feel like content to users. In this particular area with Idea Pins without an abundance of content, relevance is challenging to get up and running. And so that has some implications for engagement as people have a less than satisfying experience on site. So these are all things that we know we will deal with as we get this marketplace, this content marketplace up and running. But I wanted to be clear about how I was thinking about it. It's an investment in monetizable supply to get that content marketplace up and running and successful, that we think is the right long-term investment for the company.  It's unclear how the adoption rates will go. Some of it's within our control to some extent, too, how it unfolds. But I wanted to give you my best judgment of where we're headed based on my current assessment of road map, what we're seeing in the quarter and where we're heading. Does that make sense? Okay. And then on the user experience, I don't know, Ben, if you wanted to add any color? I can start -- thank you for the questions, Colin. So I'll start with the user question about what we're seeing in the U.S. and how that might cascade internationally or a perspective on that. And then maybe Ben can talk a little bit about the user experience around shopping that we're envisioning and the vision to that. So I want to be clear about where we are in the quarter and the factors that I'm looking at that influence the outlook for users in the short term, number one. And number two, I wanted to reiterate that what I'm feeling in the moment and what I believe is that we're dealing with pandemic-related issues. Of course, there are other things that we monitor. This is a competitive market for user attention and there are other consumer applications out there. And we mentioned that there was a Google SEO change. Those are small relative to the -- what we believe was almost entirely a pandemic unwind in the quarter that impacted our user engagement. I don't know how that will unfold even in the U.S. over the course of the next few months. And I don't know how it will unfold internationally because this could go in a variety of directions.  So what I am confident in, though, is that this is a service that could appeal to people, a wider array of people than we had on the service prepandemic, if we continue to execute on the strategic initiatives that we've outlined. I'm highly confident that the work we're doing on our creator and content ecosystem will deepen engagement. Ben talked about the success we've had in growing our Gen Z audience as an example. They're engaging more than most on the Idea Pins and this is a natural format for sustained growth in that area. So that gives me confidence we're investing in the right things to be accretive to engagement and revenue over time. I don't know, however, how it will unfold over the next couple of months. So that's why we gave the update that we gave with an intra-quarter update and made it clear that we're just -- we're evaluating the pandemic in real time.  So Ben, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about the experience, the transactions experience."

            "name": "Benjamin Silbermann",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane. Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. I'm going to talk for a few minutes, and then Todd will follow up with some additional insight, and then we'll open up for questions. Earlier today, we released our latest shareholder letter. As you've seen, we grew revenue faster than expected. And at the same time, we saw a decrease in engagement as stay-at-home orders eased around the world. I want to discuss each in turn.  Starting with revenue. Revenue increased 125% year-over-year to $613 million. We saw more and more advertisers here in the U.S. and increasingly across the globe recognize the value we offer in connecting them with people planning for their lives. It's a clear signal that our investments in shopping, automation and tools are working. And we plan to continue investing to make it easier for advertisers to scale and reach new customers on Pinterest.  On the user growth front, we grew globally monthly active users 9% year-over-year. And I'm sure there are questions about this, so I thought I'd take a few of the obvious ones head on.  The first question is what happened with user behavior? As we all know, the pandemic was an unprecedented and unique global event. In past earnings calls, we talked about how stay-at-home orders significantly increased usage of Pinterest. And for the past year, we've highlighted how people came to Pinterest for inspiration to reinvent their lives during such a difficult time.  Now as the world opens up, we're seeing the similar effect in the opposite direction. That impacted our growth, particularly because some of the core use cases we see on our platform are less common in 2021 than they were a year ago. That shift in behavior in Q2 impacted engagements.  Which brings me to the second question, what users did this impact the most? Well, most of the difference between what we guided and what we reported are people who came to Pinterest from the web versus from mobile apps. These users tended to be, on average, less engaged and generated less revenue than people who came directly to Pinterest.  In contrast, in Q2, monthly active users on our mobile apps grew in the U.S. year-over-year and internationally by more than 20%. We're continuing to closely monitor Pinner engagement. So later, Todd will talk you through more about what we've learned a few weeks into our current quarter.  While we navigate the current volatility caused by COVID, we remain focused on building for the long term. Pinterest is at the beginning of a fundamental transition, going from a place [Technical Difficulty] lifestyle expertise in the form of rich interactive videos. We're doing this in a number of ways. First, Idea Pins are our first publishing tool, enabling creators to share ideas with lasting value. Second, the creator code is our initiative to make sure Pinterest remains a positive and supportive environment. And third, we'll be adding new features to help creators foster community. We intend to go beyond likes and comments, and we'll build tools that let people share their creations, ask and answer questions and offer encouragement and share tips. We're still early in this transition, but those early results are positive.  The number of Idea Pins created daily has grown more than sevenfold since the beginning of the year. More and more, creators are publishing ideas and opening up new worlds on Pinterest on everything from outfit ideas, school activities, workout routines and vacation ideas. And Idea Pins are resonating with our fastest-growing audience, Gen Z. This audience grew double digits year-over-year. We plan to continue to execute on this strategy with more product launches like product tagging, which came out this week to help reward creators for their work and get Pinners another way to go from inspiration to purchase till later this year, when we make it possible for all Pinners to create Idea Pins as well as many more capabilities. For us, these aren't just a series of one-off moves; rather they add up to a larger vision on how we intend to pursue our mission. It has to do something we believe Pinterest is uniquely positioned to do: to tie together the lifestyle inspiration you've seen on TV with the positivity and enjoyment that comes with being part of a community of shared interests with the utility that comes from great planning and shopping tools. Creators are an important building block fulfilling our mission of giving everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Todd for his thoughts. Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. I can start with your first one, which was a little bit more color on the changes in user behavior that we're seeing. And as Todd outlined, there are a few things that are changing as the pandemic is eased. One, overall time at home has shifted. And two, a lot of the use cases that were especially relevant last year, things like redecorating your home, educating your kid at home, cooking meals at home, those have lessened. Now it's early to say how those will normalize over time. I wouldn't describe the current user behavior or the current social environment exactly the same, but we're seeing some promising early signs. We're looking at things like back-to-school, we're seeing an uptick in fashion. And as mentioned, we continue to see strength in areas like Gen Z, which engage and continue to be our fastest-growing demographic. I don't know if that starts to answer your question. Todd, I'm not sure if you want to add any more color there. Sure, Rich. So I think your question was kind of like how many people are seeing these Idea Pins? Where are we in that journey? And I think it's probably worth just taking a moment to visit like why we're going through, why we're describing it as a big transition.  Today, the much of Pinterest content is based on users' pinning items for the web, and it's creating enormous value for businesses, enormous value for people looking for ideas. And over the last few years, we've told you about increasing importance of video content, which has grown significantly. And Idea Pins are the next logical step because they not only enable people to save a video, but they enable creators to produce original content that's aligned with our unique brand and purpose, which is inspiring useful ideas that encourage people to try something new.  But as Todd mentioned, that's a new user behavior. And so the reason we say it's early is because we're going to get our Pinner community used to the idea of following and subscribing creators. And on the flip side, we're going to empower creators with not only publishing tools, ways to engage that audience and eventually to make a living. We think there's an enormous opportunity there because while there's a lot of long-form video and there's a ton in short-form entertainment video, there isn't as much in the type of things that Pinterest specializes in, which are inspiring ideas, ideas that have durable value and ultimately, ideas that can drive action. So we're really excited about that. And the early results are really promising.  So in Q2, we launched Idea Pin, that is the ability to publish them in 22 markets to those with a business account. We have not yet released it to everybody on Pinterest. So if you don't have a business account, you can't yet create Idea Pins, but that will be coming. But already, Idea Pin's created daily. It's grown more than 7x. And on the user side, we're seeing really good adoption with daily impressions growing more than 10x since January. So this is going to be a big shift for the company.  As Todd mentioned, we're really leaning into it, investing. Investing in helping these traders build a community. But over the long term, we think they can change Pinterest from a passive experience where you're browsing imagery to one where you're following people. And we also think that it can bolster all of our other initiatives around not only giving people inspiration, but helping them take action by letting them purchase the things that they've seen. Sure. I mean I think that the first step, Rich, is we're really going to make it much more broadly available. And we're going to make it so people encounter creators and Idea Pins a lot more often. And that's really the first phase, and we're focused on helping these creators build a community. And that's the first phase. And then we're going to build out from there. So that's how we're approaching it internally. Sure. I'll start, Mark, with this question of who the creators are. I mean I think it starts with like what's our mission and our unique place as a platform. Pinterest has always been a place that provides lifestyle inspiration, things where people aren't there just to get in their team. They're also there to do something. And we're focused on short form. And so that means there are a lot of creators that exist on the platform but there are also creators where other platforms that are focused more on pure entertainment aren't serving their needs as directly. And so we've seen a lot of really interesting early kind of creator success, things that are core to our use cases but are expressed in a much more engaging way. Make him breakfasts, work outs, cleanup products for a glow up.  And just to put a point on it, one example is a fashion photographer who's been in the early beta. His name is Shane. He's cultivated an audience of 18,000, average 9 million monthly views in only a few months. And what he does is he uses these Idea Pins to take Pinners kind of behind the scenes at fashion shoots and share tips how to succeed as a young entrepreneurial photographer, creative ideas. And what he says is that Pinterest is allowing him to connect with his audience or his community on a deeper level that's harder for him to reach on other platforms. Part of that is because of its search engine-like nature. People are actively looking to churn. Internally, we call that kind of intent. And then the feedback that he's received, he describes as really breathtaking. And so he's excited about cultivating the audience that's more intentful versus browsing, more inspiring or entertaining person after another.  So that's kind of the character. We think there are a lot that are on the platform that haven't had the publishing tools. We're focused on that. We think there are a lot of outside the platform, and we're eager to bring them on and give them the best tools to inspire their community and eventually make a living from it. Mark, the second question was what have we observed about folks that joined during COVID, what's the same and what's different. So the things that are the same are we continue to see that these core lifestyle verticals, fashion, food, beauty, health, they continue to be really important. And while coming from last year to this year, the overall usage is lower. We think those are durable things. Those are things that people care about and they're going to continue to care about. And so in terms of progress, we continue to invest to make sure those experiences, including making all those experiences more shoppable, continue to be really great.  One interesting thing that we have noticed is that we continue to see Gen Z grow on Pinterest. So the U.S. monthly attributes [Technical Difficulty] women's fashion. But it's a really exciting early trend. And it's one that we're really excited to cater to because it's obviously a future demographic that will grow into an incredibly valuable cohort in the future. Sure, Justin. So I think at a high level, you're asking where do we think that future growth is going to come from. And we've covered a little bit new demographics that are going. But maybe one way to interpret it is what are the functionalities? How is the platform improving to be more useful to more people at the time? I think that we covered at some length on why we think the creators, while a long-term initiative is pretty fundamental. If you think about large-scale consumer Internet platforms, you have social platforms, and then you have a long list of ones that have some form of publish and subscribe, when you can follow people to create content. And usually, that's video content. Pinterest is somewhat unique in that it's grown as a utility where you browse and look at content. And so we're introducing something that we think that our users are really looking for, our users tell us that they want a place where they can browse video content, they can follow inspiring people who really major in expertise and lifestyle and minor in celebrity and entertainment rather than the other way around. And so we're really excited about that long-term prospect.  On the flip side of that, you have utility, like how useful is Pinterest at helping you go from inspiration to actually a purchase. And there, we've made tremendous progress. A year or 2 ago, one of the most common user concerns was that I would see an image, I would want to purchase it, but I couldn't reliably get there. But a lot of investments we've made from increasing the amount of products uploaded through catalogs, to better ways to pivot from an image or a video to products and interrelated products and then to a brand page, to future things like the shopping list that we leased, test to needed checkout, make Pinterest itself more and more useful for taking us on a full journey from inspiration all the way to purchase.  So I think both of these things are long-term tailwinds. I also do believe we're still early days in terms of international growth and expansion. And so we're going to continue to invest there. And I think there's a lot of great future growth to be had. Well, I think we've covered it. I think the important thing to understand is that we are introducing a new user experience. And we had a large-scale service, it takes some getting used to. But there are a few things that I think are really encouraging and really will cater to the unique nature of the platform. One is where we've seen a lot of Idea Pins be successful early are items that have utility. And so as people add more content, that begins to fill up a content corpus that has long-lasting value. So it's not a highlight of today's party, it might be a recipe you can cook, an outfit that you can try on, a new way to style something, a new workout. And so over time, as more and more of these Idea Pins are generated, we have a larger and larger body of pins to recommend. That increases relevance. And it helps people find those 1 or 2 creators that really connect with their interests.  The other thing I would say is that historically, we have and we continue to be focused on the long term. We took a really long bet, as Todd mentioned, on shopping. And we had a very similar dynamic where we had to help merchants get some of their products. But as we've grown the volume, it's improved relevance and now we're systematically removing friction out of the purchasing experience because we think long term, that's what's great for users. Similarly, we think that users would love to go from that passive experience, which won't go away, but have the option to be able to connect directly with creative people who want to share their passion and expertise. And we've been experimenting with new ways to deepen that experience. From uploading your version of an Idea Pin to a beta that we ran, where you can take a live class or directly engage with the creators. So laying that kind of foundational subscription system is really what we're building out right now. And we think that as that gets built out, it opens up great possibilities for our users to fulfill our mission, and it opens up great possibilities for businesses who want to connect with Pinners in different ways. I think that I'd probably just say that we want to significantly reduce the friction for the user. And so we're probably not going to talk about the specific solution yet, but you'll see it soon enough, you'll see it this year. And then if you put it together into the broader shopping vision, I think it begins to paint a really compelling story.  Today, we want to help you go from an inspiring image that you might see. You can identify products in there. You can browse related products, filter by price, and we want to add to that, then built to check out with just 1 click. But as I mentioned at the beginning, I think over the long term, there's also a way to connect that vision to a vision where creators are actively sharing their expertise and passion. And you saw this week, the launch of 1 small step in that direction, which is the ability for creators to tag products in their shops or in their videos. And in early tests, we find that Pinners are significantly upwards of 90% more likely to engage on products tag and Idea Pins than on just a picture of a product on a white background. So we see these things working in tandem over time. And we're really excited because that's core to our mission of giving people inspiration, but not stopping there, helping them go all the way to a life they'll love, which often involves purchasing a product. Well, I just want to thank everyone today for participating and for the thoughtful questions. Enjoy the rest of the day, and please do stay safe and healthy."

And now, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Hello, everyone. Thanks, Jane, and thanks everyone for joining today. I just want to start by acknowledging that last March was the start of the pandemic and we are not still fully through it. Leading through this difficult time has been a humbling experience and I am deeply proud of everyone at Pinterest for their commitment to our teams, to our partners and to our Pinners. I am also proud that during the challenging time, we've shared inspiration with hundreds of millions of people around the world and help businesses reach customers when their physical storefronts may have been closed. Like all of you, I look forward to seeing the pandemic end and look forward to a time when we can be together once again. Now today, Todd is going to go into specifics regarding our financial results, and I'll talk about how we are thinking about Pinterest as we begin to come out of the pandemic. But I want to start by saying that this is a strong quarter. We are confident in our strategy and excited about the investments we are making. Let me offer some more details. First, more people are using Pinterest to inspire and plan their lives than ever before. Our monthly active users grew 30% to more than 478 million users globally with strong growth coming from Gen Z, a persistent trend that we've seen for several quarters. We also saw product searches grow more than 20x year-over-year. Increasingly, people see Pinterest as a place to not only get inspired, but also to shop. Second, our business is strong. Advertisers are inspiring Pinners and they are generating sales on Pinterest. We grew revenue 78% year-over-year, driven by more small-to-mid-sized advertisers and further international expansion. Businesses appreciate that Pinterest is a positive place where people are coming to get new ideas for their lives. Well targeted ads make Pinterest more useful rather than being a distraction for what people are there to do. And these businesses are seeing strong business results, driven significantly by the investments we made to make our advertising products more effective and easier to use. Third, we are working to help people feel more inspired in every aspect of their life, and that starts with giving people the most inspiring content. We continue to invest in new inspiring forms of content like Story Pins. Story Pins on Pinterest are different from stories and other platforms. They are less about what somebody else did and more about what you could do now and in the future. Unlike stories and other platforms, they never disappear and they don't just show up for followers. They show up for anybody looking for an idea like yours, like what you need to do to get your home decorated that dinner made without workout done. In Q1, we started distributing Story Pins more broadly throughout our creator ecosystem, and we are excited by the uptake we are already seeing. As we continue to distribute Story Pins, Pinners will need to learn new ways to navigate and use Pinterest. This could change engagement in the coming quarters, but we are confident that over time investing in new media formats like Story Pins will inspire our community, provide new ways to engage with Pinterest more deeply and create new revenue opportunities for creators and businesses alike. We are also making it easier for Pinners to take out as they see and make them real. The number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces of Pinterest has grown over 200% in the last year as Pinners look to go from inspiration to purchase. At the end of Q1, revenue from retailers with sales objectives were 20% of total revenue, and all of this shows that we are making a real traction with shopping on Pinterest. And to next step, we are excited to begin testing seamless on-platform transactions later this year. And finally, we continue to expand our business globally. We launched advertising in Brazil this quarter, an important milestone in growing our global ads business. We expanded our Shopify integration to 27 additional countries to help us further build Pinterest as a destination for shopping. And for the first time, our international business is nearly 20% of total revenue. We are seeing a lot of strengths in our business, but it's important to note that since the pandemic began, we've seen a correlation between stay-at-home orders and engagement on Pinterest. Pinterest has always been popular for home improvement, recipe collection and lesson planning, and naturally many of us did more of these things during our time at home, which brought more people to Pinterest in 2020. As pandemic lockdowns were eased in some parts of the world during mid-March, we began to see signs of less engagement and user growth on Pinterest, and we assume this means people are spending more time offline. While it's impossible to say how people act as we enter the summer months, we anticipate this trend will continue. Finally, I'd like to note that like the entire online advertising industry, we\u2019re faced with changes to the privacy landscape. We've talked for over a year about the steps we are taking to ensure advertisers understand the effectiveness of their ads, while also keeping Pinner privacy in mind. This includes investments in new first-party solutions enhancements to ad targeting. People naturally come to Pinterest to search, shop and find ideas for brands and creators. Personalization based on its onset activity won't be affected by the upcoming changes. That said, it\u2019s still early days, it is not yet clear what the long-term impact will be. To close, I'd like to note that this past year has reinforced the importance of our mission. Pinterest is not the place to read the news or debate politics with your cousin or compare yourself to other people. It is a positive place to be inspired and get ideas in your future life. This is reflected in our content and ad policies, our efforts to combat COVID vaccine misinformation, our new creator code and comment moderation tools designed to keep new content formats positive and inspiring and our continued focus in engineering products for positivity with new inclusive search features like skin tone ranges now available in 13 countries. I am excited about how far we've come over a challenging year and even more excited about where we go in the future. I'll now pass it on to Todd.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in the first quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for Q2. Let's start with a quick summary of the headlines, and then we'll go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we had a really strong first quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 78%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 17%. Monthly active user growth remains strong with all regions, once again showing good momentum. First quarter revenue growth was propelled by two main drivers. First, we saw strong momentum from mid-market and managed small advertisers who are increasingly finding value in our conversion-focused ad products and the automation of our ad stack  Second, our international business performed really well, growing 170% year-over-year in the first quarter. We are seeing the highest growth in Western Europe and Canada, where we are continuing to expand our sales coverage. Both of these trends show in the growth and diversification of our advertiser base. The drivers of our growth in the first quarter, including performance ads products for small and medium-sized businesses, automation and advertiser diversification, probably sound familiar because we've been talking about our investment in them since our IPO a couple of years ago. As we begin to dig into newer strategic initiatives, such as building a native content ecosystem, I think it's worth taking a minute to draw your attention to our playbook for these kinds of investments. In general, our philosophy is to deliver value to Pinners first, then lean into scale and monetize. This worked well for the international rollout of our ads business, as well as for our shopping initiative. For international, we executed a blueprint for ad sales in the U.S. before scaling it globally. We knew that global users were there to support an expansion, but we got the gears working properly in the U.S. before leaning in. This worked well. We are serving ads in 29 countries today and international revenue comprised almost 20% of total revenue in the first quarter. And we just launched in our first Latin American country, Brazil with Mexico coming in May. For shopping, we prioritize building an organic shopping experience for Pinners with high-quality inventory, catalog uploads and discovery services before really leaning into monetization. This strategy has also been very effective to-date though it's still relatively early days. Not only have we dramatically scaled shopping engagement on the platform, we shared for the first time today, that ad revenue from retailers optimizing for sales on Pinterest is now a meaningful part of our financial performance. In both our international ads rollout and in shopping, we serve the Pinner first by getting the fundamental infrastructure in place and only then scaling and monetizing the experience. We are running the same playbook as we build a native content ecosystem. We are currently focused on delivering value to Pinners by making it easier for creators to make great content and learning the optimal mechanisms to distribute that content. It\u2019s very early in our journey to achieve scale or drive meaningful monetization at this point. We are currently investing R&D and sales and marketing resources to get our content ecosystem off the ground and we are confident that we understand how best to deliver value to Pinners, we will lean in harder to scale and monetize. That may take the form of additional investment, but it's too early to know exactly what that looks like today. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q2. Ben mentioned that we have both headwinds and potential tailwinds for engagement and MAU growth that may play out over the next couple of quarters. In Q2, we expect global monthly active users to grow in the mid-teens and U.S. monthly active users to be about flat on a year-over-year percentage basis. We expect to grow revenue about 105% year-over-year in Q2. As we think about the first quarter and the full-year, we believe the momentum and returns we are seeing from our investments and ad tools and sales coverage expansion should continue. Starting at the end of March, we began to lap easier year-ago revenue comparisons, which will continue through Q2 and is factored into our guidance. Before opening up for questions, I also want to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our big strategic priorities of inspiring content, Pinner experience, advertiser success, and shopping. In the first quarter, we grew our headcount 17% year-over-year. We expect our sequential non-GAAP OpEx growth to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term initiatives and growth drivers. And as a reminder, we are investing in marketing campaigns to bolster comprehension and brand awareness throughout the year. Those campaign launches in Q2 will drive a substantial and sizable increase in our variable spend. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nJane Penner: Operator, we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Todd, just a question about the guidance. So obviously, we've got pretty robust revenue growth here in the second quarter, but you said, the U.S. is going to be flat and that would be down sequential for MAU. So how much wiggle room do you think there is still to increase ad load given the massive revenue growth and the flat user growth? And can you give us any context around \u2013 if we look at last quarter or the last couple of quarters, the trade-off between impression growth and eCPM within the U.S.? Thanks a lot.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ross. So understand the question really about user growth and the connection to revenue. So I'll go through a couple of things, and hopefully this gets to the essence of the question. I would say sequentially, we are unwinding some of the pulled forward user growth that we had last year and some of the engagement from the unprecedented COVID period that we all went through over the last year. It\u2019s kind of an exacerbated version of the typical seasonality that we would see going into the summer, but compounded by unwinding some of the restrictions that we had around COVID. We are also \u2013 it's worth noting, making, as I mentioned, investments in comprehension marketing, and a lot of what Ben talked about around our creators and native content efforts are designed to drive long-term engagement. So I don't want to believe that pun intended too. But it's really worth noting and this is something that I'm glad you asked about. It's worth noting that our investments to more efficiently utilize our unique engagement, that commercial mindset and planning behavior that Pinners bring to Pinterest, it's working. We've made investments in product and in sales coverage. As we talked last time, our vision over the long-term is to how advertisers bring their budget, their goals and their content, and we automate the rest. And while we have a long way to go before we get there, we've made it a lot easier for advertisers to onboard scale and see results, especially in the SMB space. And we did that through especially ROI accountable conversion-led performance ads that generate higher potential effective CPMs over time. We saw that unfold over the course of last year through automated bidding across traffic, conversion optimization and shopping objectives. We are working on a similar automation exercise now called campaign budget optimization, which allows for better delivery across ad groups instead of just within ad groups, so continuing that automation theme. And we will launch automated bidding for awareness objectives over the course of this year, too. So that long-term trend around automation continues. We've accelerated further through partnerships like the one with Shopify, it will be expanded internationally. We've partnered all that investment in products through an improved coverage model. We focused on growing our managed SMB coverage, which has now nearly half of our revenue. And you saw the results we've posted internationally with opening new markets in places like Brazil and Mexico next at nearly 20% of our revenue, that's up significantly as a percentage of our mix. But what I wanted to make sure, we highlight, and I think this is your question, is that we are more efficiently using or utilizing the unique engagement that we have on Pinterest and that strategy is working. So when you boil it down to your question about ad impressions and realized pricing or effective CPMs, our revenue growth was mostly driven by effective CPM gains in the quarter versus impressions, especially in our performance products. And the thing that most stood out to me was that our ad load in the U.S. and globally actually ticked down in the first quarter year-over-year, despite U.S. revenue growing 65% and overall revenue growing 78%. So we are much more efficiently using \u2013 utilizing the ad supply that we have because we've automated \u2013 we\u2019ve built the right products with the right automation and ads are working for advertisers on the platform. Does that get to your question?\nRoss Sandler: Yes. That's super helpful. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I want to ask the first one on sort of users and engagement as the world reopens and sort of post shelter in. Yes, I think there are some use cases on the platform around home design that could benefit from the housing market or party planning that benefit from reopening or maybe even travel or there could be a case that maybe you could retain some of this engagement. I guess, talk to us about why you are or are not seeing that as a way to sort of retain some of these users in that engagement as the world reopens and what do you have to invest into sort of capitalize on that? And then the second one, just on IDFA and some of the platform changes, talk to us about how you think about further emphasizing on-platform transactions for shopping to sort of make the advertisers better mitigate, better manage through the IDFA uncertainty?\nBenjamin Silbermann: Sure. Brian, I can start off. Your first question is really about users and engagement. And what I heard was, it seems like there are a lot of core categories that could be quite resilient on how are we thinking about that post-COVID. So taking a step back, Todd mentioned a couple of times that the way we see it is that during COVID, people spend a lot more time online. They spend a lot more time creating new patterns and behaviors for their stay-at-home life and Pinterest was the beneficiary of that. And as thankfully, we want more people spend time outside their home out there in the world and we expect some of that engagement to go away. That said, I'd observe a few things, one of which that you brought up. First, in a lot of the core categories, particularly the commercially strong categories, things like interior design, fashion, we're still seeing a really good resilience. And we have early data that indicates that engagement in those core commercial categories is going to be stickier than engagement overall. And we think that's a good thing. That's evidenced in the strength and uptick in shopping surfaces, the significant increase in the number of shopping-related searches, as well as what we\u2019ve seen in overall user behavior. Second, as you mentioned, there could be certain tailwinds, but we try to communicate what we've seen rather than what we think in the future. To your point, historically, certain events, whether it\u2019s Halloween, holidays, wedding planning, they were big drivers and engagement on Pinterest. We saw that go away, but the net time online kind of went over that during the pandemic. So there could be tailwinds and we're just not baking them in. And so all of that paints a picture where we do expect, as Todd mentioned, a flattish growth in the U.S., but over the long-term, we think there's a lot to be optimistic about. In addition to the constant efforts that we're undertaking now, we mentioned that we're going to be doing our first brand campaign and generally just improving the quality of the Pinner experience over the long-term. So that's how we're kind of thinking about those pieces coming together. Before going on, does that kind of answer your question?\nBrian Nowak: Yes. That's perfect. Thanks.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Okay. The second question I heard was really about IDFA and what are the thoughts that we have on particularly shopping to help retailers to get a little bit closer to Pinterest when they're near that point of transaction. So as an overview, and this is obviously new territory, but we've been talking about it kind of with the community for more than a year. We put in place efforts to improve first-party measurement solutions, few things like shopping solutions. But more to the point, we've also really increased the amount of engagement that Pinners have on shopping surfaces more directly. This year, for example, we allow Pinterest users to pivot any search into a shopping search and that significantly increased engagement on shopping surfaces. This has been part of our strategy all along. If you rewind a couple of quarters, our strategy was, one, we're going to increase the amount of high-quality inventory with things like our catalog uploader, which we expanded with multi-feed, as well as our partnerships with folks like Shopify. It was, two, to make it easier for Pinners to get to those products and that's exemplified and increased the number of shopping surfaces as well as being able to pivot from search to shopping search. The next step in that journey will be early pilots in testing seamless checkout and removing the friction. I mean, that's been the sequence that we\u2019re pursuing for a while and early results are really good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. You talked about the upcoming potential for I think seamless on-platform transactions. So I guess the question Todd would be, does that \u2013 it maybe too early, but would that open the opportunity for new types of revenue models? And then secondly, just ongoing broad question about closing the ARPU gap between your international markets and the U.S. market. And of course, it's going to be broad and wide for a while, but are there any new learnings you've had about how to get that to more in line with \u2013 maybe what you see at some of the other advertising platforms that are out there? Is it just more sales coverage, more self-serve tools? Are there new methods you've found that can help power that or close that gap somewhat more? Thanks a lot.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Mark. So I heard two questions in there. The first was around new revenue models that could be associated with native checkout, and the second was around how that ARPU trend may look over time and drivers. So on the new revenue model point, I think it's probably worth pausing and going back to what some of the opening comments I had about what we endeavor to do when we make new investments. I was really excited last year when we said \u2013 we know our users come to find inspiration and then create real action out of those inspirational items that they get off of Pinterest. And so we focused on getting the right inventory of shoppable products on the platform and to make those products discoverable for our users. So that was the first way of addressing that desire to buy \u2013 that our users express some desire to buy what they found on Pinterest. Through all the work on catalog uploads and work on the organic product to serve more natural shopping journeys that users go through, we were able to fulfill that request. And so as Ben mentioned, the next step might be later in the year testing native checkout. I would say we're trying to make sure that the user experience works first. And we're not committing at this point to any new revenue models. But over the longer-term that's something we could evaluate. Second, on the ARPU opportunity. I think what I was mentioning before around all of the investments we've made in product and in coverage, bringing with a long-term goal of having advertisers bringing their budget, their goals, and their content, and automating the rest, serving especially the SMB market and diversifying our advertiser base, allowing them to easily onboard scale and see results from their spend. We've had a great track record over the last year of delivering that kind of automation and we've invested in exactly the right sales coverage model in the U.S. and internationally to generate demand against that. That has been the recipe for driving ARPU growth. I think we posted 50% ARPU growth in the U.S. last quarter as a result of all of those investments in product and coverage. We've seen that that model works in international markets too are seeing great traction. And as I mentioned, we're now at nearly 20% of our overall revenue from international markets through a similar playbook. It's a playbook that we built as a first step in some of the English-speaking countries outside of the U.S. and then refined in Western Europe, most notably in France and Germany and are now rolling out. It's very, very early days, but are now rolling out in Latin America. We've talked historically about how Pinners come to our platform with a similar mindset in international markets. And so a lot of the international opportunity is really down to execution, and I think we've got the right team in place to deliver against that over time. I'm super encouraged by the progress we've made and the opportunity ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Thanks. Two pretty related questions. I guess, first on the shopping stuff. It does sound like you're seeing a lot of growth in attributed conversions. So beyond getting better visibility in conversions, curious, do you think your users are starting to engage in Pinterest more throughout the funnel closer to the point of purchase such as you can get more credit for this engagement than you have in the past beyond simply more visibility into conversions? And then the second one, as you look beyond maybe simple ad impressions to growth in kind of commercial actions, you talked about doubling measured conversions. But do you see long-term runway to kind of keep growing high intent actions on the platform beyond simply impressions whether that clicks or checkout? Is there still a ton of runway there to drive monetization without really depending on pure price? Kind of anything you can share there would be great.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Lloyd, I can start with the first part and then maybe Todd can kind of add more to the second one. The question as I understood it was, do we feel that users on the platform are really going through more of the funnel who has seen Pinterest increasingly adds the destination to shop? And the answer to that, in short is yes. So if we rewind a little bit and think about kind of where our strategy was a couple of years ago, we knew there was a lot of commercial intent on the platform. But a major painpoint for Pinners was they weren't able to get to the product and then to make it purchase plan easy way. And so the first thing that we really worked on was increasing the amount of shoppable inventory. And as mentioned before, things like the increase in the number of catalog uploads, it's up 14x in the last 12 trailing months has really improved the quality of the inventory. The next step then was to begin showing users that when they were on a piece of content, they could find high-quality products with up-to-date metadata. And that's been sort of the second leg of the stool. So increasingly, if you use Pinterest, when you see a product, you'll find that there's up-to-date pricing information and stock information, and that's the continuous improvement in quality. Over the last quarter and a half, I would say where we've seen real traction is then beginning to let users pivot from what we might call inspiration mode into shopping mode by engaging in shopping on these surfaces. Some of those surfaces are pivots off things like search. Others are looking underneath a large image pen and then being able to go into a feed of related products connected either by a similar look, a similar brand or a similar price point. We think that engagement with those surfaces is indicative of higher shopping intent. And we noticed really strong purchasing behavior off of those surfaces. So now that those foundational pieces are laid, the next thing we want to test is removing friction from the transaction. And that's something, again that we'll pilot, as Todd mentioned, try to get the experience really good and then begin to roll it out more broadly. So I think the short answer is yes, the longer answer is that's the journey we're on. It's not going to be a flip to switch. But we're hearing from Pinners, we're seeing an engagement in shopping surfaces. We're seeing in the growth an attributable conversion that Pinners are increasingly seeing it as a place where they can not only get inspired, but they can also buy.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And Lloyd, the only thing I would really add to that. I think that's a good summary of the user experience that we are building toward. But as an advertiser, you can imagine that maps, that user journey maps really well to advertising objectives ranging from awareness to consideration to purchase. And one of the things that we hear when we talk to CMOs is the value of Pinterest as a full funnel advertising experience across all of those objectives. But as attributed conversions and purchase activity has increased, that was the reason we called out the stat about 20% of our revenue coming from retailers with conversion objectives because it's an important trend. A lot of our early business was built around awareness and consideration objectives or traffic baseline. But what we've seen recently is that shopping ads or catalog-based ads, coupled with conversion optimization ads with checkout or add-to-cart objectives are now for the retail community are now 20% of our overall revenue. And that seems like a mouthful, but it's designed to show exactly what Ben described. The user experience is more lower funnel, and we're increasingly taking our users from inspiration to action through that purchase journey, and it's showing up in our advertising results.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from BofA. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Ben and one for Todd. Ben, in the U.S. market and more mature European market, how do you think about driving user growth over the next two years? Is it things like shopping that could attract a little bit different audience or categories like travel or autos that you think could really take off? Any signs of that encourage you? And then Todd, could you revisit the expense guidance. I'm assuming it excludes the charitable contribution. Does that include cost of goods sold? Can you just revisit the quarter-over-quarter expense guidance? Thank you.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Thanks for the question, Justin. What I heard was in more mature markets where do we see growth coming from? So we said over the last few quarters that there's a sustained trend, particularly Gen Z users are engaging with Pinterest more and more. I think that's pretty interesting because historically Pinterest has attracted a lot of millennials and folks that are a little bit older. And there was a question mark on whether Gen Z users who have a strong interest in socializing with their friends are also interested in investing time to get creative ideas for themselves and explore their hobbies and interests. And I think that what we've seen as the answer to that is it's resounding, yes, while there are some category overlaps, there are also category differences. We see \u2013 this is a group of users that loves fashion. They love exploring their creativity. They're looking now more and more into things like food. This is a group that's not yet really looking into decorating. And so it kind of reflects the same spirit of what Pinterest is about, but at a different stage of life and we see a lot of growth opportunity there. Past that, we do see two big opportunities to just improve the quality of the experience both utility and how inspirational it is. I spoke a little bit about Story Pins as a new media format, and we're talking about it as new, but it really follows a trend that we've been working on for a while and talking about of moving from just imagery to videos and then to interactive videos. So for the last couple of quarters and we talked there's been an enormous increase in the amount of video consumption. That's reflected in the amount of time people are spending in watching videos, it's reflected in a disproportionate contribution to ad revenue. I mean, we think that Story Pins are the next step in that evolution. So letting people have a closed loop where they can publish directly onto the platform, they can engage users, not about entertainment, but about their interests. And those users can contribute back and can build more of a community around that media. We think that's something that's different. It's not really a new that's met in the market in the same way that Pinterest is approaching it. And so while we don't forecast that into growth because it's early days, we think long-term, it's something that's going to really improve the growth and the engagement on the platform.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And Justin on the expense side, I'll break that down a little bit. I think there was a question in there about the charitable contribution and how that would be treated, and then how we're thinking about OpEx versus cost of revenue. As a reminder, cost of revenue scales with our user growth and product complexity, so that's more tied to our user growth forecast and tends to be disconnected from revenue performance. It's much more seasonal than our user growth. What I was referring to was non-GAAP OpEx growth. We've excluded the charitable contribution from now. We included in our GAAP results, but excluded it from non-GAAP in order to provide more clarity around the trends and the operating investments we're making in the business. So when we talked about mid-teens growth sequentially in OpEx, I was referring to non-GAAP OpEx, stripping out the impact of the $20 million charitable contribution that we reported last quarter. What that reflects is, it reflects an increase in the year-over-year growth rate and headcount from where we were last quarter at 17%. And then we're going to \u2013 as we mentioned, start to rollout comprehension marketing campaigns for the first time later in Q2.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks Todd. Thanks Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got two. Ben, I think when you were talking earlier about Story Pins and opening it up to more creators, curious, could you give us a sense if you were looking at sort of end of Q1 or even where you are today versus where you were in Q4. How many people are now have Story Pins available to them and what is it doing like? Can you give us any sense of like as users are engaging with Story Pins, what it means to either time spent monetization or both? And then sort of just a bigger picture for both you and Todd. As you think about sort of connecting brands with creators, you're certainly giving creators more of a way to be on the platform and to create unique content. Wondering as you look at sort of the ad units, we're seeing more and more video throughout Pinterest, but a lot of them are sort of what I would call video ads you could see elsewhere on the Internet. How do you start to begin to get brands to actually work with kind of native Pinterest creators so that ad units feel more natively Pinterest and something really unique to Pinterest versus just video that could be anywhere? I'd be curious of your thoughts on both of those.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. So the first part of your question is kind of where are we in the rollout of Story Pins on the creator side and an audience side, and what do we know about its impact on things like time spent and monetization. And briefly we're still in very early days. So the number of Story Pins has increased substantially and across Q1, it roughly doubled quarter-over-quarter, but it was off a small base. And just to give a little bit of visibility, we've started small and we're expanding slowly for two reasons. The first is that a lot of what Pinterest brand is anchored in is positivity. And so we wanted to set a really high bar for the content safety and set the tone for what the platform is. So when you look at things like the Creator Code, which was our norms and guidelines for what kind of content creators have to agree to before they publish content, even to the examples of the types of Story Pins that we're promoting and talking about. They're really trying to set the tone for the future and that tone is around positivity, but it's also around actionability, and small ideas that might be used again and again. Things like, [indiscernible] breakfast or how to reorganize your kitchen, things that can actually build a library of useful content. The second reason that we've started a little bit smaller, although we're now preparing to expand that more broadly is that we're really trying to build a new supply demand marketplace inside of Pinterest. So today when you use Pinterest, we recommend content and we have done so for years without the need to follow or subscribe to anyone. We take a look at what you've pinned, what you've saved, and we recommend things to you in the future. And that's a pretty optimized system. With Story Pins, we're taking a small group of high-quality creators, and we're asking them to publish it and we're teaching users how to follow, so they see more. So I think it's a little bit too early to say with confidence exactly what we're seeing in time spent monetization. That said, we are doing it because we think it's going to make the service more engaging and more useful over the long-term. We think there's a good market presence for that and we really are encouraged by the early signs. I just don't want it too early come out, and have people kind of modeling based on such an early set of data. I think your second question really was about how does that translate into more native ad experiences? And I'll let Todd sort of add anything to it. But we're already seeing examples of where brands and creators are teaming up to create a really authentic and inspiring image. So one example is Toyota who partnered with creators to show the types of people that have minivans and how they fit into their lives and kind of paint a really realistic picture versus kind of a veneered kind of entertainment-based picture that they might be able to experience on other platforms. And the response from Toyota and their brand managers was really great in terms of brand perception and favoribility consideration. And so that's an example. We provided some other examples in our last earnings call, but we do think there's a great opportunity both by kind of matching people up in the market and then by building new tools, which may let creators more directly share products and services they love with their audiences.\nRichard Greenfield: Are those things you would expect to rollout throughout 2021? Those types of tools you're talking about?\nBenjamin Silbermann: I think that you'll see different ways for creators to engage directly with Pinners throughout the year. Yes.\nRichard Greenfield: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to revisit some of your earlier comments, just on the U.S., you talked about moving more in mid-March, just the easing of restrictions, how you saw slower U.S. MAU growth and lowered engagement. Just curious did that reflect as well in terms of U.S. revenue growth or was your point in Ross' earlier question just that, it's fairly disconnected \u2013 revenue growth is fairly disconnected right now from users in the engagement just given the higher pricing that you're seeing? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. I mean, I understand the question. We talked about them as being fairly different phenomena. I think we had a little bit of unwinding towards the end of March as people started to go outside from a monthly active user and engagement perspective. But I think Ben spoke before, a lot of our shopping-oriented engagement was very resilient. So yes, I don't want that to be a misunderstood. We've had like a remarkable increase in the number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces. Our product searches were up 20-fold. And so that's something not to dismiss. And we doubled our attributed conversions in the quarter as well, which speaks to some of that more at funnel behavior. But given the upside we have in terms of our product investments, all the automation work we've done, the upside in our sales coverage and diversifying into the mid-market, and in addition, internationally, continuing to rollout that has been a lot of upside. So we were actually \u2013 I think we ended up increasing our ad impressions 22% globally in the quarter. And our effective CPMs are realized, pricing was up 46% just to give you a sense globally of how that happened. And our ad load was actually down on a year-over-year basis in the U.S. and globally, which is pretty interesting fact to consider when you think about that question that you pose.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay. That's helpful. And just to follow-up, I mean, I would suggest obviously higher ROI, but I guess, are you seeing kind of the increases in auction density that you've been looking for as you built out the number of advertisers on the platform?\nTodd Morgenfeld: We are definitely seeing benefits from advertiser diversification in a number of ways. I think it starts Doug with one of the things we've talked about for the last couple of years. We really want ads to feel increasingly-led content to our users because of the mindset that they bring. And by diversifying our advertiser base across verticals and into the mid-market, we've been increasingly able to do that. And so I think that's kind of where it starts, but we've also seen benefits when it comes to auction density, but I would point again to more efficient use of our monetizable supply built against that commercial mindset and planning behavior that our users bring. That's the biggest driver of our performance.\nDouglas Anmuth: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This will be our last question, Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Have a couple of questions as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the growth in the Gen Z on the platform, their activity, which you've highlighted a couple of times in the call. If there's any context \u2013 additional context around how much that group now represents of users or activity, or where are you seeing as an offset less engagements, which cohorts or which generations? And then outside of your comments on recent user trends, I just wanted to follow-up on advertiser activity. I think, Todd, you're making the point that you're seeing strong growth or engagement with advertisers in spite of some of the sequential trends in users. I just want to clarify that because I know that question has been coming up. Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure, Colin. So starting with Gen Z, we've mentioned for a few quarters in the row that we're seeing continued growth and they're growing part of our user base, but we're far from being penetrated entirely. They do have slightly different interests, categories than our historical user base. So there's over-representation of interest in art, entertainment, women's fashion, there's less of a pronounced interest in things like home decor. They tend to be more engaged with native content relative to our historical cohorts. Things like video, there is some other early adopters of products like Story Pins or they tend to have a higher activation rate and they tend to have a higher retention rate. So those are a few of the trends that we're observing with that group of users. We haven't yet started building features that cater to them specifically. But we're excited to see how they use the platform, learn how we can serve them better, while still making sure that we're consistent with our kind of overall mission, and bringing people inspiration to create a life they love.\nBenjamin Silbermann: And then Colin on the advertiser activity, I'll try again on this one maybe from a different perspective or angle. It's probably \u2013 I don't know if the question is really around the 78% growth we posted this quarter versus [70%, I think it was 6%] in Q4 with a slightly easier end of quarter comp. But it's worth just remembering where we were in Q4. We had a longer shopping season. It was started earlier and ended longer. So it was a big shopping season for us. And then we had unusually strong election year-driven social media avoidance on other platforms that we benefited from that proceeded a bit in Q1. But I thought our performance was exceptionally strong on a global basis and the team executed really well across product and go-to-market. And we're seeing that in terms of \u2013 one way of thinking about it in terms of advertiser activity is that our number of joint business partnerships, which are indications of intent to spend. The number of joint business partnerships doubled year-to-date versus last year. So that's an indicator of how we're thinking about the advertising demand. Does that help?\nColin Sebastian: Yes. It does help. I think the question is also related to if user trends are flattening sequentially or down sequentially, is there a risk that advertisers will follow that sort of looking out versus what their activity is right now?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Well, I think, if you look back over the last couple of years, we've been on a steady upward trend. I think we grew \u2013 if you strip away the impact from what we think, but probably some pulled forward users last year into the COVID period. We're still up north of 6% in the U.S. compounded over the last couple of years. And so that \u2013 and that's been relatively consistent with the longer-term trend in terms of users. And I think the investments we're making in the shopping experience in a more compelling user experience and these new formats around the native content ecosystem are going to be really exciting for advertisers to participate in.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Thanks guys.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks.\nJane Penner: I think that ends our call for today. That was our last question. And so we're ready to close it out. Thanks so much everyone. We'll see you next quarter.\nBenjamin Silbermann: Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We'll keep the dialog going, until then we just hope everyone stay safe and takes care of themselves. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. I'll share some further details on the trends we saw in the first quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for Q2. Let's start with a quick summary of the headlines, and then we'll go into more detail. As Ben mentioned, we had a really strong first quarter. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 78%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 17%. Monthly active user growth remains strong with all regions, once again showing good momentum. First quarter revenue growth was propelled by two main drivers. First, we saw strong momentum from mid-market and managed small advertisers who are increasingly finding value in our conversion-focused ad products and the automation of our ad stack  Second, our international business performed really well, growing 170% year-over-year in the first quarter. We are seeing the highest growth in Western Europe and Canada, where we are continuing to expand our sales coverage. Both of these trends show in the growth and diversification of our advertiser base. The drivers of our growth in the first quarter, including performance ads products for small and medium-sized businesses, automation and advertiser diversification, probably sound familiar because we've been talking about our investment in them since our IPO a couple of years ago. As we begin to dig into newer strategic initiatives, such as building a native content ecosystem, I think it's worth taking a minute to draw your attention to our playbook for these kinds of investments. In general, our philosophy is to deliver value to Pinners first, then lean into scale and monetize. This worked well for the international rollout of our ads business, as well as for our shopping initiative. For international, we executed a blueprint for ad sales in the U.S. before scaling it globally. We knew that global users were there to support an expansion, but we got the gears working properly in the U.S. before leaning in. This worked well. We are serving ads in 29 countries today and international revenue comprised almost 20% of total revenue in the first quarter. And we just launched in our first Latin American country, Brazil with Mexico coming in May. For shopping, we prioritize building an organic shopping experience for Pinners with high-quality inventory, catalog uploads and discovery services before really leaning into monetization. This strategy has also been very effective to-date though it's still relatively early days. Not only have we dramatically scaled shopping engagement on the platform, we shared for the first time today, that ad revenue from retailers optimizing for sales on Pinterest is now a meaningful part of our financial performance. In both our international ads rollout and in shopping, we serve the Pinner first by getting the fundamental infrastructure in place and only then scaling and monetizing the experience. We are running the same playbook as we build a native content ecosystem. We are currently focused on delivering value to Pinners by making it easier for creators to make great content and learning the optimal mechanisms to distribute that content. It's very early in our journey to achieve scale or drive meaningful monetization at this point. We are currently investing R&D and sales and marketing resources to get our content ecosystem off the ground and we are confident that we understand how best to deliver value to Pinners, we will lean in harder to scale and monetize. That may take the form of additional investment, but it's too early to know exactly what that looks like today. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q2. Ben mentioned that we have both headwinds and potential tailwinds for engagement and MAU growth that may play out over the next couple of quarters. In Q2, we expect global monthly active users to grow in the mid-teens and U.S. monthly active users to be about flat on a year-over-year percentage basis. We expect to grow revenue about 105% year-over-year in Q2. As we think about the first quarter and the full-year, we believe the momentum and returns we are seeing from our investments and ad tools and sales coverage expansion should continue. Starting at the end of March, we began to lap easier year-ago revenue comparisons, which will continue through Q2 and is factored into our guidance. Before opening up for questions, I also want to touch on expenses. We continue to invest in the growth of the business in accordance with our big strategic priorities of inspiring content, Pinner experience, advertiser success, and shopping. In the first quarter, we grew our headcount 17% year-over-year. We expect our sequential non-GAAP OpEx growth to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis as we continue to ramp investments in our long-term initiatives and growth drivers. And as a reminder, we are investing in marketing campaigns to bolster comprehension and brand awareness throughout the year. Those campaign launches in Q2 will drive a substantial and sizable increase in our variable spend. Thank you to the teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ross. So understand the question really about user growth and the connection to revenue. So I'll go through a couple of things, and hopefully this gets to the essence of the question. I would say sequentially, we are unwinding some of the pulled forward user growth that we had last year and some of the engagement from the unprecedented COVID period that we all went through over the last year. It's kind of an exacerbated version of the typical seasonality that we would see going into the summer, but compounded by unwinding some of the restrictions that we had around COVID. We are also \u2013 it's worth noting, making, as I mentioned, investments in comprehension marketing, and a lot of what Ben talked about around our creators and native content efforts are designed to drive long-term engagement. So I don't want to believe that pun intended too. But it's really worth noting and this is something that I'm glad you asked about. It's worth noting that our investments to more efficiently utilize our unique engagement, that commercial mindset and planning behavior that Pinners bring to Pinterest, it's working. We've made investments in product and in sales coverage. As we talked last time, our vision over the long-term is to how advertisers bring their budget, their goals and their content, and we automate the rest. And while we have a long way to go before we get there, we've made it a lot easier for advertisers to onboard scale and see results, especially in the SMB space. And we did that through especially ROI accountable conversion-led performance ads that generate higher potential effective CPMs over time. We saw that unfold over the course of last year through automated bidding across traffic, conversion optimization and shopping objectives. We are working on a similar automation exercise now called campaign budget optimization, which allows for better delivery across ad groups instead of just within ad groups, so continuing that automation theme. And we will launch automated bidding for awareness objectives over the course of this year, too. So that long-term trend around automation continues. We've accelerated further through partnerships like the one with Shopify, it will be expanded internationally. We've partnered all that investment in products through an improved coverage model. We focused on growing our managed SMB coverage, which has now nearly half of our revenue. And you saw the results we've posted internationally with opening new markets in places like Brazil and Mexico next at nearly 20% of our revenue, that's up significantly as a percentage of our mix. But what I wanted to make sure, we highlight, and I think this is your question, is that we are more efficiently using or utilizing the unique engagement that we have on Pinterest and that strategy is working. So when you boil it down to your question about ad impressions and realized pricing or effective CPMs, our revenue growth was mostly driven by effective CPM gains in the quarter versus impressions, especially in our performance products. And the thing that most stood out to me was that our ad load in the U.S. and globally actually ticked down in the first quarter year-over-year, despite U.S. revenue growing 65% and overall revenue growing 78%. So we are much more efficiently using \u2013 utilizing the ad supply that we have because we've automated \u2013 we've built the right products with the right automation and ads are working for advertisers on the platform. Does that get to your question? Thanks, Mark. So I heard two questions in there. The first was around new revenue models that could be associated with native checkout, and the second was around how that ARPU trend may look over time and drivers. So on the new revenue model point, I think it's probably worth pausing and going back to what some of the opening comments I had about what we endeavor to do when we make new investments. I was really excited last year when we said \u2013 we know our users come to find inspiration and then create real action out of those inspirational items that they get off of Pinterest. And so we focused on getting the right inventory of shoppable products on the platform and to make those products discoverable for our users. So that was the first way of addressing that desire to buy \u2013 that our users express some desire to buy what they found on Pinterest. Through all the work on catalog uploads and work on the organic product to serve more natural shopping journeys that users go through, we were able to fulfill that request. And so as Ben mentioned, the next step might be later in the year testing native checkout. I would say we're trying to make sure that the user experience works first. And we're not committing at this point to any new revenue models. But over the longer-term that's something we could evaluate. Second, on the ARPU opportunity. I think what I was mentioning before around all of the investments we've made in product and in coverage, bringing with a long-term goal of having advertisers bringing their budget, their goals, and their content, and automating the rest, serving especially the SMB market and diversifying our advertiser base, allowing them to easily onboard scale and see results from their spend. We've had a great track record over the last year of delivering that kind of automation and we've invested in exactly the right sales coverage model in the U.S. and internationally to generate demand against that. That has been the recipe for driving ARPU growth. I think we posted 50% ARPU growth in the U.S. last quarter as a result of all of those investments in product and coverage. We've seen that that model works in international markets too are seeing great traction. And as I mentioned, we're now at nearly 20% of our overall revenue from international markets through a similar playbook. It's a playbook that we built as a first step in some of the English-speaking countries outside of the U.S. and then refined in Western Europe, most notably in France and Germany and are now rolling out. It's very, very early days, but are now rolling out in Latin America. We've talked historically about how Pinners come to our platform with a similar mindset in international markets. And so a lot of the international opportunity is really down to execution, and I think we've got the right team in place to deliver against that over time. I'm super encouraged by the progress we've made and the opportunity ahead. And Lloyd, the only thing I would really add to that. I think that's a good summary of the user experience that we are building toward. But as an advertiser, you can imagine that maps, that user journey maps really well to advertising objectives ranging from awareness to consideration to purchase. And one of the things that we hear when we talk to CMOs is the value of Pinterest as a full funnel advertising experience across all of those objectives. But as attributed conversions and purchase activity has increased, that was the reason we called out the stat about 20% of our revenue coming from retailers with conversion objectives because it's an important trend. A lot of our early business was built around awareness and consideration objectives or traffic baseline. But what we've seen recently is that shopping ads or catalog-based ads, coupled with conversion optimization ads with checkout or add-to-cart objectives are now for the retail community are now 20% of our overall revenue. And that seems like a mouthful, but it's designed to show exactly what Ben described. The user experience is more lower funnel, and we're increasingly taking our users from inspiration to action through that purchase journey, and it's showing up in our advertising results. And Justin on the expense side, I'll break that down a little bit. I think there was a question in there about the charitable contribution and how that would be treated, and then how we're thinking about OpEx versus cost of revenue. As a reminder, cost of revenue scales with our user growth and product complexity, so that's more tied to our user growth forecast and tends to be disconnected from revenue performance. It's much more seasonal than our user growth. What I was referring to was non-GAAP OpEx growth. We've excluded the charitable contribution from now. We included in our GAAP results, but excluded it from non-GAAP in order to provide more clarity around the trends and the operating investments we're making in the business. So when we talked about mid-teens growth sequentially in OpEx, I was referring to non-GAAP OpEx, stripping out the impact of the $20 million charitable contribution that we reported last quarter. What that reflects is, it reflects an increase in the year-over-year growth rate and headcount from where we were last quarter at 17%. And then we're going to \u2013 as we mentioned, start to rollout comprehension marketing campaigns for the first time later in Q2. Yes. I mean, I understand the question. We talked about them as being fairly different phenomena. I think we had a little bit of unwinding towards the end of March as people started to go outside from a monthly active user and engagement perspective. But I think Ben spoke before, a lot of our shopping-oriented engagement was very resilient. So yes, I don't want that to be a misunderstood. We've had like a remarkable increase in the number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces. Our product searches were up 20-fold. And so that's something not to dismiss. And we doubled our attributed conversions in the quarter as well, which speaks to some of that more at funnel behavior. But given the upside we have in terms of our product investments, all the automation work we've done, the upside in our sales coverage and diversifying into the mid-market, and in addition, internationally, continuing to rollout that has been a lot of upside. So we were actually \u2013 I think we ended up increasing our ad impressions 22% globally in the quarter. And our effective CPMs are realized, pricing was up 46% just to give you a sense globally of how that happened. And our ad load was actually down on a year-over-year basis in the U.S. and globally, which is pretty interesting fact to consider when you think about that question that you pose. We are definitely seeing benefits from advertiser diversification in a number of ways. I think it starts Doug with one of the things we've talked about for the last couple of years. We really want ads to feel increasingly-led content to our users because of the mindset that they bring. And by diversifying our advertiser base across verticals and into the mid-market, we've been increasingly able to do that. And so I think that's kind of where it starts, but we've also seen benefits when it comes to auction density, but I would point again to more efficient use of our monetizable supply built against that commercial mindset and planning behavior that our users bring. That's the biggest driver of our performance. Sure, Colin. So starting with Gen Z, we've mentioned for a few quarters in the row that we're seeing continued growth and they're growing part of our user base, but we're far from being penetrated entirely. They do have slightly different interests, categories than our historical user base. So there's over-representation of interest in art, entertainment, women's fashion, there's less of a pronounced interest in things like home decor. They tend to be more engaged with native content relative to our historical cohorts. Things like video, there is some other early adopters of products like Story Pins or they tend to have a higher activation rate and they tend to have a higher retention rate. So those are a few of the trends that we're observing with that group of users. We haven't yet started building features that cater to them specifically. But we're excited to see how they use the platform, learn how we can serve them better, while still making sure that we're consistent with our kind of overall mission, and bringing people inspiration to create a life they love. Well, I think, if you look back over the last couple of years, we've been on a steady upward trend. I think we grew \u2013 if you strip away the impact from what we think, but probably some pulled forward users last year into the COVID period. We're still up north of 6% in the U.S. compounded over the last couple of years. And so that \u2013 and that's been relatively consistent with the longer-term trend in terms of users. And I think the investments we're making in the shopping experience in a more compelling user experience and these new formats around the native content ecosystem are going to be really exciting for advertisers to participate in. Thanks."

            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thanks, Jane, and thanks everyone for joining today. I just want to start by acknowledging that last March was the start of the pandemic and we are not still fully through it. Leading through this difficult time has been a humbling experience and I am deeply proud of everyone at Pinterest for their commitment to our teams, to our partners and to our Pinners. I am also proud that during the challenging time, we've shared inspiration with hundreds of millions of people around the world and help businesses reach customers when their physical storefronts may have been closed. Like all of you, I look forward to seeing the pandemic end and look forward to a time when we can be together once again. Now today, Todd is going to go into specifics regarding our financial results, and I'll talk about how we are thinking about Pinterest as we begin to come out of the pandemic. But I want to start by saying that this is a strong quarter. We are confident in our strategy and excited about the investments we are making. Let me offer some more details. First, more people are using Pinterest to inspire and plan their lives than ever before. Our monthly active users grew 30% to more than 478 million users globally with strong growth coming from Gen Z, a persistent trend that we've seen for several quarters. We also saw product searches grow more than 20x year-over-year. Increasingly, people see Pinterest as a place to not only get inspired, but also to shop. Second, our business is strong. Advertisers are inspiring Pinners and they are generating sales on Pinterest. We grew revenue 78% year-over-year, driven by more small-to-mid-sized advertisers and further international expansion. Businesses appreciate that Pinterest is a positive place where people are coming to get new ideas for their lives. Well targeted ads make Pinterest more useful rather than being a distraction for what people are there to do. And these businesses are seeing strong business results, driven significantly by the investments we made to make our advertising products more effective and easier to use. Third, we are working to help people feel more inspired in every aspect of their life, and that starts with giving people the most inspiring content. We continue to invest in new inspiring forms of content like Story Pins. Story Pins on Pinterest are different from stories and other platforms. They are less about what somebody else did and more about what you could do now and in the future. Unlike stories and other platforms, they never disappear and they don't just show up for followers. They show up for anybody looking for an idea like yours, like what you need to do to get your home decorated that dinner made without workout done. In Q1, we started distributing Story Pins more broadly throughout our creator ecosystem, and we are excited by the uptake we are already seeing. As we continue to distribute Story Pins, Pinners will need to learn new ways to navigate and use Pinterest. This could change engagement in the coming quarters, but we are confident that over time investing in new media formats like Story Pins will inspire our community, provide new ways to engage with Pinterest more deeply and create new revenue opportunities for creators and businesses alike. We are also making it easier for Pinners to take out as they see and make them real. The number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces of Pinterest has grown over 200% in the last year as Pinners look to go from inspiration to purchase. At the end of Q1, revenue from retailers with sales objectives were 20% of total revenue, and all of this shows that we are making a real traction with shopping on Pinterest. And to next step, we are excited to begin testing seamless on-platform transactions later this year. And finally, we continue to expand our business globally. We launched advertising in Brazil this quarter, an important milestone in growing our global ads business. We expanded our Shopify integration to 27 additional countries to help us further build Pinterest as a destination for shopping. And for the first time, our international business is nearly 20% of total revenue. We are seeing a lot of strengths in our business, but it's important to note that since the pandemic began, we've seen a correlation between stay-at-home orders and engagement on Pinterest. Pinterest has always been popular for home improvement, recipe collection and lesson planning, and naturally many of us did more of these things during our time at home, which brought more people to Pinterest in 2020. As pandemic lockdowns were eased in some parts of the world during mid-March, we began to see signs of less engagement and user growth on Pinterest, and we assume this means people are spending more time offline. While it's impossible to say how people act as we enter the summer months, we anticipate this trend will continue. Finally, I'd like to note that like the entire online advertising industry, we're faced with changes to the privacy landscape. We've talked for over a year about the steps we are taking to ensure advertisers understand the effectiveness of their ads, while also keeping Pinner privacy in mind. This includes investments in new first-party solutions enhancements to ad targeting. People naturally come to Pinterest to search, shop and find ideas for brands and creators. Personalization based on its onset activity won't be affected by the upcoming changes. That said, it's still early days, it is not yet clear what the long-term impact will be. To close, I'd like to note that this past year has reinforced the importance of our mission. Pinterest is not the place to read the news or debate politics with your cousin or compare yourself to other people. It is a positive place to be inspired and get ideas in your future life. This is reflected in our content and ad policies, our efforts to combat COVID vaccine misinformation, our new creator code and comment moderation tools designed to keep new content formats positive and inspiring and our continued focus in engineering products for positivity with new inclusive search features like skin tone ranges now available in 13 countries. I am excited about how far we've come over a challenging year and even more excited about where we go in the future. I'll now pass it on to Todd. Sure. Brian, I can start off. Your first question is really about users and engagement. And what I heard was, it seems like there are a lot of core categories that could be quite resilient on how are we thinking about that post-COVID. So taking a step back, Todd mentioned a couple of times that the way we see it is that during COVID, people spend a lot more time online. They spend a lot more time creating new patterns and behaviors for their stay-at-home life and Pinterest was the beneficiary of that. And as thankfully, we want more people spend time outside their home out there in the world and we expect some of that engagement to go away. That said, I'd observe a few things, one of which that you brought up. First, in a lot of the core categories, particularly the commercially strong categories, things like interior design, fashion, we're still seeing a really good resilience. And we have early data that indicates that engagement in those core commercial categories is going to be stickier than engagement overall. And we think that's a good thing. That's evidenced in the strength and uptick in shopping surfaces, the significant increase in the number of shopping-related searches, as well as what we've seen in overall user behavior. Second, as you mentioned, there could be certain tailwinds, but we try to communicate what we've seen rather than what we think in the future. To your point, historically, certain events, whether it's Halloween, holidays, wedding planning, they were big drivers and engagement on Pinterest. We saw that go away, but the net time online kind of went over that during the pandemic. So there could be tailwinds and we're just not baking them in. And so all of that paints a picture where we do expect, as Todd mentioned, a flattish growth in the U.S., but over the long-term, we think there's a lot to be optimistic about. In addition to the constant efforts that we're undertaking now, we mentioned that we're going to be doing our first brand campaign and generally just improving the quality of the Pinner experience over the long-term. So that's how we're kind of thinking about those pieces coming together. Before going on, does that kind of answer your question? Okay. The second question I heard was really about IDFA and what are the thoughts that we have on particularly shopping to help retailers to get a little bit closer to Pinterest when they're near that point of transaction. So as an overview, and this is obviously new territory, but we've been talking about it kind of with the community for more than a year. We put in place efforts to improve first-party measurement solutions, few things like shopping solutions. But more to the point, we've also really increased the amount of engagement that Pinners have on shopping surfaces more directly. This year, for example, we allow Pinterest users to pivot any search into a shopping search and that significantly increased engagement on shopping surfaces. This has been part of our strategy all along. If you rewind a couple of quarters, our strategy was, one, we're going to increase the amount of high-quality inventory with things like our catalog uploader, which we expanded with multi-feed, as well as our partnerships with folks like Shopify. It was, two, to make it easier for Pinners to get to those products and that's exemplified and increased the number of shopping surfaces as well as being able to pivot from search to shopping search. The next step in that journey will be early pilots in testing seamless checkout and removing the friction. I mean, that's been the sequence that we're pursuing for a while and early results are really good. Lloyd, I can start with the first part and then maybe Todd can kind of add more to the second one. The question as I understood it was, do we feel that users on the platform are really going through more of the funnel who has seen Pinterest increasingly adds the destination to shop? And the answer to that, in short is yes. So if we rewind a little bit and think about kind of where our strategy was a couple of years ago, we knew there was a lot of commercial intent on the platform. But a major painpoint for Pinners was they weren't able to get to the product and then to make it purchase plan easy way. And so the first thing that we really worked on was increasing the amount of shoppable inventory. And as mentioned before, things like the increase in the number of catalog uploads, it's up 14x in the last 12 trailing months has really improved the quality of the inventory. The next step then was to begin showing users that when they were on a piece of content, they could find high-quality products with up-to-date metadata. And that's been sort of the second leg of the stool. So increasingly, if you use Pinterest, when you see a product, you'll find that there's up-to-date pricing information and stock information, and that's the continuous improvement in quality. Over the last quarter and a half, I would say where we've seen real traction is then beginning to let users pivot from what we might call inspiration mode into shopping mode by engaging in shopping on these surfaces. Some of those surfaces are pivots off things like search. Others are looking underneath a large image pen and then being able to go into a feed of related products connected either by a similar look, a similar brand or a similar price point. We think that engagement with those surfaces is indicative of higher shopping intent. And we noticed really strong purchasing behavior off of those surfaces. So now that those foundational pieces are laid, the next thing we want to test is removing friction from the transaction. And that's something, again that we'll pilot, as Todd mentioned, try to get the experience really good and then begin to roll it out more broadly. So I think the short answer is yes, the longer answer is that's the journey we're on. It's not going to be a flip to switch. But we're hearing from Pinners, we're seeing an engagement in shopping surfaces. We're seeing in the growth an attributable conversion that Pinners are increasingly seeing it as a place where they can not only get inspired, but they can also buy. Thanks for the question, Justin. What I heard was in more mature markets where do we see growth coming from? So we said over the last few quarters that there's a sustained trend, particularly Gen Z users are engaging with Pinterest more and more. I think that's pretty interesting because historically Pinterest has attracted a lot of millennials and folks that are a little bit older. And there was a question mark on whether Gen Z users who have a strong interest in socializing with their friends are also interested in investing time to get creative ideas for themselves and explore their hobbies and interests. And I think that what we've seen as the answer to that is it's resounding, yes, while there are some category overlaps, there are also category differences. We see \u2013 this is a group of users that loves fashion. They love exploring their creativity. They're looking now more and more into things like food. This is a group that's not yet really looking into decorating. And so it kind of reflects the same spirit of what Pinterest is about, but at a different stage of life and we see a lot of growth opportunity there. Past that, we do see two big opportunities to just improve the quality of the experience both utility and how inspirational it is. I spoke a little bit about Story Pins as a new media format, and we're talking about it as new, but it really follows a trend that we've been working on for a while and talking about of moving from just imagery to videos and then to interactive videos. So for the last couple of quarters and we talked there's been an enormous increase in the amount of video consumption. That's reflected in the amount of time people are spending in watching videos, it's reflected in a disproportionate contribution to ad revenue. I mean, we think that Story Pins are the next step in that evolution. So letting people have a closed loop where they can publish directly onto the platform, they can engage users, not about entertainment, but about their interests. And those users can contribute back and can build more of a community around that media. We think that's something that's different. It's not really a new that's met in the market in the same way that Pinterest is approaching it. And so while we don't forecast that into growth because it's early days, we think long-term, it's something that's going to really improve the growth and the engagement on the platform. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. So the first part of your question is kind of where are we in the rollout of Story Pins on the creator side and an audience side, and what do we know about its impact on things like time spent and monetization. And briefly we're still in very early days. So the number of Story Pins has increased substantially and across Q1, it roughly doubled quarter-over-quarter, but it was off a small base. And just to give a little bit of visibility, we've started small and we're expanding slowly for two reasons. The first is that a lot of what Pinterest brand is anchored in is positivity. And so we wanted to set a really high bar for the content safety and set the tone for what the platform is. So when you look at things like the Creator Code, which was our norms and guidelines for what kind of content creators have to agree to before they publish content, even to the examples of the types of Story Pins that we're promoting and talking about. They're really trying to set the tone for the future and that tone is around positivity, but it's also around actionability, and small ideas that might be used again and again. Things like, [indiscernible] breakfast or how to reorganize your kitchen, things that can actually build a library of useful content. The second reason that we've started a little bit smaller, although we're now preparing to expand that more broadly is that we're really trying to build a new supply demand marketplace inside of Pinterest. So today when you use Pinterest, we recommend content and we have done so for years without the need to follow or subscribe to anyone. We take a look at what you've pinned, what you've saved, and we recommend things to you in the future. And that's a pretty optimized system. With Story Pins, we're taking a small group of high-quality creators, and we're asking them to publish it and we're teaching users how to follow, so they see more. So I think it's a little bit too early to say with confidence exactly what we're seeing in time spent monetization. That said, we are doing it because we think it's going to make the service more engaging and more useful over the long-term. We think there's a good market presence for that and we really are encouraged by the early signs. I just don't want it too early come out, and have people kind of modeling based on such an early set of data. I think your second question really was about how does that translate into more native ad experiences? And I'll let Todd sort of add anything to it. But we're already seeing examples of where brands and creators are teaming up to create a really authentic and inspiring image. So one example is Toyota who partnered with creators to show the types of people that have minivans and how they fit into their lives and kind of paint a really realistic picture versus kind of a veneered kind of entertainment-based picture that they might be able to experience on other platforms. And the response from Toyota and their brand managers was really great in terms of brand perception and favoribility consideration. And so that's an example. We provided some other examples in our last earnings call, but we do think there's a great opportunity both by kind of matching people up in the market and then by building new tools, which may let creators more directly share products and services they love with their audiences. I think that you'll see different ways for creators to engage directly with Pinners throughout the year. Yes. And then Colin on the advertiser activity, I'll try again on this one maybe from a different perspective or angle. It's probably \u2013 I don't know if the question is really around the 78% growth we posted this quarter versus [70%, I think it was 6%] in Q4 with a slightly easier end of quarter comp. But it's worth just remembering where we were in Q4. We had a longer shopping season. It was started earlier and ended longer. So it was a big shopping season for us. And then we had unusually strong election year-driven social media avoidance on other platforms that we benefited from that proceeded a bit in Q1. But I thought our performance was exceptionally strong on a global basis and the team executed really well across product and go-to-market. And we're seeing that in terms of \u2013 one way of thinking about it in terms of advertiser activity is that our number of joint business partnerships, which are indications of intent to spend. The number of joint business partnerships doubled year-to-date versus last year. So that's an indicator of how we're thinking about the advertising demand. Does that help? Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We'll keep the dialog going, until then we just hope everyone stay safe and takes care of themselves. Enjoy the rest of your day."

Hi everyone and thank you for joining our Q4 earnings call. I'm proud of our team's focus and execution over the past year and in particular Q4. We reinvested in our core product experience that led to deepening engagement and a return to user growth. We built and shipped new ad tech and measurement solutions that resulted in improved returns for our advertisers. And we're just getting started. I have strong conviction that we will continue to innovate and deliver value to our users and business partners. We grew global MAUs in Q4 to 450 million, up both sequentially and year-over-year. Our global mobile app users which account for over 80% of our impressions and revenue grew 14% and our US and Canada mobile app users grew 5%, accelerating from last quarter. More importantly, sessions continue to grow significantly faster than users, demonstrating deepening engagement per user as we focus on driving greater per user monetization. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $877 million growing 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis, roughly in line with our mid-single-digit guidance range. Strength came from large US retail advertisers and international markets, excluding the impact of FX as these advertisers leaned into our full funnel platform during the holiday season. However, this strength was partially offset by CPG advertisers, as well as small and mid-market advertisers in the US who faced headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. For the full year we generated revenue of $2.8 billion, growing 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased with our results this quarter despite headwinds from the softening ad market, which Todd will speak to later. We remain confident in our long-term strategy in our ability to execute and drive value for users and advertisers. We're also increasing operational rigor and have taken actions to control costs in Q4. For example, we significantly slowed the pace of hiring such that our headcount was flat quarter-over-quarter. We reduced our infrastructure spend, which declined sequentially, despite strong engagement volume increases, and we closed some of our smaller offices for future cost savings. These actions put us on the path to meaningful EBITDA margin expansion in 2023 and demonstrate our focus on generating strong cash flow. As we build upon the solid foundation we set in 2022, we're laser focused on our four strategic priorities: one, growing monetization and engagement per user; two, integrating shopping into the core of the product experience; three, improving operational rigor and therefore, margin expansion; and four, strengthening our leadership as a positive and brand-safe platform. First, as I mentioned last quarter, we're focused on growing monetization per user. Given the users come to our platform with intent to make, do or shop, we are well positioned to achieve this by deepening user engagement, driving more intent to action and helping advertisers better monetize our supply. On deepening user engagement, we believe that we have a large opportunity to grow the frequency of engagement from episodic users. On top of our 450 million MAUs, hundreds of millions of logged in users come to Pinterest episodically. In 2023, we're pursuing more ways to bring these users back more often and to find the next use case by leveraging our machine learning models and building new experiences for them. We're also continuing the work, we began last year to serve more personalized, relevant and ultimately more engaging content. This effort has already yielded results, including our return to MAU growth and double-digit growth in mobile app users. However, we have more opportunity to leverage the unique first-party signal on our platform. Our users save and organize content to boards and active human curation at scale that is unique to Pinterest. This gives us insights into emerging trends and product associations as well as the ability to assist users when they have intent but have not yet decided what to buy. We're actively working to refresh the Pinterest board experience to make it easier for users to organize their interest, which should yield more and higher-quality signals. This, in turn, enables us to deliver increasingly relevant and timely content recommendations. I'm particularly excited about the work we've done to bring new and emerging demographics onto the platform. In Q4, Gen Z was once again our fastest-growing cohort, growing double digits and accelerating from Q3. We're building an experience that resonates with this audience on Pinterest, specifically around video. In fact, nearly half of all new videos pinned in Q4 were from Gen Z users. And in Q4, Gen Z sessions grew much faster than sessions from our other demographics. As I discussed last quarter, video also drives deeper engagement. We remain focused on growing our supply of videos from multiple sources, including creators, brands and publishers. Last quarter, we grew our supply of video content 30% quarter-over-quarter. And we recently announced a deal with Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment to create high-quality video content aligned with Pinterest's key seasonal and cultural moments like fashion months, wedding season, summer and back-to-school. We believe high-quality and inspiring content will further deepen engagement, especially for Gen Z. Monetization per user should also be driven by our ads initiatives. Pinterest is unique because users come to our platform with intent, and we are one of the few places where people can go from seeking inspiration to fulfilling that intent through action. And we've built a full ad solution that helps advertisers meet users in their journey across the funnel from top to middle to bottom. In fact, our revenue is roughly split across the funnel with one-third brand, one-third consideration and one-third conversion. We've seen advertisers who take a full funnel approach see more success than those who are only active on one campaign objective. In 2022, advertisers adopting a multi-objective media strategy saw up to a 50% improvement in sales lift compared to those who use one objective based on our conversion [loss] (ph) study. I believe ads when relevant and personalized can be highly valuable content for users, fostering authentic interactions between brands and consumers. In Q4, we launched ad load management with whole page optimization, which flexes ad load opportunistically in context where ads are most well-suited for the user. In our initial testing, this drove double-digit improvements in ad relevance on search, while simultaneously reducing CPAs for advertisers. We expect the whole page optimization will enable us to continue to improve the efficiency with which we monetize our platform over time. In addition, we continue to improve conversion visibility through our measurement solutions in a privacy centric way to demonstrate the value that Pinterest brings to advertisers. For example, in Q4, we launched our conversion API, and we recently integrated this API with Shopify so that merchants can use our conversion measurement tool. Based on our tests, for advertisers using our conversion API with the Pinterest tag, we found an average of 28% lift in the attributed checkout conversions and 14% improvement in the checkout CPA metric. At CES this January, we announced our new privacy safe clean room solution with LiveRamp and Albertsons. Pinterest's integration with LiveRamp provides a protected third-party space where brands can join the first-party data and Pinterest platform data in a secure, privacy safe environment. Our second strategic goal for 2023 is to lean into the high intent that users express on Pinterest by integrating shopping into the core of the product experience. Based on surveys of our users, over 50% say they view Pinterest as a place to shop. Yet we haven't made it easy for them to shop historically as shoppable content was not integrated into core experiences. In our endeavor to make Pinterest the home of taste based shopping, we're integrating shopping across our most traffic surfaces, including home feed, search and related pins to show users products most relevant to them. Over the long-term, we also want to make every pin shoppable. To that end, we're making video content on Pinterest more actionable using the same playbook we applied to static images. Over the course of this year, we will be deploying our computer vision technology across our video corpus to find products and videos and make them shoppable. To make Pinterest more shoppable, we're creating a more seamless handoff by taking the user directly to the product detail page on the merchant's app. To this effort, we continue to deploy our mobile deep linking format, or MDL, on shopping ads. During the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, MDL accounted for 40% of our shopping ads revenue, which grew 50% in Q4. People are shopping on Pinterest, and we are helping merchants find end-market consumers. Third, we're driving operational rigor and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders. While 2022 started off as an investment year, we took steps to cut down on costs in this challenging macroeconomic environment starting in early Q3, and we are continuing to find ways to reduce our expenses so that we can meaningfully expand EBITDA margins. As I've said before, I'm a strong believer that constraints breed creativity, and I believe our teams will deliver more compelling products and experiences that set us up for sustainable growth long-term. Furthermore, Todd and I have been evaluating our broad capital allocation strategy, including investing in the business, maintaining flexibility for strategic acquisitions and options for returning capital to shareholders. Given the significant cash balance at Pinterest today, combined with our robust ongoing operating cash flow generation, we're planning to execute a stock buyback program of up to $500 million, which we plan to commence this quarter to help mitigate dilution from stock-based compensation. Todd will go into more details on our buyback program. Finally, one of the biggest differentiators of Pinterest is that we are an inspirational platform and we're intentionally tuning our business to be a positive place on the Internet. Pinterest's mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. And I believe in an online environment that is increasingly full of toxicity, this is more important than ever. Not only does it help our users, but also our advertisers as they look for more brand-safe environments to attract customers. From a user perspective, we've long been investing in being a more positive platform from products like inclusive search to important business decisions like banning political ads because we want our users to be in a positive space for inspiration and action. Users are noticing this investment. We have research confirming the positivity of our platform and emotional benefit to our users that we're planning to release in the coming weeks. We're seeing this sentiment come through with our advertisers as well. Some of our latest research also shows that ads that appear in a more positive environment drive more purchases at every stage of the funnel. We believe that positivity makes people more open to brands, more likely to remember them, and more driven to purchase. As I mentioned in our last call, I value the communication, input, and feedback with the investor and analyst communities. As part of that, we plan to host an Investor Day later this year, and we'll update you in the future on timing and additional details. Finally, as you may have seen in our press release today, Todd Morgenfeld, our CFO and Head of Business Operations, will transition from the company to pursue new career opportunities on July 1st. Todd has been instrumental to Pinterest's growth over the last six-plus years and is committed to ensuring a smooth transition, while we search for a new CFO. I'd like to take a moment to recognize Todd for his dedication to our employees, our Pinners, advertisers, and our shareholders. Todd has made significant contributions to our business over the last six-plus years, including leading the company's IPO process, helping the company navigate the pandemic, advancing our revenue functions, maturing our business operations, and partnering with me when I joined the company last year. So, Todd, we thank you for your partnership and leadership. Everyone at Pinterest will be cheering for you in your future endeavors, and I intend to be cheering the loudest.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks Bill. I appreciate the kind words and the partnership. I also want to thank the entire Pinterest team and the Board for the opportunity to contribute over the past six years. I look forward to watching the company continue to innovate, execute, and grow. I'll now discuss our results. In my remarks today, I'll talk about our Q4 financial performance and our preliminary Q1 outlook. All financial metrics except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified. And as a reminder, all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In 2022, we made platform-wide innovations that resulted in improving the user experience through more personalized content, showing more relevant products that fit users' tastes and preferences, and delivering increased value to advertisers through ad stack innovation, new measurement solutions, and more seamless handoffs to merchant sites. Even though softening demand lowered ad pricing across the industry, including on our platform, we grew revenue in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we expect our 2022 investments in our ad stack to help deliver competitive cost per action as the demand environment normalizes in the future. As we continue to innovate on new products like mobile deep linking, whole page optimization and improved measurement solutions, we believe these investments will drive better returns on ad spend for our partners. As Bill mentioned, we remain focused on deepening engagement with our existing and episodic users, which should allow us to grow our revenue per user over time. From Q4 2019 to Q4 2022, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 30%, while our monthly active users grew at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. Our growth opportunities should continue to be robust as we improve frequency of visitation, make Pinterest more shoppable to satisfy intent to action, deliver more solutions for advertisers and improve the relevance of our advertising to match our users' commercial intent. During the quarter, 450 million global monthly active users came to Pinterest, growing 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. We believe that our investments in relevance and personalization are the primary drivers of our return to seasonal growth. In the US and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, back to year ago levels. As we've noted before, our mobile application users are our most monetizable users and account for over 80% of our total impressions and revenue. Global mobile application monthly active users accelerated to 14% growth, and US and Canada mobile app MAUs accelerated to 5% growth after returning to growth for the first time this year in Q3 of 2022. Furthermore, global and US and Canada sessions grew significantly faster than monthly active users and accelerated from the third quarter. In addition, we saw growth in many of our core verticals as well as some of our emerging verticals like travel, vehicles and men's fashion. Turning to our financial performance. Q4 global revenue of $877 million grew 6% on a constant currency basis or 4% on a reported basis. Strength came from large retailers looking to drive sales during the holiday season, and we had solid growth from our international markets when adjusting for foreign exchange headwinds. There was also resilience in our awareness objective or brand ad spend, as advertisers continue to lean into the brand safety and positivity on Pinterest. Furthermore, some emerging verticals, including automotive, travel and financial services, posted strong revenue growth. While we saw pockets of resilience from some CPG advertisers, many of our CPG partners and our US mid-market and SMB advertisers continue to face some challenges stemming from the current macro climate. In terms of revenue by region, US and Canada revenue was $722 million, an increase of 5%. Total revenue from Europe was $123 million, growing 5% on a constant currency basis but declining 7% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange headwinds. Total revenue from our Rest of World region was $32 million, growing 33% on a constant currency basis and 26% on a reported basis. Turning to our EBITDA and expense profile. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million in Q4 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22%. This EBITDA figure includes several actions we took in the fourth quarter that we believe will reduce our expense profile for 2023 and beyond. Most notably, this included a realignment of our resources against our shopping strategy as well as reductions to our recruiting staff and closures of some of our smaller and less utilized office spaces. Collectively, these actions accounted for about two percentage points of EBITDA margin. I'd also like to provide more color on how these actions impacted some of our expenses. Total operating expenses were $508 million, up 17% quarter-over-quarter. If you adjust for the costs associated with the actions I described during Q4, our operating expenses grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance. These costs were spread across sales and marketing and G&A. More specifically, our sales and marketing expenses grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. The actions I referenced accounted for approximately five points of that growth, while our brand marketing campaign that I've referenced on past calls drove the vast majority of the rest of the growth. G&A expenses grew 25% quarter-over-quarter. Over 80% of that growth was driven by the actions I previously mentioned, as well as increased taxes and bad debt expense. Excluding all of these items, our G&A would have grown 4% sequentially. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As we look ahead, while the macroeconomic environment remains volatile and we're experiencing softer advertiser demand, we want to share our best judgment around our guide based on the signals we have today. For Q1, we expect revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. Quarter-to-date, our revenue growth is trending nearly in line with our reported revenue growth from Q4. However, similar to last quarter, we believe the error bars are a bit wider given the volatility in the market. Our guide includes about one to two points of foreign exchange headwind, and we also expect headwinds to persist from our US small and medium business and mid-market advertisers as they continue to face outsized challenges in this macro environment. While we've made significant progress in opening up more monetizable supply and reducing cost per action, these advertisers remain price-sensitive. For the first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, we expect a sequential decline in the low double-digit percentage range. First, we're not planning to invest in a brand marketing campaign in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter. Second, the net impact of the actions we took in Q4 and to date in Q1 related to expense reductions are reflected in the guidance. While these actions resulted in additional costs within these quarters, we believe they will contribute to our full year goal of returning to margin expansion. As you think about our operating expense cadence through the year, you should expect a meaningful deceleration each quarter and year-over-year growth in OpEx, especially as we move into the second half of the year as we will be lapping the significant investment in hiring we made into the business in the first half of 2022. On monthly active users, as you know, we generally do not provide guidance. We are encouraged that our investments in relevance and personalization brought us back to top line MAU growth, and we're focusing on deepening engagement within our core and episodic users. As Bill mentioned earlier, we're focused on providing long-term shareholder value, including through our capital allocation strategy. Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. We plan to commence repurchasing shares this quarter, and we intend to complete the program over the following 12 months. We believe it's important to have equity as a portion of our overall compensation program as it fosters an ownership culture with our employees, and this share repurchase program will help offset the dilutive impact of this equity compensation. Our repurchase program is in addition to an operating -- operational approach to mitigate dilution that we implemented in the second quarter of last year called Net Settlement, under which we, as a company, hold back shares to cover the taxes on employees vested RSUs, where the company pays for the taxes from our own cash reserve on behalf of the employees. Net Settlement could amount to a use of cash of approximately $275 million in 2023, depending on a variety of factors, including the stock price and the number of grants that vest through the year. Finally, I want to thank our teams of interest, our advertising partners, and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. And first, Todd, congratulations on future endeavors. I'm sure we'll probably have one more earnings call together, but just wishing you best of luck in future endeavors. Maybe on the first question, obviously, visibility remains low in the overall advertising environment. Can you give us your perspective on how you're managing through that sort of low visibility that you're seeing right now versus managing towards building what you want to build on the advertising side for the long-term and how we should expect the interplay of those factors in the coming quarters? And then second, as we exit 2022, and you guys sprinkled a lot of this into your prepared remarks, but how should we think about what the top priorities are for investment into 2023 and how, again, that maybe plays back against sort of the broader growth environment that you're seeing? Thanks so much.\nBill Ready: Thanks Eric. So, if I step back and sort of address your questions on the broader landscape and sort of where we are in progressing along our objectives there, first, I'd say, while 4% to 6% revenue growth typically wouldn't be something to write home about, we're actually outperforming compared to a lot of our peers. And we believe we're gaining share, especially with our larger and most sophisticated advertisers, where we're gaining more share of wallet. So, as we talked about, we have huge growth potential in front of us, and I'll try to frame out that potential. So, when I came to Pinterest two quarters ago, analysts and investors had a few questions. Could we regain share with our core user base after the pandemic unwind? Could we compete in a world of more short-form video? And could we build a monetization engine at scale? After a little over six months, I'm more confident than ever that we can do all of the above, and we're focusing our investments in employing operational discipline across the organization to get there. So, on the first question, can we return to user growth? Yes. We've returned to year-over-year MAU growth. And better than that, we're seeing double-digit growth in our most monetizable and stickiest mobile app MAUs. And we're also seeing that our engagement overall is growing double-digit percentages. So, we feel really good about the growing sessions and the fact that sessions are growing even faster than users, and that growth is accelerating. In fact, in our 10-K, which will be filed today, you'll see that our weekly active to monthly active user ratio is at its highest level ever at 61%. That's clear evidence that we're deepening engagement as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters and finding really good success there. Second, we can compete in a world where our peers -- the second question was, can we compete in a world where our peers are all in on short-form video? And I think we're answering that question with a clear yes as well, but doing it on our own terms. Our supply of content is growing. Video content is up 30% quarter-on-quarter. We're finding more efficient ways to get engaging content on Pinterest, serve the needs of our Pinners from inspiration to action. And importantly, while we're seeing more than 10% of our engagement is on video, it's more than 30% of our revenue that is on short-form video. So when we think about monetizing that short-form video, which I think has been an open question broadly, we're seeing really good success in the monetization of short-form video, which I think is unique and stands out. And so further to that point, the question of can we build a monetization engine at scale, absolutely. I couldn't be more excited about the advancements we've made in our ad stack and how that's allowed us to grow monetizable supply north of 15%, higher than overall engagement gains because of tech innovation like whole page optimization, which opportunistically increases ad load when a consumer is in a shopping mode or has a commercial intent. We're building solutions to help advertisers measure results on our platform like our conversion API and our new clean room solution. And while we're early in the adoption curve on those measurement capabilities and those new tools for advertisers, we're seeing that our best share gains, our best growth is coming from the discerning advertisers that are implementing those tools and the more they see visibility into our performance. The more we see that, that performance is clear and I think that bodes well for our future as more and more of those advertisers adopt those tools from us. So while we remain in a demand-challenged environment, I think the improvements we've made to deliver advertiser value are paying off. I think that's why you see us growing faster than many in the peer set. And while demand doesn't flip overnight, we think the setup that we have of deepening engagement, the supply on our platform growing even faster than the deepening engagement with innovations like whole page optimization are making sure we have really great relevance of those ads and allowing us to serve more relevant ads in commercial context, that, coupled with the progress we're making on measurement tools and the performance we're seeing there early in that adoption curve with discerning advertisers, we think all that sets us up really well for the medium to long-term, even as we're fighting through a lot of choppiness in the near-term, just as everybody else is.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sheridan\nBill Ready: And then one final point. I think, Eric, you also asked about top priorities. I think I addressed many of these in the call, so I won't belabor those. But I think on each of these points, while we have really great progress, we continue to proceed forward on those. I talked about making sure that we're making our -- all of our core experience as shoppable as well as driving further improvements to engagement and our ad stack. We think we're early in those journeys. We're going to have really good proof points. Those continue to be our priorities. And then finally, the operational rigor, where we've implemented a program around operational rigor, we're seeing good results from that. And importantly, even as we're implementing more operational rigor, we're seeing really good product innovation. And so the comments I've made multiple times around constraints leading to creativity, we're seeing that in action. And we feel really good about the progress on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sheridan. Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey. Just following up on the prior question on priorities and investment levels. So Todd, if revenue -- I know we don't have a ton of visibility, but let's just say low single digits is what we see in the first half and then it improves to something higher than that in the second half of the year, what kind of margin expansion might we see based on the planned investment levels that you talked about for 2023? And then the second question, Bill, you guys have talked about using an ad partnership idea as a supplement to your direct ad sales, where you bring in demand from some of these retail media networks and DSPs and other third parties. So could you just talk a little bit more about timing and magnitude of something like this? It didn't come up on that prior checklist. So is that more of a 2024 event? And then how do you -- if you do implement that, balance the partnership idea with direct ad sales? Thanks a lot.\nBill Ready: Yes. Thanks a lot. I'll hit your second question first then give it to Todd to hit your first question. So we definitely think about sourcing ad demand as an opportunity for us. Our first priority is always going to be our direct sales and the partnerships that we're driving there. And we feel really good about the progress that our sales team is making on that and how we're winning with those advertisers that have implemented our latest tools and the most sophisticated and discerning advertisers seeing our performance be the strongest. We feel really good about that first-party selling motion. But we do believe there's an opportunity to augment our demand with third parties. And you mentioned one of those that we've done already around Retail Media Networks. We think there's a lot more opportunity in those. And we also think that leveraging third-party demand has been an underutilized lever here, particularly compared to other platforms. And so that is something that we will continue to explore. While no specific updates on specific deals or specific partners or those kinds of things, I do think that is something that we'll look to take more action on. We're already taking action on it with Retail Media Networks and something that we'll look to continue taking action on more in the near-term. It is not something that I'd put into 2024. It's something that we're actively exploring. And again, no specific updates or specific announcements on what we do there. But we are very much looking at that as a meaningful opportunity in the near-term versus something that would be relegated to the medium or long-term.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And Ross, on your margin question, not to be too basic about it, but in a world where we have a volatile demand picture and some uncertainty on the year, generally from a top line perspective, we know revenue needs to outgrow costs. We talked about meaningful margin expansion a few quarters ago, and that's something we're still committed to and understand the levers that are needed to get there. Ideally, we can grow as the demand environment hopefully normalizes given all the factors that Bill describes. Deepening engagement, that strategy is working. We've opened up more monetizable supply at lower prices. We've built tools, including whole page optimization and mobile deep linking to better utilize that monetizable supply. And our measurement tools are proving that those ads are working better and better. So I'm confident that we'll -- as the demand picture normalizes, we'll see some upside from a revenue perspective. But we also know that there's another part of this equation that's on the cost side. And from a gross margin perspective, you saw in this current quarter that our cost of revenue declined quarter-over-quarter after meaningful expansion through the year. That's a product of more discipline from an infrastructure standpoint and hope to continue to invest in further optimizations through the year, which creates a little bit more headroom for OpEx. And as Bill mentioned, we slowed hiring pretty significantly in the summer of last year. We took some actions in the fourth quarter. We've taken more actions already, and we continue to evaluate other levers, including things like our real estate portfolio, to make sure we're on track to deliver that margin expansion. If I'm in your shoes thinking about modeling how the year will unfold, you probably can sense from my guide that year-over-year OpEx growth for the first quarter is a huge step down from the year-over-year growth that we posted in the fourth quarter on OpEx. You'll see another meaningful step down and further step down as the year unfolds because we're lapping in each of the four quarters because we're lapping a lot of headcount-related investments that we made in the first half of last year. And then we're lapping a lot of our brand and marketing campaigns in the back half of the year, including some creator rewards programs, which we would dial back and are discretionary. When you think about that from a modeling perspective, that means that we would be able to post much, much, much reduced OpEx growth through the course of the year that should support even low levels of revenue growth, driving margin expansion. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sandler. The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, you've made a lot of progress around users and sessions and engagement. I was just wondering if you have any stats to share at all about clicks to advertisers, interaction with advertisers or anything on transaction? I know it's early, but just any way you can quantify sort of some of the early progress you're making on your users engaging more with your advertisers? And the second one, Bill, I guess, if you sort of look at your user behavior as well as the key merchants and inventory you're putting on the platform, what are sort of two or three of the most important verticals in e-commerce that you think are going to really catalyze the advertising growth to materially faster growth over the course of the year into next year? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Maybe on the first question, on the progress we're seeing there, I mentioned in my remarks, shopping ad is growing 50% year-on-year as well as not only solving for shopping, but giving easier conversions, easier ability for the user to connect with the place to buy through our mobile deep linking capabilities. And so I shared how significant the percentage of revenue from shopping apps is coming from mobile deep linking. I think that is an early indicator of just how much we can do not only to make more of our content shoppable, but also our ability to drive that full funnel engagement where we've historically been much stronger at the upper and mid-funnel. But at the lower end of that funnel, we're seeing that low-funnel conversion objective being about a third of our revenue overall in things like mobile deep linking, which we have not had that adopted across the board, but the early adopters of that have seen really strong performance. So, I mentioned that part of what gives me a lot of confidence in our future is much of our performance is coming from early adoption of new conversion tools like -- or new measurement tools like our conversion API and new capabilities like mobile deep linking that right now have been adopted by a smaller set of our larger, more sophisticated advertisers. As we move along that adoption curve, I think that bodes well for how we can compete more broadly, particularly on shopping-type actions, conversion objectives, and these lower-funnel objectives. So, those are really good early indicators that as we move on the adoption curve, I feel quite good about. You asked also about which categories we think of. Shopping is pretty broad based on our platform. There are some obvious ones that you would think about, women's fashion and apparel and those kinds of things that are definitely places where we have very large engagement, significant opportunity. We have other large moment engagement, things like weddings and home redesigns and these kinds of things that are meaningful user behaviors as well. We have some really interesting emerging behavior also. Todd mentioned growth in things like autos and men's fashion, Gen Z being our fastest-growing demographic. So we feel like shopping is a broad-based opportunity. While there are some categories that we will lean into first, we see it as quite broad-based, probably more broad-based than many may appreciate on our platform. Todd, I don't know anything you would add to that?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. I mean, I think there's a different way of cutting it too. I think everything Bill said is absolutely right. The other way of thinking about it is just in terms of these joint business partnerships that we signed. So if you cut the market by large versus small as opposed to category of retail or category of shopping marketplace, we've seen -- I think I talked about it a couple of quarters ago that we saw 25% growth in joint business partnerships first half of 2022 versus first half of 2021. And we talked at the time about how that was a source of confidence in that the ad stack and the experience, the full funnel model here was working for the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. We ended the year up 27% year-over-year on joint business partnerships. So we saw that tick up. And so from the standpoint of what Bill was describing, some of the largest, most sophisticated specialty e-commerce and specialty retailers are seeing great success on the platform. And that expands from brand through consideration, through purchase behavior. So really high confidence in success being driven by some of these larger players through the cycle where there's been a lot more resilience.\nBrian Nowak: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Nowak. The next question is from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please proceed.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, how should we think about your comments around time spent in deepening engagement. I mean, is there -- I know you're only reporting sort of -- you sort of give us overview metrics, like you haven't gotten to DAU yet. But it does feel like -- I mean, is that the metric that you're sort of solving for is to get people to be using Pinterest on a daily basis? And like you made these comments about sort of Gen Z and video. And I'm curious if a user touches video Pin, do they end up spending a lot more time on Pinterest, if they create X number of boards? Like I guess what I'm trying to understand is what the unlock it gets someone to spend meaningfully more time? Is it engaging with video, creating a board? Like what have you learned since you sort of took over Pinterest? Because I guess we're all trying to understand, like what are you solving for that ends up leading to a far more engaged user who comes back -- I guess I'm sort of curious, like is the goal daily, every few hours, every week? Like what are you trying to solve for? I know that's a long-winded question.\nBill Ready: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we think there's a huge opportunity in moving Pinterest users from episodic usage to more frequent usage. And certainly, when you think about something like shopping as a behavior, those become the kinds of use cases that can be more daily-type use cases versus monthly or quarterly use cases. And so a lot of the progress you've seen from us over the last multiple quarters has been around using good AI and machine learning to get better recommendations, better personalization and using that to provide better recommendations to our users. And we think there's a lot more opportunity to use those nudges to the user to help them find new use cases on Pinterest. And we've got some really good early evidence of that. Again, it's our personalization and the AI capabilities behind that are a lot of what's been driving our improvements in engagement. But yes, we want to move people from episodic use cases to things that are weekly and daily use cases. And again, we feel like we're well on our way there. We are by no means done. But to see things like engagement sessions and multiple measures of engagement at 10%-plus, we feel really great about that. I think the other thing that I mentioned this before, underscore gains, I think it's a big unlock, which is the work that we've done around whole page optimization and demonstrating that ads can be valuable content to the user. If you think about the levers of growth in the businesses, yes, we're going to grow MAUs. But more than that, there's so much what I would call leaked engagement from the platform, where somebody couldn't satisfy their intent here and monetization would occur someplace else. So as we get more and more ability to take action on the things that people are already finding here that's plugging a lot of leaked engagement, a lot of leaked monetization, but then also give the use of reasons to want to come back to us more and then our ability to monetize that as we've made progress with whole page optimization that we launched in Q4. What that's really showing is that in those commercial context, we can actually serve a lot more ads, a lot more relevant ads in ways that are good for the user, helps them satisfy their intent and very highly monetizable for us. So I think that makes me feel really good about our long-term prospects is that we have multiple levers of growth there, like yes, getting from episodic to more monthly, weekly, daily usage, but then within that, playing a lot of that leaked engagement, playing a lot of that leaked monetization and actually being able to bring much more ad load and much more relevant ad load to the platform than what we've had historically. So that's how I think about the way that unfolds over time. And while we've had good early indicators, we are at the very beginning of the potential from that. And I think there's -- if you thought about our monetization on these commercial interactions, I think we're at a fraction of the ad load that you would see in a lot of other places that have these highly commercial intents. So there's a lot more we can do there. We've set the foundation for how we can dynamically take that ad load up in a way that's good for the user, good for the advertiser. That's a foundation that will allow us to grow quite a bit more. And actually tying back into the questions around third-party demand, one of the things you need to do first before you bring in more demand is make sure you've got the supply to be able to serve that demand. With our supply growing -- engagement is growing faster than users, supply is growing faster than engagement, we now very clearly have the supply and the ability to go serve that ad content in a way that's relevant and helpful to the user that we think lets us unlock a lot more potential in the ad platform going forward.\nTodd Morgenfeld: The only other thing I would add on that, so we -- I've had an aspiration -- over the last few years, you may think back to the IPO, we talked about bringing people back to Pinterest for more things in their life, because we know that that drives stickiness with our user base. We invested a lot in personalization and relevance last year because we wanted to address deepening engagement. You've seen the results of that this quarter with growing MAUs, our mobile application user growth at 14% globally, up 5% year-over-year in the US and Canada. Bill referenced the weekly to monthly active user ratio at an all-time high, sessions growing faster than all of the above. So, the deepening engagement story is working because we were investing heavily in personalization and relevance. You saw that in the financials because our gross margin and cost of revenue climbed last year. Why did it climb? It climbed because we built 100 times the size of our machine learning models last year to power that experience based on unique first-party signal. We're now seeing the results of that in the engagement figures, and that gives us a different foundation on which to deliver new use cases to our users going forward. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Greenfield. The next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks and good afternoon everybody. Maybe first, just as a follow-up on the comments around the episodic users. I know this is in early stages, but what's sort of the time frame you'd expect where we could see an acceleration in MAUs above sort of the seasonal trends? I think, Todd, you talked about that you saw in Q4. And then secondly, regarding features like Watch and Pinterest TV, which you're gaining more visibility on the app, curious how these are impacting monetization or ARPU? Bill, I think you mentioned a stat around video and the portion of monetization growth. So, I didn't quite catch exactly what that was, though. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Great. Thanks Colin. So, on the shift from episodic to more frequent usage, I think you're seeing some of that reflected already. The progress we've made, as Todd and I both mentioned, around greater personalization, giving you just more reasons to come back, I think that's part of why we're seeing engagement grow much faster than MAUs overall. You asked about a timeframe for MAUs to move beyond seasonal. Again, I would point to focus more towards the overall engagement and the revenue per user rather than MAUs. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have hundreds of millions of users that come to Pinterest that are not in our MAU count that come to us on an episodic basis. And so we're much more focused on how do we drive deeper engagement with the users we have. You can imagine we have a very good view as to where those other users are, which ones monetize well. If we wanted to chase MAUs as a vanity metric, we will chase it as a vanity metric, but they may not be the users that would monetize the best or where we need to go defend our platform the most. And so we're much more focused on deepening the engagement with the users that are in places where we know we need to compete most and where we also have the best monetization opportunity. And so I'd point your attention more towards the accelerating engagement and the accelerating revenue per user on where we go there. And on video, and especially the monetization around video, I think this is a place -- it's one of the most exciting things that I've seen in our work here is that -- prior to my joining Pinterest, a -- I think a commonly held viewpoint on short-form video that I held as well was that the engagement is fantastic. But do the unit economics actually work? Can you make money off of it in a way that more than outstrips the significant increase in the expense was very much an open question? And to say that we have more than 10% of our engagement on video, but more than 30% of our revenue on video, I think, just puts us in a very different place than many others in terms of having found that right balance of how to monetize short-form video and make sure that's driving both engagement and monetization. And we think there's a lot more we can do there. Because we're a lean-forward platform rather than an entertainment platform, the lean-forward nature of our platform, we think we have a lot of license from users to do much more with short-form video. So a question I've been posing to the team is in the same way that images existed on the web before Pinterest, that Pinterest brought new utilities to those images, short-form video has existed independent of Pinterest. But we believe we can bring utility to those short-form videos in ways that others may not, and others may not have user license to do because they have the user in a lean-back entertainment mode. We have the user in a lean-forward intent mode, where we think shoppable content and these kinds of things can be much more well received by our users. And so that's a big part of what comes next for us is that we're looking at how we make video shoppable. We have a really great strength in our team on computer vision. There's lots of talk about AI and how it's advancing. One of the most exciting areas of the next generation of AI is around computer vision. And that's a core competency for us. And so we're using computer vision to make video more shoppable, and some really good early results there. So our new core computer vision model that has over 1 billion-plus parameters has led to an 8% increase in visual search shopping relevance. So these are the kinds of things that we think we can do -- that we think we're already doing quite well in the balance of how to benefit from short-form video, driving gate from that but monetize it well, and we think there's a lot more to come there. I hope that helps.\nColin Sebastian: That does. Thanks, Todd.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Colin.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sebastian. The next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Hey, thanks. When you talk about sessions growing faster than users, can you provide a little bit more color on that? Is that users are spending more sessions, more time within the current categories that they're interested in? Or is there any -- is there evidence that they're starting to look across different categories? That's one question. Then the second one, just in terms of -- you talked about meaningful margin expansion in 2023. I know in the past, you talked about non-GAAP OpEx growth in fiscal 2023 would be slower than in 2022. So I'm sort of hoping you could qualitatively or quantitatively talk a little bit more about what fiscal 2023 looks like. And does meaningful margin expansion mean a couple of hundred bps of EBITDA margin expansion? Anything else there would be really helpful. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Mark. So a couple of things. We -- when we say sessions, we're looking at what we consider to be a meaningful engagement with the platform. So you're not just coming here and bouncing, but you're on for more than a minute in general. And so those are quality engagements largely from people on mobile application \u2013 mobile app and even more impressions and revenue opportunity from those sessions than what we have seen from kind of our web-based users historically. We've seen good engagement across a number of verticals, some of our core verticals. But we've also seen, as I mentioned in my script, that there are some areas where we're seeing some cross-fertilization into some new areas. So I'm highly encouraged. In fact, one of the things I called out was men's fashion, which may come as a surprise to some on the call. We're actually seeing some of that use case diversification into things like automotive, travel, which is something we started calling out as people went out and about post-COVID. And so to answer your question, yes, we're seeing some use case diversification not only across our core verticals, but also into some emerging ones, which gives us a lot of confidence in the next journey toward use case diversification. On the non-GAAP margin, we had said a couple of quarters ago that we thought that could be around a couple of hundred basis points of margin improvement, and we're committed to delivering that. It's going to take us stepping down from where we were in the fourth quarter meaningfully in terms of year-over-year growth. I think the year-over-year OpEx growth implied by my low double-digit sequential decline is probably in the low 20s on a year-over-year basis versus 40% growth from Q4. You should expect another big step down in the second quarter, another big step down in the third quarter and another big step down in the fourth quarter. So when you do the math on what that implies for the year, it's not just a little deceleration from this year. It's a complete reset.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Todd, and wishing you all the best going forwards.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Mahaney. The next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thank you. Two questions, if I can. First, just going back to that earlier comments around, partnerships around monetization with the likes of Retail Media Networks or other DSPs. How much do you guys see that as an opportunity around like billing in ad coverage on certain categories, helping monetize new geographies or even just on a pure pricing? Like do you think you benchmark so low that using other platforms can drive up pricing? Anything you can share there would be helpful. And then going back to the notion that you monetize, I think you said video is 30% of monetization, 10% of engagement. Appreciate some of the color you've already shared. But is that SKU brand? Or is that also kind of match your overall DR mix? Are you selling those ads or media partners, in some cases, selling ads on that content? Like -- or is it just a function of the ad creative working where you just get a higher click-through rate on those ads? Like anything you can share there to help us understand that better would be great. Thanks.\nBill Ready: All right. Thanks for the question. So on partnerships, I mean, I think each of the dimensions you mentioned are part of the opportunity. If you use the platform, you can see that there's an opportunity for us to drive increased ad relevance. I feel really great about the progress our sales team has made. But as a smaller platform, even really large, really dense auctions will augment their demand with third-party sources. And so as a smaller player, as great as our sales team has done in driving first-party ad demand, which we are absolutely committed to continuing to do, it's a real asset. We're going to continue to invest in that. If even the largest auctions benefit from augmenting demand with third-party sources, certainly, we can as well. And in doing that, that should give you greater relevance. I think I made the comment earlier around the foundation we've laid with whole page optimization. That sets us up to think about in an integrated way how we bring ads to the user in a way where those ads are relevant content, which we think is -- has a two-fold benefit. One is drive engagement when it truly is -- particularly in a commercial context where that ad could be relevant content for the user. But then secondarily, it lets us serve more ads and take our ad load up from where it's been. And our ad loads has previously been a fraction of what you would expect in other places with the kind of commercial intent that we have. So, ad coverage, increasing relevancy, ad load, these are things that will naturally improve with us over time. But as we think about the benefits potentially of augment third-party sources, retail gate networks or otherwise, we think that's an opportunity, geographies can be an opportunity. And then your final point on pricing, I think -- one of the things that I think is hard to overstate and the progress we've made here is that the whole industry is going through a rewiring on ad measurement and moving from cookies to privacy safe ad measurement solutions. So, while the whole industry is going through that rewiring, we are -- we've provided our conversion API. We've launched our cleanroom efforts. And our early indications there are really positive, but we are very early on that adoption curve. And as we think we move along that adoption curve, we think we actually are performing far better than many advertisers realize far better than what they've been able to measure. And so bringing that greater measurement is a real opportunity. Those are things that we're absolutely going to do first party, but those are also things that as we think about the potential for partnership across the industry, there's multiple different ways that, that can play out. And you've seen us talk about some of those already, like what we did in our cleanroom efforts with LiveRamp and Albertsons. And we think we'll have more of those kinds of opportunities going forward that will help with measurement, and therefore, also help with pricing as advertisers have better visibility into the value we're creating for them. And then on your other question on video, we're kind of not breaking it down quite to the level of specificity that you're asking for. But we're seeing good broad-based engagement on video. I'll give it to Todd, if there's anything more you want to share about video generally.\nTodd Morgenfeld: No, I would say we -- in general that it tends to be more of an awareness opportunity. That's kind of where it started. We have built performance video and have seen decent returns there. But I think the opportunity going forward is, as Bill has talked about before, building a real full funnel video advertising experience, it takes people through conversion. I think there's a unique opportunity given the shopping mindset where more than half of the people come to Pinterest to shop. Video advertising can take you through the full funnel in a super compelling way. So, I'm excited about the opportunity there.\nBill Ready: Okay. Thank you. Operator--\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Walmsley.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, I think we're out of time now.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your time -- your line.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks Bill. I appreciate the kind words and the partnership. I also want to thank the entire Pinterest team and the Board for the opportunity to contribute over the past six years. I look forward to watching the company continue to innovate, execute, and grow. I'll now discuss our results. In my remarks today, I'll talk about our Q4 financial performance and our preliminary Q1 outlook. All financial metrics except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified. And as a reminder, all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In 2022, we made platform-wide innovations that resulted in improving the user experience through more personalized content, showing more relevant products that fit users' tastes and preferences, and delivering increased value to advertisers through ad stack innovation, new measurement solutions, and more seamless handoffs to merchant sites. Even though softening demand lowered ad pricing across the industry, including on our platform, we grew revenue in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we expect our 2022 investments in our ad stack to help deliver competitive cost per action as the demand environment normalizes in the future. As we continue to innovate on new products like mobile deep linking, whole page optimization and improved measurement solutions, we believe these investments will drive better returns on ad spend for our partners. As Bill mentioned, we remain focused on deepening engagement with our existing and episodic users, which should allow us to grow our revenue per user over time. From Q4 2019 to Q4 2022, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 30%, while our monthly active users grew at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. Our growth opportunities should continue to be robust as we improve frequency of visitation, make Pinterest more shoppable to satisfy intent to action, deliver more solutions for advertisers and improve the relevance of our advertising to match our users' commercial intent. During the quarter, 450 million global monthly active users came to Pinterest, growing 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. We believe that our investments in relevance and personalization are the primary drivers of our return to seasonal growth. In the US and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, back to year ago levels. As we've noted before, our mobile application users are our most monetizable users and account for over 80% of our total impressions and revenue. Global mobile application monthly active users accelerated to 14% growth, and US and Canada mobile app MAUs accelerated to 5% growth after returning to growth for the first time this year in Q3 of 2022. Furthermore, global and US and Canada sessions grew significantly faster than monthly active users and accelerated from the third quarter. In addition, we saw growth in many of our core verticals as well as some of our emerging verticals like travel, vehicles and men's fashion. Turning to our financial performance. Q4 global revenue of $877 million grew 6% on a constant currency basis or 4% on a reported basis. Strength came from large retailers looking to drive sales during the holiday season, and we had solid growth from our international markets when adjusting for foreign exchange headwinds. There was also resilience in our awareness objective or brand ad spend, as advertisers continue to lean into the brand safety and positivity on Pinterest. Furthermore, some emerging verticals, including automotive, travel and financial services, posted strong revenue growth. While we saw pockets of resilience from some CPG advertisers, many of our CPG partners and our US mid-market and SMB advertisers continue to face some challenges stemming from the current macro climate. In terms of revenue by region, US and Canada revenue was $722 million, an increase of 5%. Total revenue from Europe was $123 million, growing 5% on a constant currency basis but declining 7% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange headwinds. Total revenue from our Rest of World region was $32 million, growing 33% on a constant currency basis and 26% on a reported basis. Turning to our EBITDA and expense profile. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million in Q4 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22%. This EBITDA figure includes several actions we took in the fourth quarter that we believe will reduce our expense profile for 2023 and beyond. Most notably, this included a realignment of our resources against our shopping strategy as well as reductions to our recruiting staff and closures of some of our smaller and less utilized office spaces. Collectively, these actions accounted for about two percentage points of EBITDA margin. I'd also like to provide more color on how these actions impacted some of our expenses. Total operating expenses were $508 million, up 17% quarter-over-quarter. If you adjust for the costs associated with the actions I described during Q4, our operating expenses grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance. These costs were spread across sales and marketing and G&A. More specifically, our sales and marketing expenses grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. The actions I referenced accounted for approximately five points of that growth, while our brand marketing campaign that I've referenced on past calls drove the vast majority of the rest of the growth. G&A expenses grew 25% quarter-over-quarter. Over 80% of that growth was driven by the actions I previously mentioned, as well as increased taxes and bad debt expense. Excluding all of these items, our G&A would have grown 4% sequentially. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As we look ahead, while the macroeconomic environment remains volatile and we're experiencing softer advertiser demand, we want to share our best judgment around our guide based on the signals we have today. For Q1, we expect revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. Quarter-to-date, our revenue growth is trending nearly in line with our reported revenue growth from Q4. However, similar to last quarter, we believe the error bars are a bit wider given the volatility in the market. Our guide includes about one to two points of foreign exchange headwind, and we also expect headwinds to persist from our US small and medium business and mid-market advertisers as they continue to face outsized challenges in this macro environment. While we've made significant progress in opening up more monetizable supply and reducing cost per action, these advertisers remain price-sensitive. For the first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, we expect a sequential decline in the low double-digit percentage range. First, we're not planning to invest in a brand marketing campaign in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter. Second, the net impact of the actions we took in Q4 and to date in Q1 related to expense reductions are reflected in the guidance. While these actions resulted in additional costs within these quarters, we believe they will contribute to our full year goal of returning to margin expansion. As you think about our operating expense cadence through the year, you should expect a meaningful deceleration each quarter and year-over-year growth in OpEx, especially as we move into the second half of the year as we will be lapping the significant investment in hiring we made into the business in the first half of 2022. On monthly active users, as you know, we generally do not provide guidance. We are encouraged that our investments in relevance and personalization brought us back to top line MAU growth, and we're focusing on deepening engagement within our core and episodic users. As Bill mentioned earlier, we're focused on providing long-term shareholder value, including through our capital allocation strategy. Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. We plan to commence repurchasing shares this quarter, and we intend to complete the program over the following 12 months. We believe it's important to have equity as a portion of our overall compensation program as it fosters an ownership culture with our employees, and this share repurchase program will help offset the dilutive impact of this equity compensation. Our repurchase program is in addition to an operating -- operational approach to mitigate dilution that we implemented in the second quarter of last year called Net Settlement, under which we, as a company, hold back shares to cover the taxes on employees vested RSUs, where the company pays for the taxes from our own cash reserve on behalf of the employees. Net Settlement could amount to a use of cash of approximately $275 million in 2023, depending on a variety of factors, including the stock price and the number of grants that vest through the year. Finally, I want to thank our teams of interest, our advertising partners, and all of the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. And Ross, on your margin question, not to be too basic about it, but in a world where we have a volatile demand picture and some uncertainty on the year, generally from a top line perspective, we know revenue needs to outgrow costs. We talked about meaningful margin expansion a few quarters ago, and that's something we're still committed to and understand the levers that are needed to get there. Ideally, we can grow as the demand environment hopefully normalizes given all the factors that Bill describes. Deepening engagement, that strategy is working. We've opened up more monetizable supply at lower prices. We've built tools, including whole page optimization and mobile deep linking to better utilize that monetizable supply. And our measurement tools are proving that those ads are working better and better. So I'm confident that we'll -- as the demand picture normalizes, we'll see some upside from a revenue perspective. But we also know that there's another part of this equation that's on the cost side. And from a gross margin perspective, you saw in this current quarter that our cost of revenue declined quarter-over-quarter after meaningful expansion through the year. That's a product of more discipline from an infrastructure standpoint and hope to continue to invest in further optimizations through the year, which creates a little bit more headroom for OpEx. And as Bill mentioned, we slowed hiring pretty significantly in the summer of last year. We took some actions in the fourth quarter. We've taken more actions already, and we continue to evaluate other levers, including things like our real estate portfolio, to make sure we're on track to deliver that margin expansion. If I'm in your shoes thinking about modeling how the year will unfold, you probably can sense from my guide that year-over-year OpEx growth for the first quarter is a huge step down from the year-over-year growth that we posted in the fourth quarter on OpEx. You'll see another meaningful step down and further step down as the year unfolds because we're lapping in each of the four quarters because we're lapping a lot of headcount-related investments that we made in the first half of last year. And then we're lapping a lot of our brand and marketing campaigns in the back half of the year, including some creator rewards programs, which we would dial back and are discretionary. When you think about that from a modeling perspective, that means that we would be able to post much, much, much reduced OpEx growth through the course of the year that should support even low levels of revenue growth, driving margin expansion. Operator, next question. Yes. I mean, I think there's a different way of cutting it too. I think everything Bill said is absolutely right. The other way of thinking about it is just in terms of these joint business partnerships that we signed. So if you cut the market by large versus small as opposed to category of retail or category of shopping marketplace, we've seen -- I think I talked about it a couple of quarters ago that we saw 25% growth in joint business partnerships first half of 2022 versus first half of 2021. And we talked at the time about how that was a source of confidence in that the ad stack and the experience, the full funnel model here was working for the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. We ended the year up 27% year-over-year on joint business partnerships. So we saw that tick up. And so from the standpoint of what Bill was describing, some of the largest, most sophisticated specialty e-commerce and specialty retailers are seeing great success on the platform. And that expands from brand through consideration, through purchase behavior. So really high confidence in success being driven by some of these larger players through the cycle where there's been a lot more resilience. The only other thing I would add on that, so we -- I've had an aspiration -- over the last few years, you may think back to the IPO, we talked about bringing people back to Pinterest for more things in their life, because we know that that drives stickiness with our user base. We invested a lot in personalization and relevance last year because we wanted to address deepening engagement. You've seen the results of that this quarter with growing MAUs, our mobile application user growth at 14% globally, up 5% year-over-year in the US and Canada. Bill referenced the weekly to monthly active user ratio at an all-time high, sessions growing faster than all of the above. So, the deepening engagement story is working because we were investing heavily in personalization and relevance. You saw that in the financials because our gross margin and cost of revenue climbed last year. Why did it climb? It climbed because we built 100 times the size of our machine learning models last year to power that experience based on unique first-party signal. We're now seeing the results of that in the engagement figures, and that gives us a different foundation on which to deliver new use cases to our users going forward. Operator, next question. Thanks, Colin. Thanks, Mark. So a couple of things. We -- when we say sessions, we're looking at what we consider to be a meaningful engagement with the platform. So you're not just coming here and bouncing, but you're on for more than a minute in general. And so those are quality engagements largely from people on mobile application \u2013 mobile app and even more impressions and revenue opportunity from those sessions than what we have seen from kind of our web-based users historically. We've seen good engagement across a number of verticals, some of our core verticals. But we've also seen, as I mentioned in my script, that there are some areas where we're seeing some cross-fertilization into some new areas. So I'm highly encouraged. In fact, one of the things I called out was men's fashion, which may come as a surprise to some on the call.

And so to answer your question, yes, we're seeing some use case diversification not only across our core verticals, but also into some emerging ones, which gives us a lot of confidence in the next journey toward use case diversification. On the non-GAAP margin, we had said a couple of quarters ago that we thought that could be around a couple of hundred basis points of margin improvement, and we're committed to delivering that. It's going to take us stepping down from where we were in the fourth quarter meaningfully in terms of year-over-year growth. I think the year-over-year OpEx growth implied by my low double-digit sequential decline is probably in the low 20s on a year-over-year basis versus 40% growth from Q4. You should expect another big step down in the second quarter, another big step down in the third quarter and another big step down in the fourth quarter. So when you do the math on what that implies for the year, it's not just a little deceleration from this year. It's a complete reset. Thank you. No, I would say we -- in general that it tends to be more of an awareness opportunity. That's kind of where it started. We have built performance video and have seen decent returns there.

I think there's a unique opportunity given the shopping mindset where more than half of the people come to Pinterest to shop. Video advertising can take you through the full funnel in a super compelling way. So, I'm excited about the opportunity there."

            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thanks Neil. Hi everyone and thank you for joining our Q4 earnings call. I'm proud of our team's focus and execution over the past year and in particular Q4. We reinvested in our core product experience that led to deepening engagement and a return to user growth. We built and shipped new ad tech and measurement solutions that resulted in improved returns for our advertisers. And we're just getting started. I have strong conviction that we will continue to innovate and deliver value to our users and business partners. We grew global MAUs in Q4 to 450 million, up both sequentially and year-over-year. Our global mobile app users which account for over 80% of our impressions and revenue grew 14% and our US and Canada mobile app users grew 5%, accelerating from last quarter. More importantly, sessions continue to grow significantly faster than users, demonstrating deepening engagement per user as we focus on driving greater per user monetization. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $877 million growing 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis, roughly in line with our mid-single-digit guidance range. Strength came from large US retail advertisers and international markets, excluding the impact of FX as these advertisers leaned into our full funnel platform during the holiday season. However, this strength was partially offset by CPG advertisers, as well as small and mid-market advertisers in the US who faced headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. For the full year we generated revenue of $2.8 billion, growing 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased with our results this quarter despite headwinds from the softening ad market, which Todd will speak to later. We remain confident in our long-term strategy in our ability to execute and drive value for users and advertisers. We're also increasing operational rigor and have taken actions to control costs in Q4. For example, we significantly slowed the pace of hiring such that our headcount was flat quarter-over-quarter. We reduced our infrastructure spend, which declined sequentially, despite strong engagement volume increases, and we closed some of our smaller offices for future cost savings. These actions put us on the path to meaningful EBITDA margin expansion in 2023 and demonstrate our focus on generating strong cash flow. As we build upon the solid foundation we set in 2022, we're laser focused on our four strategic priorities: one, growing monetization and engagement per user; two, integrating shopping into the core of the product experience; three, improving operational rigor and therefore, margin expansion; and four, strengthening our leadership as a positive and brand-safe platform. First, as I mentioned last quarter, we're focused on growing monetization per user. Given the users come to our platform with intent to make, do or shop, we are well positioned to achieve this by deepening user engagement, driving more intent to action and helping advertisers better monetize our supply. On deepening user engagement, we believe that we have a large opportunity to grow the frequency of engagement from episodic users. On top of our 450 million MAUs, hundreds of millions of logged in users come to Pinterest episodically. In 2023, we're pursuing more ways to bring these users back more often and to find the next use case by leveraging our machine learning models and building new experiences for them. We're also continuing the work, we began last year to serve more personalized, relevant and ultimately more engaging content. This effort has already yielded results, including our return to MAU growth and double-digit growth in mobile app users. However, we have more opportunity to leverage the unique first-party signal on our platform. Our users save and organize content to boards and active human curation at scale that is unique to Pinterest. This gives us insights into emerging trends and product associations as well as the ability to assist users when they have intent but have not yet decided what to buy. We're actively working to refresh the Pinterest board experience to make it easier for users to organize their interest, which should yield more and higher-quality signals. This, in turn, enables us to deliver increasingly relevant and timely content recommendations. I'm particularly excited about the work we've done to bring new and emerging demographics onto the platform. In Q4, Gen Z was once again our fastest-growing cohort, growing double digits and accelerating from Q3. We're building an experience that resonates with this audience on Pinterest, specifically around video. In fact, nearly half of all new videos pinned in Q4 were from Gen Z users. And in Q4, Gen Z sessions grew much faster than sessions from our other demographics. As I discussed last quarter, video also drives deeper engagement. We remain focused on growing our supply of videos from multiple sources, including creators, brands and publishers. Last quarter, we grew our supply of video content 30% quarter-over-quarter. And we recently announced a deal with Conde\u0301 Nast Entertainment to create high-quality video content aligned with Pinterest's key seasonal and cultural moments like fashion months, wedding season, summer and back-to-school. We believe high-quality and inspiring content will further deepen engagement, especially for Gen Z. Monetization per user should also be driven by our ads initiatives. Pinterest is unique because users come to our platform with intent, and we are one of the few places where people can go from seeking inspiration to fulfilling that intent through action. And we've built a full ad solution that helps advertisers meet users in their journey across the funnel from top to middle to bottom. In fact, our revenue is roughly split across the funnel with one-third brand, one-third consideration and one-third conversion. We've seen advertisers who take a full funnel approach see more success than those who are only active on one campaign objective. In 2022, advertisers adopting a multi-objective media strategy saw up to a 50% improvement in sales lift compared to those who use one objective based on our conversion [loss] (ph) study. I believe ads when relevant and personalized can be highly valuable content for users, fostering authentic interactions between brands and consumers. In Q4, we launched ad load management with whole page optimization, which flexes ad load opportunistically in context where ads are most well-suited for the user. In our initial testing, this drove double-digit improvements in ad relevance on search, while simultaneously reducing CPAs for advertisers. We expect the whole page optimization will enable us to continue to improve the efficiency with which we monetize our platform over time. In addition, we continue to improve conversion visibility through our measurement solutions in a privacy centric way to demonstrate the value that Pinterest brings to advertisers. For example, in Q4, we launched our conversion API, and we recently integrated this API with Shopify so that merchants can use our conversion measurement tool. Based on our tests, for advertisers using our conversion API with the Pinterest tag, we found an average of 28% lift in the attributed checkout conversions and 14% improvement in the checkout CPA metric. At CES this January, we announced our new privacy safe clean room solution with LiveRamp and Albertsons. Pinterest's integration with LiveRamp provides a protected third-party space where brands can join the first-party data and Pinterest platform data in a secure, privacy safe environment. Our second strategic goal for 2023 is to lean into the high intent that users express on Pinterest by integrating shopping into the core of the product experience. Based on surveys of our users, over 50% say they view Pinterest as a place to shop. Yet we haven't made it easy for them to shop historically as shoppable content was not integrated into core experiences. In our endeavor to make Pinterest the home of taste based shopping, we're integrating shopping across our most traffic surfaces, including home feed, search and related pins to show users products most relevant to them. Over the long-term, we also want to make every pin shoppable. To that end, we're making video content on Pinterest more actionable using the same playbook we applied to static images. Over the course of this year, we will be deploying our computer vision technology across our video corpus to find products and videos and make them shoppable. To make Pinterest more shoppable, we're creating a more seamless handoff by taking the user directly to the product detail page on the merchant's app. To this effort, we continue to deploy our mobile deep linking format, or MDL, on shopping ads. During the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, MDL accounted for 40% of our shopping ads revenue, which grew 50% in Q4. People are shopping on Pinterest, and we are helping merchants find end-market consumers. Third, we're driving operational rigor and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders. While 2022 started off as an investment year, we took steps to cut down on costs in this challenging macroeconomic environment starting in early Q3, and we are continuing to find ways to reduce our expenses so that we can meaningfully expand EBITDA margins. As I've said before, I'm a strong believer that constraints breed creativity, and I believe our teams will deliver more compelling products and experiences that set us up for sustainable growth long-term. Furthermore, Todd and I have been evaluating our broad capital allocation strategy, including investing in the business, maintaining flexibility for strategic acquisitions and options for returning capital to shareholders. Given the significant cash balance at Pinterest today, combined with our robust ongoing operating cash flow generation, we're planning to execute a stock buyback program of up to $500 million, which we plan to commence this quarter to help mitigate dilution from stock-based compensation. Todd will go into more details on our buyback program. Finally, one of the biggest differentiators of Pinterest is that we are an inspirational platform and we're intentionally tuning our business to be a positive place on the Internet. Pinterest's mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. And I believe in an online environment that is increasingly full of toxicity, this is more important than ever. Not only does it help our users, but also our advertisers as they look for more brand-safe environments to attract customers. From a user perspective, we've long been investing in being a more positive platform from products like inclusive search to important business decisions like banning political ads because we want our users to be in a positive space for inspiration and action. Users are noticing this investment. We have research confirming the positivity of our platform and emotional benefit to our users that we're planning to release in the coming weeks. We're seeing this sentiment come through with our advertisers as well. Some of our latest research also shows that ads that appear in a more positive environment drive more purchases at every stage of the funnel. We believe that positivity makes people more open to brands, more likely to remember them, and more driven to purchase. As I mentioned in our last call, I value the communication, input, and feedback with the investor and analyst communities. As part of that, we plan to host an Investor Day later this year, and we'll update you in the future on timing and additional details. Finally, as you may have seen in our press release today, Todd Morgenfeld, our CFO and Head of Business Operations, will transition from the company to pursue new career opportunities on July 1st. Todd has been instrumental to Pinterest's growth over the last six-plus years and is committed to ensuring a smooth transition, while we search for a new CFO. I'd like to take a moment to recognize Todd for his dedication to our employees, our Pinners, advertisers, and our shareholders. Todd has made significant contributions to our business over the last six-plus years, including leading the company's IPO process, helping the company navigate the pandemic, advancing our revenue functions, maturing our business operations, and partnering with me when I joined the company last year. So, Todd, we thank you for your partnership and leadership. Everyone at Pinterest will be cheering for you in your future endeavors, and I intend to be cheering the loudest. Thanks Eric. So, if I step back and sort of address your questions on the broader landscape and sort of where we are in progressing along our objectives there, first, I'd say, while 4% to 6% revenue growth typically wouldn't be something to write home about, we're actually outperforming compared to a lot of our peers. And we believe we're gaining share, especially with our larger and most sophisticated advertisers, where we're gaining more share of wallet. So, as we talked about, we have huge growth potential in front of us, and I'll try to frame out that potential. So, when I came to Pinterest two quarters ago, analysts and investors had a few questions. Could we regain share with our core user base after the pandemic unwind? Could we compete in a world of more short-form video? And could we build a monetization engine at scale? After a little over six months, I'm more confident than ever that we can do all of the above, and we're focusing our investments in employing operational discipline across the organization to get there. So, on the first question, can we return to user growth? Yes. We've returned to year-over-year MAU growth. And better than that, we're seeing double-digit growth in our most monetizable and stickiest mobile app MAUs. And we're also seeing that our engagement overall is growing double-digit percentages. So, we feel really good about the growing sessions and the fact that sessions are growing even faster than users, and that growth is accelerating. In fact, in our 10-K, which will be filed today, you'll see that our weekly active to monthly active user ratio is at its highest level ever at 61%. That's clear evidence that we're deepening engagement as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters and finding really good success there. Second, we can compete in a world where our peers -- the second question was, can we compete in a world where our peers are all in on short-form video? And I think we're answering that question with a clear yes as well, but doing it on our own terms. Our supply of content is growing. Video content is up 30% quarter-on-quarter. We're finding more efficient ways to get engaging content on Pinterest, serve the needs of our Pinners from inspiration to action. And importantly, while we're seeing more than 10% of our engagement is on video, it's more than 30% of our revenue that is on short-form video. So when we think about monetizing that short-form video, which I think has been an open question broadly, we're seeing really good success in the monetization of short-form video, which I think is unique and stands out. And so further to that point, the question of can we build a monetization engine at scale, absolutely. I couldn't be more excited about the advancements we've made in our ad stack and how that's allowed us to grow monetizable supply north of 15%, higher than overall engagement gains because of tech innovation like whole page optimization, which opportunistically increases ad load when a consumer is in a shopping mode or has a commercial intent. We're building solutions to help advertisers measure results on our platform like our conversion API and our new clean room solution. And while we're early in the adoption curve on those measurement capabilities and those new tools for advertisers, we're seeing that our best share gains, our best growth is coming from the discerning advertisers that are implementing those tools and the more they see visibility into our performance. The more we see that, that performance is clear and I think that bodes well for our future as more and more of those advertisers adopt those tools from us. So while we remain in a demand-challenged environment, I think the improvements we've made to deliver advertiser value are paying off. I think that's why you see us growing faster than many in the peer set. And while demand doesn't flip overnight, we think the setup that we have of deepening engagement, the supply on our platform growing even faster than the deepening engagement with innovations like whole page optimization are making sure we have really great relevance of those ads and allowing us to serve more relevant ads in commercial context, that, coupled with the progress we're making on measurement tools and the performance we're seeing there early in that adoption curve with discerning advertisers, we think all that sets us up really well for the medium to long-term, even as we're fighting through a lot of choppiness in the near-term, just as everybody else is. And then one final point. I think, Eric, you also asked about top priorities. I think I addressed many of these in the call, so I won't belabor those. But I think on each of these points, while we have really great progress, we continue to proceed forward on those. I talked about making sure that we're making our -- all of our core experience as shoppable as well as driving further improvements to engagement and our ad stack. We think we're early in those journeys. We're going to have really good proof points. Those continue to be our priorities. And then finally, the operational rigor, where we've implemented a program around operational rigor, we're seeing good results from that. And importantly, even as we're implementing more operational rigor, we're seeing really good product innovation. And so the comments I've made multiple times around constraints leading to creativity, we're seeing that in action. And we feel really good about the progress on that. Thank you. Yes. Thanks a lot. I'll hit your second question first then give it to Todd to hit your first question. So we definitely think about sourcing ad demand as an opportunity for us. Our first priority is always going to be our direct sales and the partnerships that we're driving there. And we feel really good about the progress that our sales team is making on that and how we're winning with those advertisers that have implemented our latest tools and the most sophisticated and discerning advertisers seeing our performance be the strongest. We feel really good about that first-party selling motion. But we do believe there's an opportunity to augment our demand with third parties. And you mentioned one of those that we've done already around Retail Media Networks. We think there's a lot more opportunity in those. And we also think that leveraging third-party demand has been an underutilized lever here, particularly compared to other platforms. And so that is something that we will continue to explore. While no specific updates on specific deals or specific partners or those kinds of things, I do think that is something that we'll look to take more action on. We're already taking action on it with Retail Media Networks and something that we'll look to continue taking action on more in the near-term. It is not something that I'd put into 2024. It's something that we're actively exploring. And again, no specific updates or specific announcements on what we do there. But we are very much looking at that as a meaningful opportunity in the near-term versus something that would be relegated to the medium or long-term. Maybe on the first question, on the progress we're seeing there, I mentioned in my remarks, shopping ad is growing 50% year-on-year as well as not only solving for shopping, but giving easier conversions, easier ability for the user to connect with the place to buy through our mobile deep linking capabilities. And so I shared how significant the percentage of revenue from shopping apps is coming from mobile deep linking. I think that is an early indicator of just how much we can do not only to make more of our content shoppable, but also our ability to drive that full funnel engagement where we've historically been much stronger at the upper and mid-funnel. But at the lower end of that funnel, we're seeing that low-funnel conversion objective being about a third of our revenue overall in things like mobile deep linking, which we have not had that adopted across the board, but the early adopters of that have seen really strong performance. So, I mentioned that part of what gives me a lot of confidence in our future is much of our performance is coming from early adoption of new conversion tools like -- or new measurement tools like our conversion API and new capabilities like mobile deep linking that right now have been adopted by a smaller set of our larger, more sophisticated advertisers. As we move along that adoption curve, I think that bodes well for how we can compete more broadly, particularly on shopping-type actions, conversion objectives, and these lower-funnel objectives. So, those are really good early indicators that as we move on the adoption curve, I feel quite good about. You asked also about which categories we think of. Shopping is pretty broad based on our platform. There are some obvious ones that you would think about, women's fashion and apparel and those kinds of things that are definitely places where we have very large engagement, significant opportunity. We have other large moment engagement, things like weddings and home redesigns and these kinds of things that are meaningful user behaviors as well. We have some really interesting emerging behavior also. Todd mentioned growth in things like autos and men's fashion, Gen Z being our fastest-growing demographic. So we feel like shopping is a broad-based opportunity. While there are some categories that we will lean into first, we see it as quite broad-based, probably more broad-based than many may appreciate on our platform. Todd, I don't know anything you would add to that? Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we think there's a huge opportunity in moving Pinterest users from episodic usage to more frequent usage. And certainly, when you think about something like shopping as a behavior, those become the kinds of use cases that can be more daily-type use cases versus monthly or quarterly use cases. And so a lot of the progress you've seen from us over the last multiple quarters has been around using good AI and machine learning to get better recommendations, better personalization and using that to provide better recommendations to our users. And we think there's a lot more opportunity to use those nudges to the user to help them find new use cases on Pinterest. And we've got some really good early evidence of that. Again, it's our personalization and the AI capabilities behind that are a lot of what's been driving our improvements in engagement. But yes, we want to move people from episodic use cases to things that are weekly and daily use cases. And again, we feel like we're well on our way there. We are by no means done. But to see things like engagement sessions and multiple measures of engagement at 10%-plus, we feel really great about that. I think the other thing that I mentioned this before, underscore gains, I think it's a big unlock, which is the work that we've done around whole page optimization and demonstrating that ads can be valuable content to the user. If you think about the levers of growth in the businesses, yes, we're going to grow MAUs. But more than that, there's so much what I would call leaked engagement from the platform, where somebody couldn't satisfy their intent here and monetization would occur someplace else. So as we get more and more ability to take action on the things that people are already finding here that's plugging a lot of leaked engagement, a lot of leaked monetization, but then also give the use of reasons to want to come back to us more and then our ability to monetize that as we've made progress with whole page optimization that we launched in Q4. What that's really showing is that in those commercial context, we can actually serve a lot more ads, a lot more relevant ads in ways that are good for the user, helps them satisfy their intent and very highly monetizable for us. So I think that makes me feel really good about our long-term prospects is that we have multiple levers of growth there, like yes, getting from episodic to more monthly, weekly, daily usage, but then within that, playing a lot of that leaked engagement, playing a lot of that leaked monetization and actually being able to bring much more ad load and much more relevant ad load to the platform than what we've had historically. So that's how I think about the way that unfolds over time. And while we've had good early indicators, we are at the very beginning of the potential from that. And I think there's -- if you thought about our monetization on these commercial interactions, I think we're at a fraction of the ad load that you would see in a lot of other places that have these highly commercial intents. So there's a lot more we can do there. We've set the foundation for how we can dynamically take that ad load up in a way that's good for the user, good for the advertiser. That's a foundation that will allow us to grow quite a bit more. And actually tying back into the questions around third-party demand, one of the things you need to do first before you bring in more demand is make sure you've got the supply to be able to serve that demand. With our supply growing -- engagement is growing faster than users, supply is growing faster than engagement, we now very clearly have the supply and the ability to go serve that ad content in a way that's relevant and helpful to the user that we think lets us unlock a lot more potential in the ad platform going forward. Great. Thanks Colin. So, on the shift from episodic to more frequent usage, I think you're seeing some of that reflected already. The progress we've made, as Todd and I both mentioned, around greater personalization, giving you just more reasons to come back, I think that's part of why we're seeing engagement grow much faster than MAUs overall. You asked about a timeframe for MAUs to move beyond seasonal. Again, I would point to focus more towards the overall engagement and the revenue per user rather than MAUs. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have hundreds of millions of users that come to Pinterest that are not in our MAU count that come to us on an episodic basis. And so we're much more focused on how do we drive deeper engagement with the users we have. You can imagine we have a very good view as to where those other users are, which ones monetize well. If we wanted to chase MAUs as a vanity metric, we will chase it as a vanity metric, but they may not be the users that would monetize the best or where we need to go defend our platform the most. And so we're much more focused on deepening the engagement with the users that are in places where we know we need to compete most and where we also have the best monetization opportunity. And so I'd point your attention more towards the accelerating engagement and the accelerating revenue per user on where we go there. And on video, and especially the monetization around video, I think this is a place -- it's one of the most exciting things that I've seen in our work here is that -- prior to my joining Pinterest, a -- I think a commonly held viewpoint on short-form video that I held as well was that the engagement is fantastic. But do the unit economics actually work? Can you make money off of it in a way that more than outstrips the significant increase in the expense was very much an open question? And to say that we have more than 10% of our engagement on video, but more than 30% of our revenue on video, I think, just puts us in a very different place than many others in terms of having found that right balance of how to monetize short-form video and make sure that's driving both engagement and monetization. And we think there's a lot more we can do there. Because we're a lean-forward platform rather than an entertainment platform, the lean-forward nature of our platform, we think we have a lot of license from users to do much more with short-form video. So a question I've been posing to the team is in the same way that images existed on the web before Pinterest, that Pinterest brought new utilities to those images, short-form video has existed independent of Pinterest. But we believe we can bring utility to those short-form videos in ways that others may not, and others may not have user license to do because they have the user in a lean-back entertainment mode. We have the user in a lean-forward intent mode, where we think shoppable content and these kinds of things can be much more well received by our users. And so that's a big part of what comes next for us is that we're looking at how we make video shoppable. We have a really great strength in our team on computer vision. There's lots of talk about AI and how it's advancing. One of the most exciting areas of the next generation of AI is around computer vision. And that's a core competency for us. And so we're using computer vision to make video more shoppable, and some really good early results there. So our new core computer vision model that has over 1 billion-plus parameters has led to an 8% increase in visual search shopping relevance. So these are the kinds of things that we think we can do -- that we think we're already doing quite well in the balance of how to benefit from short-form video, driving gate from that but monetize it well, and we think there's a lot more to come there. I hope that helps. All right. Thanks for the question. So on partnerships, I mean, I think each of the dimensions you mentioned are part of the opportunity. If you use the platform, you can see that there's an opportunity for us to drive increased ad relevance. I feel really great about the progress our sales team has made. But as a smaller platform, even really large, really dense auctions will augment their demand with third-party sources. And so as a smaller player, as great as our sales team has done in driving first-party ad demand, which we are absolutely committed to continuing to do, it's a real asset. We're going to continue to invest in that. If even the largest auctions benefit from augmenting demand with third-party sources, certainly, we can as well. And in doing that, that should give you greater relevance. I think I made the comment earlier around the foundation we've laid with whole page optimization. That sets us up to think about in an integrated way how we bring ads to the user in a way where those ads are relevant content, which we think is -- has a two-fold benefit. One is drive engagement when it truly is -- particularly in a commercial context where that ad could be relevant content for the user. But then secondarily, it lets us serve more ads and take our ad load up from where it's been. And our ad loads has previously been a fraction of what you would expect in other places with the kind of commercial intent that we have. So, ad coverage, increasing relevancy, ad load, these are things that will naturally improve with us over time. But as we think about the benefits potentially of augment third-party sources, retail gate networks or otherwise, we think that's an opportunity, geographies can be an opportunity. And then your final point on pricing, I think -- one of the things that I think is hard to overstate and the progress we've made here is that the whole industry is going through a rewiring on ad measurement and moving from cookies to privacy safe ad measurement solutions. So, while the whole industry is going through that rewiring, we are -- we've provided our conversion API. We've launched our cleanroom efforts. And our early indications there are really positive, but we are very early on that adoption curve. And as we think we move along that adoption curve, we think we actually are performing far better than many advertisers realize far better than what they've been able to measure. And so bringing that greater measurement is a real opportunity. Those are things that we're absolutely going to do first party, but those are also things that as we think about the potential for partnership across the industry, there's multiple different ways that, that can play out. And you've seen us talk about some of those already, like what we did in our cleanroom efforts with LiveRamp and Albertsons. And we think we'll have more of those kinds of opportunities going forward that will help with measurement, and therefore, also help with pricing as advertisers have better visibility into the value we're creating for them. And then on your other question on video, we're kind of not breaking it down quite to the level of specificity that you're asking for. But we're seeing good broad-based engagement on video. I'll give it to Todd, if there's anything more you want to share about video generally. Okay. Thank you. Operator--"

My name is Tia and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations, you may proceed.\nNeil Doshi: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to the Pinterest earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. I'm Yoshi head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Joining me today on the call are Bill Ready Pinterest CEO and Todd Morgenfeld, our Chief Financial Officer and head of business operations.  Now we'll cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance operations, and outlook, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may be considered forward looking and set statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q4 2022 and beyond are preliminary and are not an indication of future performance.  We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent forms 10-Q or 10-K, filed with the SEC and available on the investor relations section of our website.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and in today's earnings press release, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com.  Before we jump in, I'd like to note that we've decided to change our format for earnings communications, we will no longer be publishing a shareholder letter so that we can focus on providing key updates on these calls.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Ready : Thanks, Neil. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. I'm proud of our team's execution in Q3 across user growth, monetization and operating discipline. On the user side, we stabilized the user base and grew sequentially as we returned to seasonal growth trends. Our global revenues of $445 million were above Q3, 2021 as we've largely lapped headwinds from the pandemic unwind and have driven improvements and user engagement. Our U.S. and Canada miles grew sequentially for the first time since Q1 2021 to 95 million. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, they grew revenue by 10% on a constant currency basis to $685 million for Q3.  We delivered adjusted EBIT da of $77 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11%. Each of these points demonstrate that our team is operating with heightened focus and discipline, finding ways to grow the business and drive efficiencies despite the difficult macroeconomic environment.  My remarks today will focus on three topics. First, how we're making Pinterest more relevant and engaging. Second, how we're driving more inspiration to action, including greater shopability, and third, how we continue to improve our monetization efforts to drive value to our advertising partners.  By making Pinterest more relevant to our users, we can increase and deepen our engagement at the platform. We're doing this in multiple ways, including improving the personalization on our core surfaces, leveraging our unique opportunities of the content platform and broadening our appeal to emerging demographics effects.  On personalization, we're creating much more relevant experiences for users by combining the unique first party signal on our platform, with advancements in machine learning to recommend highly relevant content to users. In Q3, this work was a meaningful driver of our return to seasonal sequential growth and global and U.S. and Canada models.  It also resulted in year on year improvement in engagement, as measured by metrics such as sessions, impressions and SES. In fact, sessions in Q3 grew meaningfully faster than now's, which indicates that we are deepening engagement with our users. We believe growing sessions should drive multiple top-line benefits, such as reducing user churn, improving overall monetization and growing revenue per user.  We're also making Pinterest more relevant to users by leveraging our unique human curated content, and upgrading our overall content ecosystem. In short, we want to we want content that not only inspires users, but also helps them make do or buy things. With this goal in mind, here's how we're thinking about human curation and rich media content, which are the two biggest types of content we have on the platform.  The human curation at scale that happens on Pinterest is a highly differentiated invaluable source of content generated by our users. While machine learning helps us serve a personalized recommendation for a pair of women's fall boots, human curation at scale makes it possible for us to further suggest the best skirt and sweater options to complete the look, which we can do because those boots are ones like them have been saved as part of outfits on other boards on Pinterest.  This type of curation is very unique to Pinterest, and is fundamentally different user activity than what typically occurs on other platforms. This creates a highly efficient way to get relevant content for users across our ecosystem. User curated content is a key aspect of our content strategy, and we expect it to remain a significant differentiator. In addition, we're increasingly sourcing rich media content that is uploaded to our platform from a wide variety of sources, including publishers, creators, brands and users. And Q3 content uploaded to Pinterest accounted for nearly half of our saves, which demonstrates that users are finding this type of content highly relevant and engaging.  One of the uploaded rich media formats we're particularly excited about is video. Videos often make it easier for users to get inspired and to make do or buy something. This is especially true for Gen Z users. We've been ramping our video efforts over the past couple of years. Last year, we focused almost exclusively on attracting creators to upload videos on our platform.  However, we've since learned more about the types of videos that resonate with our users, and found that we can also obtain high quality videos, and other forms of rich media content from sources beyond creators. This is both highly efficient and effective. While creators are an important part of this equation, a larger portion of our rich media corpus is coming from users, brands and publishing partners like Tastemade, Refinery 29, Chef Club, Jelly Snack and [Indiscernible]. Over the past year as we've evolved our video upload tools, we've grown our video supply by 3x. Additionally, in October, we announced partnerships with Warner Music Group, Warner Chappell music, Merlyn and BMG to expand the music experience on Pinterest. Through these deals, users will be able to add popular song tracks through a new user experience, which we believe will enable users and creators to engage more deeply and creatively with the platform.  Finally, we're working to expand the relevance of our platform to emerging audiences, specifically Gen Z by building products and experiences that resonate with them. Over the past three years, growth from our global Gen Z demographic has outpaced growth from all other demos, and Gen Z users continue to grow despite the pandemic online, and SEO headwinds. In Q3, Gen Z grew double digits year over year, accelerating from Q2. This trend supports our thesis that Gen Z gets something on Pinterest that is distinct from what they get on other popular platforms, namely, a place to discover with intent and purpose and to explore their creativity.  Nowhere was this more clear to us in Q3 than in the enthusiastic reception of shuffles our standalone collage making app, which is available on an invite only basis to iOS users. The vast majority of shuffled users are in the Gen Z demo. And we've been watching with interest as they find novel ways to use shuffles such as remix each other shuffles to collaborate on ideas, like creating the perfect stranger things Halloween costume. We continue to iterate and learn from this beta launch, and plan to add new features and functionality to shuffle as we make it more widely available.  Next I'll discuss our approach to driving more inspiration and intent to action. At the highest level, we believe shopping on Pinterest drives and informs the core experience of the service rather than being distinct from or bolted on to that core experience. This is supported by the fact that more than half of users we've surveyed view Pinterest as a place to shop. Over time, we expect to make every product that the user encounters on Pinterest shoppable, even when that product may be in a scene or other user-generated content. This means pins on all our surfaces should be shoppable, not just the ones on a designated Shop tab. While we have computer vision capabilities, machine learning, human curation at scale and over 1 billion items in our product catalog, we also need to continue growing our product catalog to enable more of these shopping experiences. To that end, we released our API for shopping to general availability in Q3 across all of our shopping-enabled countries, which include the U.S. and our largest markets in Europe, Latin America and APAC. Our API for shopping makes it easier for merchants to upload their catalogs and metadata while also sending real-time data on SKU-level pricing and inventory. On the discoverability side, we're leveraging both machine learning and the first-party signals we get from the unique human curation on Pinterest. If you're looking for a mid-century modern couch, we should be able to show you tables, rugs and lamps to complete that room based on how millions of users have saved and organized home decor content. I think this is a superpower for us as we become the home for digital taste base shopping. Finally, we have an opportunity to become an even more trusted partner to retailers by helping send more traffic, attributable conversions and customers to their businesses. We can deliver high-quality shopping experiences in partnership with retailers by creating frictionless handoffs with the merchant for things that people want to buy. For example, we're piloting a hosted checkout program with Shopify that allows users to check out directly with the merchant while on Pinterest. We are also testing mobile deep linking that takes users straight to the retailer's app and checkout page.  Our efforts on personalization relevance and shopping are also instrumental in creating more value for advertisers. Pinterest is a unique place for advertisers because our users seek inspiration and discovery with intent and purpose. This has a number of implications. To begin with, we have on-platform, first-party signals like searches, saves and board curation that translate into highly valuable and monetizable customer insights for advertisers and resilient on-platform ad personalization and optimization.  In addition, we have full-funnel ad solutions as users come to us throughout the stages of their purchase journey. We've built our ad platform so advertisers can meet users at every stage of their purchasing journey, as they move from ideation, where brand advertising is most effective; to consideration, where a traffic campaign makes sense; to taking action, where conversion objectives are optimal. Revenue from our ads align with these three objectives with approximately one thirds of our revenue coming from each. Moreover, we're making ads more performant on Pinterest through insight-led selling, better automation and improved tools, measurement and formats. Our results show that this is working. Approximately 90% of our active advertisers now use automated bidding. And in Q3, our attributed conversions grew over 20% year-on-year driven by improvements we've made in ads optimization and conversion visibility. Before I hand over to Todd, I want to share my thoughts on how we operate the business. 2022 was a year of elevated investment for Pinterest as we leaned into a number of initiatives that we believe will drive durable, long-term growth. Additionally, the team and I have gone through an extensive review of our portfolio of initiatives to be sure we're focused on the highest-yielding activities. The benefits of that additional investment and heightened focus are coming through in product impact, particularly in engagement and revenue. We're also focused on driving efficiencies in the business. As we discussed on the last call, we intend to return to meaningful margin expansion next year and have already started those efforts. Lastly, we have a strong balance sheet with roughly $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our primary use of capital is to invest in the business to drive continued growth. In addition, Todd and I continue to evaluate our broader capital allocation strategy, including a plan to manage dilution from stock-based compensation. Now I'll turn it over to Todd to discuss our financial results and guidance.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Thanks, Bill. Our Q3 financial performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our full-funnel advertising platform, a platform that mirrors the user journey from inspiration to action and that delivers compelling results for advertisers across multiple objectives, including awareness, consideration and conversions. When you can address the entire consumer journey, it presents a significant monetization opportunity. We've been focused on this strategy for a while, and it's been working. Over the last three years, from Q3 of 2019 to Q3 of 2022, we've grown our global users at an 11% compound annual growth rate. In the same time frame, our revenue grew more than three times faster at a 35% CAGR. This ability to grow revenue faster than users has been driven by ads innovation. And while we're happy with our results today, we think there's a lot more to come in this area. We also believe that we have an opportunity to further grow our revenue per user by deepening engagement with existing users who visit Pinterest more episodically than monthly active users. Bill mentioned the momentum we're seeing in sessions growth, and we're now leaning into this strategy. Turning to our engagement trends in the third quarter. During the quarter, 445 million global monthly active users came to Pinterest, flat year-over-year and up 12 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. We believe that the investments we've made and the user experience were the primary drivers to return to seasonal growth patterns from Q2 to Q3. We also received a modest onetime benefit from the iOS 16 update in September, which contributed to our sequential growth in global monthly active users and U. S. and Canada monthly active users. Looking at the U.S. and Canada. MAUs were 95 million, increasing 3% sequentially with the addition of 3 million users. This is the first time monthly active users have grown sequentially in this region since the first quarter of 2021. Our global mobile app MAU growth accelerated to 11% year-over-year in Q3, and U.S. and Canada mobile application users grew 3% year-over-year, showing positive growth for the first time this year. So while our desktop and mobile web MAUs declined in Q3, our mobile app MAUs continued to show greater resilience. As a reminder, mobile application MAUs account for over 80% of our total impressions and revenue. Looking ahead, we've moved beyond the pandemic unwind. And by the end of the year, we will have lapped the Google Search algorithm update from November 2021 that had an impact on our ability to grow MAUs. We feel good about the health of the user base, and we're much more focused now on deepening engagement and driving revenue per user. Turning to our financial performance. Third quarter global revenue of $685 million grew 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 8% on a reported basis. Total U.S. and Canada revenue was $575 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This is an acceleration from last quarter's 7% growth rate. U.S. and Canada ARPU of $6.13 grew 15% year-over-year. Better-than-expected strength came from large U.S. retail advertisers who have been more resilient and often seek lower-funnel objectives and shopping goals. CPG advertiser revenue grew modestly year-over-year for the first time all year as we lapped the initial supply chain issues that these businesses faced this time last year. Our shopping ads revenue, which comes from promoted catalogs, grew 50% year-over-year, accelerating from the quarter prior. We're beginning to see traction in some of our emerging verticals like automotive, financial services and travel. These segments grew significantly faster than our overall revenue. And in general, we continue to evolve more from a previously experimental platform into an always-on and trusted advertising partner. Total revenue from Europe was $86 million, growing 8% on a constant currency basis but declining 4% on a reported basis due to significant foreign exchange headwinds. Our European advertisers remain concerned about the current recession impacting that region as inflation and energy costs are affecting consumer demand. Total revenue from our Rest of World region was $24 million, growing 41% on a constant currency basis and 36% on a reported basis. During the quarter, we launched advertisements in Argentina, Chile and Colombia as we added to our presence in the LatAm market. However, weak consumer spending created challenges for our more price-sensitive global mid-market and SMB advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we've been focused on building a durable performance advertising business that allows advertisers to meet users across the entire funnel. This has never been more important than today when CMOs are focused on marketing spend that drives measurable returns. In addition, our positive platform, our users' commercial intent and our ability to deliver insights-led selling drive unique value for advertisers that's just difficult to find elsewhere. In Q3, we expanded the Pinterest Trends tool from beta to general availability to help advertisers around the world get deeper insights into user planning behavior to inform the early campaign planning stage. Aligning with trends on Pinterest helps advertisers develop relevant campaigns that resonate with their audience based on real-time interests, leading to increased performance. In October, we announced that we've expanded the Pinterest Trends tool from the U.S., UK and Canada to 30 additional countries. For example, Ashley Furniture Canada tapped into growing home trends on Pinterest using our Pinterest Trends tool to align their products with emerging home decor styles. Knowing that terms like Boho chic and modern farmhouse were top home decor trends on Pinterest, they designed their campaign visuals to highlight how their products could bring these trends to life. In doing so, Ashley Furniture drove a 71% increase in click-through rates and a 12% increase in returns on ad spend in their conversion campaigns. We continue to innovate in tools and formats to improve automation. Our new API for conversions helps explain Pinterest's contribution to attributable conversions to advertisers. We're seeing encouraging adoption of the tool by our advertisers with its most frequent use case being lower-funnel actions such as checkouts. Beta results have shown impressive performance with a 30% -- 36% increase in attributed conversion volume when using both conversion API and tags compared to using tags only. Turning to our expense profile. Cost of revenue increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We're investing in models to make product experiences more personalized and relevant for our users while also delivering improved ROI for our advertisers. We're beginning to see impact from these investments in our current results and believe that they will continue to drive further improvements in engagement and revenue over time. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $434 million in the third quarter, up 38% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. This was lower than our prior guidance in part due to a decision to shift a portion of our brand marketing spend from the third to the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million in the third quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11%. We ended the quarter with about $2.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning to our preliminary outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to grow in the mid-single digits percentage range year-over-year. That includes approximately three percentage points of headwind from foreign exchange, slightly greater when compared to the third quarter. Many of our advertisers are navigating a challenging environment with higher inflation and weakening consumer demand. This creates a volatile demand environment globally. Given this uncertainty, we believe there could be a wider range of outcomes this quarter, including some downside risk, especially as our Q4 revenue tends to be back-end weighted. On expenses, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double digits percentage range sequentially as we shifted a portion of our brand marketing campaign into Q4. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to grow around 35% year-over-year, at the low end of the range we communicated at the start of the year. We firmly believe the investments we made this year will enable us to continue innovating to enhance both the user experience and our advertising platform. As we exit 2022, we're focused on maximizing the return from these investments. We are still committed to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill before we open it up to Q&A.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Todd. I want to say a few words about how I approach these earnings updates because it's a bit different from how we've done things in the past. I consider communications with and feedback from investors a key priority. I view our quarterly earnings calls as one of the best channels to inform investors and analysts about the most important topics in the business, and I expect to increase the overall dialogue with our investors and analysts. And I look forward to sharing more with you when we set our Investor Day in 2023. Finally, I want to thank our team Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. And hope everyone well on the team. Maybe coming back to a point you both made in the prepared remarks, as we turn the page on '22 and what you highlighted as an investment year, how should we be thinking about what those key investment priorities, whether it's product or platform or as we go from '22 and to '23? And if we're trying to think about what the potential impact of those priorities are, whether it be revenue growth building in '23 and beyond or the potential for margin expansion and potential in '23 and beyond, how would you frame the output from those investment priorities? Thanks. \nBill Ready: Thanks, Eric, for the question. So a couple of things I'd say. First of all, we've really been focused on bringing clarity, focus and operating discipline to the business. And on each of those, I'd say, on the clarity side, we're a visual discovery platform with three really unique attributes: first, that we're a positive place on the Internet; second, that our users come here with high intent. So while we're a discovery platform, users have intent, which is quite different from other platforms; and then third, the human curation that happens on our platform is quite unique. And so with that clarity, we're really focused on things that can drive differentiation based on those unique attributes of our platform and making sure that we're operating well and tying these initiatives across our different functions and making sure that we're focused on the highest-yielding activities. As we go into '23, we're glad that we've stabilized the user base and returned to seasonal growth on users. And we think we've got a great ARPU story as we continue to move forward with the business. We're driving more relevance with users, and we're doing that really by leaning into these unique attributes of the platform, both in terms of how we take inspiration to action with things like shopping, making more of the content that users find on Pinterest actionable and bringing more relevant content to users, particularly content that is coming from efficient sources like user-generated content on our platform as well as what we can do with publishers and then, of course, creators also. And then finally, innovation on ad tech, where we've been making really good progress on what we're doing on the ad tech side, but we think there's a lot more that we can do there. So again, I think you're seeing some of this reflected in the results this quarter, but we think there's a lot of upside yet to go on each of those points. I'll pause. Is there anything, Todd, do you want to add to that?\nTodd Morgenfeld : No. I don't have much to add. I would say that, to Bill's point on starting to see the results, you saw it in the financial results with strength from many of our core customer base in large retail and even some falling in the CPG market for us. But it's also worth noting that in addition to the stability in the user base and even the sequential growth that we saw, Bill had referenced some sessions growth meaningfully above our user growth. We saw an improvement in saves, impressions, board creates in the U.S. and other good signals that we're now in a position to drive that ARPU story that Bill described.\nEric Sheridan : Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. You may proceed.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thanks very much. I have a couple. First off, Todd, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the puts and takes with respect to the Q4 guide just given the moving parts you discussed on the macro front and the various platform initiatives. And then, Bill, I was hoping you could then maybe expand on the lower-funnel shopping integrations, including checkout and some of the beta tests, if your view or strategy here has evolved since you first joined Pinterest and if these are already moving the needle or if they have a longer cycle time, perhaps in the next year, before they contribute meaningfully to growth. Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Colin, thanks for the question. I'll start with your first one on puts and takes around Q4 guidance. And then as you mentioned, Bill can speak to some of the lower-funnel work that we're doing. Currently, the headline is that October is trending, very roughly speaking, at the low end of our Q4 guidance of that guidance range that we described in the opening remarks. We've been executing very well in this environment overall and relative to others in the industry, which have been very encouraging. As you know, though, Q4 revenue is back-end weighted to November and December given holiday seasonal moments. And given this and the overall ad market volatility, there could be a wider range of outcomes, including some downside risk to our guidance. When we gave our Q3 guidance of mid-single digits growth during our Q2 earnings call in July, we indicated that July was trending slightly above that guide. And at this point, October today is trending at the low end of the Q4 guidance range, and our guide assumes a modest pickup in demand for November and December from today. It's also worth noting that our guide includes about three percentage points of headwind to revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter from foreign exchange headwinds, which is slightly greater when compared to the third quarter.\nBill Ready: Yeah. And on your questions on lower funnel and shopping, Colin, we think there's a lot more we can do to drive intent to action across the platform. This is one of the things we think makes us very different than other discovery platform is that we have discovery with intent and purpose. And so there's a lot more that we can do to drive that intent to action. Shopping is a particular area of focus for us on that. On the strategy there, what we're really doing is looking to go meet the user where they are on the platform. We see that more than half of users on Pinterest are here to shop. They're telling us that directly. And we've had experiments with things like shopping tabs that have been sort of a part of the experience but not necessarily been core to the experience. Moving forward, we're making shopping more core to the experience. That's what users are looking for from Pinterest already. So we're quite confident in that meeting a real user need. And you can see progress on the shopping front already. For example, our Q3 revenue from shopping ads grew 50% year-on-year. So that's a good indication of the progress there. And the things you can look to see more from us, as I mentioned in my comments, starting to make every product you encounter on Pinterest shoppable regardless whether that product appeared in a scene or user-generated content. And then taking the discovery that's happening on Pinterest and making sure that for all that great discovery of products that users are finding on Pinterest, they have a clear way to take action on that, which has not always been the case historically. So going forward, we want to make sure there's much more actionability on that. And that actionability can be a hosted checkout like what we're doing with Shopify, where the user still is checking out directly with the merchant, but they're doing it in context on our platform or it can be a high-quality handoff to the retailer or the merchant like with the mobile deep link that gives the user a seamless connection with where to buy. And as we do that, we think that not only can address a lot of leaked engagement on our platform because historically, since the actionability was less, users would find things on Pinterest and then oftentimes have to go search someplace else to find where to buy them. As we give the user more actionability, we think that not only plugs leaked engagement from the platform, brings engagement back to -- deep engagement on our platform, it's also a very highly monetizable event as well. And you're already seeing that progress in our shopping ads, and we expect more of that to continue.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thank you.\nBill Ready: Next question, operator. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nMark Mahaney : Can I try two questions, please. First, these music partnerships that you talk about, would that possibly lead to newer revenue streams? Are there different ways to monetize if you bring in music? And then secondly, Bill, I want to ask you just about AI and machine learning investments, and there seems to be a dramatic step-up in investments kind of across the industry just in that. How do you see -- is there something dramatically different that you think can be done at Pinterest with greater investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning? Thanks. That's it.\nBill Ready: Thanks for the questions, Mark. First on the music partnerships, we look at that really as a way to make our content more attractive for users. You've seen us making good progress on that, particularly in finding efficient ways to source new content. If you look at where we had been, it was almost entirely focused on creators.  We now look at creators as a part of that strategy, but there's a broader strategy on content and is looking at all the sources of content, including from publishers and partners. And this is an example of a partner. So I view this more in our broader content strategy and how we're getting more refined on the kinds of content that resonate with our users, which tend to be content that helps users satisfy intent and has a purpose and the fact that we're broadening out our sources of content for that, which generally should lead to better monetization opportunities overall over time. On your machine learning question, it's a fantastic question. And one of the things that I found quite compelling about Pinterest as part of why I joined is that machine learning is a utility that many have access to. Machine learning, though, is only as good as the signal that it's acting upon. And the human curation that happens on Pinterest, I think, is fundamentally different than the user engagement that happens on other platforms. Most of the other platforms in the discovery arena tend to be lean-back consumption platforms. And I think this is why you see as platforms like Apple have implemented privacy changes and diminish the ability to use signals like third-party cookies. And you're seeing that have different impacts on different platforms. In a platform like Pinterest that has user intent on the platform, you're seeing that stand out. You're seeing that be more resilient and being able to show relevant things to users.  But the human curation on our platform, the fact that users come to Pinterest and tell us what types of outfits go together, what types of home decor go together, what kind of decorations go together well, that is really rich signal that our machine learning can act upon. That is fundamentally different than the signal that you would get on a lean back consumption platform where your signals primarily views versus here, we have the user lean forward, engaging, curating, creating, making these associations directly on our platform. And we think that's a very powerful signal that is feeding our machine learning and where we think we can continue to make really great advances and relevance and really outpace what we think is happening in a lot of the rest of the visual discovery arena where there's a lack of intent -- or tends to be a lack of intent. And so it's a place where you're seeing that in our user engagement results already and some of the improvements there. But we think that's something where we have a lot of future potential to continue.\nMark Mahaney : Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. You may proceed.\nRoss Sandler : Hey, guys. Nice job on the quarter. A question on international. So if we look at the international ad revenue opportunity, there are some countries where consumers engage with shopping apps different than they do in the U.S. There's like live commerce, other things going on. And hence, the monetization opportunity could be more robust in one country versus the other. And if we look at like some of your more mature peers like maybe Facebook, there's a pretty normal spread between the ARPU in the U.S. in places like Europe and ROW. And the gap here with Pinterest is obviously reflecting that your U.S. business is far more mature than these international countries. So the question is like, is there anything structural that we should think about that would make your international story different? And then how quickly do you expect these new countries that you're lighting up to ramp up? Is it direct sales, self-serve? And kind of can you just explain like a Japan or some of these newer countries, how quickly they're ramping up? Thanks a lot.\nBill Ready: All right. Thanks for the question. I'll start there and then give it to Todd to fill in some more on it. International, we definitely think there's opportunity there. You see good growth from us in some of the markets, and Todd will talk more about that. What I would say generally on shopping is we -- the thing that we believe makes us very different than other platforms, which I talked about around the intent on our platform, the human curation on our platform that gives us much richer signal than you would find in a lot of other visual discovery platforms, I think puts us in a really great position to solve the full funnel for shopping. We're a full-funnel platform, and I think you see that resonating with advertisers on our platform. And we've historically been stronger in upper and mid. We're doing more in lower funnel. So I think we're uniquely positioned across markets to address that full funnel. In a lot of ways, the first 20-plus years of e-commerce were solving for buying and not as much for the shopping part of the equation, which was sort of walking a bazaar, going into the mall and not knowing what you wanted to buy but having a general sense and then discovering. That hasn't been fully solved in the digital world. And I think -- what you see from us around our ability to create great visual exploration with really great recommendations and really rich first-party signal lets us go solve that full fundamental experience in the digital world in a way that just has not been fully solved as of yet. I think that's our primary differentiator, and it cuts across markets. And there may be things that are specific to different markets that we may tune to in one market or the next. But I think that differentiation in tying that full funnel together, I believe, is quite unique in e-commerce generally and cuts across markets. At the same time, we are managing to grow in international markets. We launched shopping last year in the EU. So it's relatively new, but we're seeing it grow well. And maybe I'll hand off to Todd there to talk about the various efforts across the markets there.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Ross, thanks for the question. I think when you take a step back and you think about the user experience and the use cases that people come to Pinterest for, the mindset of our users, that same commercial intent and planning mindset that folks bring to Pinterest in the U.S., that's very similar in our non-U.S. markets, too. So similar use cases, generally similar demographics, which is a good starting point. We were just later to begin monetizing outside of the U.S., starting more in Western Europe and then moving to Latin America and then just launching in Japan a few months ago. So very early in general, but especially early in LatAm and in APAC. There are aspects of these markets that's a little unique. So for example, you may recall when we were talking about scaling in EMEA or Europe that we noted at the time that one of the differences in the market is more agency concentration or more agency-centric selling. And so we talked about launching business access as a tool to help us navigate the agency relationships there. So there are aspects of the product experience that need to be tweaked for these markets. But when you start with why do people come to Pinterest, what do they use it for, what is their mindset, the full-funnel experience that Bill described going from idea or intent to action and marrying that against advertiser objectives, it's very similar. And it's just a question of the depth of the ad market and the prices folks are willing to pay for those slots. Is that helpful?\nRoss Sandler: Yes. Super helpful, guys.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. I appreciate the color about session growth. It's pretty interesting. I'd be curious to hear about what you can share on search behavior, whether it's search queries or number of people who are searching, anything, Bill. I know with your search background, you could help us understand the behavior you see in searching, perhaps another monetization driver. And then the second one, maybe it's a little technical, but I'm just curious to hear -- the Shopify partnership has been around for quite some time now. Can you just give us some examples of blocking and tackling in the back end where you're going to be able to accelerate the merchants and the SKUs per merchant that really come on to the platform and are integrated into the experience at a faster pace? Thanks. \nBill Ready: Thanks, Brian. Great questions. So on the session growth, yes, we were feeling good about the progress there, indicating that we're deeply engaging with our users and we think highlights the opportunity for us to continue to drive ARPU growth, which we think of as even more important than MAU growth going forward given the opportunity to do more to bring those users from episodic usage to more frequent usage. Answer on your question, we -- search is a part of what you come to the platform for. And if you look at the upper, mid- and lower funnel, and I touched on this in the comments, our revenue is split roughly third, third, third across those stages of the funnel. I'd say that lower funnel is the place where the product is even more nascent. So even though we see considerable search volume on the platform today, the fact that we do have such high intent and so many people are here to shop, we do think that lower funnel is a place that we can strengthen more and more shopping is a key part of that. And so to your second question around accelerating efforts to bring those merchants on -- so we've had good integrations with Shopify. I talked about the shopping API that we put out that really makes it much easier for merchants to go publish our catalog to us. We're at 1 billion items in the catalog now. We think there's billions more that we can add to that. And so having an API that retailers can use to not only publish our catalogs to us but also give real-time updates on inventory and pricing, we think will really help that. But then the other part of that, that is really important, and I mentioned this earlier, is shifting from shopping being a separate tab or a separate activity or a thing that a user has to seek out on the platform versus meeting the user where they are in making the products that they encounter naturally on the platform naturally shoppable. And so as we do more and more of that, we think that will really create a lot more opportunity to drive that lower-funnel activity, and search is a part of that. But really, it's the visual discovery journey and the fact that we know we have users here with intent and making that intent much more easily actionable, we think, is the broader opportunity for us. And again, you see progress on it from us already with the shopping ads growing 50% year-on-year. But we're still relatively early days there, and so we're excited. There's a lot to go.\nBrian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Bill.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Brian. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please proceed.\nRich Greenfield : Thanks for taking the question. I got two. One, I just want to follow up, Bill. You sort of inferred or implied in talking about October being sort of at the bottom end of the range. Just given sort of the macro headwinds that we've heard from whether it be Meta or Snap or Comcast this morning or just a few minutes ago, Amazon printing, everyone is sort of talking about sort of a very rough challenging macro. I guess I'm curious, why not just be more conservative in the Q4 guide given where October was trending? Is there something specific that you're looking to that gives you confidence in sort of a pickup in November and December? Is it sort of due to sort of the shopping nature of Pinterest and why you think you sort of accelerate or improve in the back two months of the quarter? And then just -- you laid out a lot of, I think, really good plausible drivers of Pinterest over the course of the next few years. Now that you've had a few months sink your teeth and if you had to kind of point out one thing, whether you mentioned it or not on the call so far. But what's sort of the one thing that you're most excited about creating value at Pinterest over the next 12 months? Thanks for taking the question. \nBill Ready: All right. Thanks, Rich. I'll start with a couple of thoughts on your question on the macro and then give it to Todd to fill in there. If you look at this quarter, I think you look at us relative to our peer set. And I think it's pretty clear that in a tough macro, we found ways to differentiate and outpace a decelerating ad market. And yes, as we go into Q4, you're seeing projections from others, there's a lot of expectations around that, that will continue to decelerate. At the same time, we think there's a lot that we're doing that is cutting through. But Todd talked about the wider rain around the outcomes is an inherently back-weighted quarter with holiday shopping, and holiday shopping is something people spend a lot of time on Pinterest for holiday activities, not just shopping, but things like how they think about their decor, how do they think about planning for events, how do they think about recipes and all these kinds of things that really drive a lot of engagement during Q4. But as Todd mentioned, it's a back-weighted quarter. And so that's why there's a wider range around that.  I'll pause and let Todd add into that before I come to the second part of your question.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Yeah. Rich, I mean, for sure, wanted to make sure -- I want to make sure folks understood that we're keenly aware of the environment we're operating in and what's happening in the industry. And I was hoping to call that out, the wider range of outcomes, the back-end-weighted nature of the quarter in general in Q4 for us and call out some of that risk and the wider range that may unfold. But this is our best call on where we're headed for the quarter. And I think what you can take away from that is we have a large concentration of larger retailer advertisers and large CPG advertisers that if you roll the clock back a couple of years when we were in the earlier days of the pandemic, those were the advertisers that were disproportionately slowed. And we looked relatively weak compared to the industry because we didn't have crypto, gaming apps, app download to the extent that others did. In this environment, we're seeing relative strength with those larger retailers. And with the falling in the CPG market, we saw more resilience there in the third quarter, and we're expecting some more resilience there in the fourth quarter.  The last thing I would say is that we had called out -- I made mention of it in words in my script around graduating from experimental to kind of always-on budgets. And we had talked about last quarter how our joint business partnership deal volume had grown in the first half of the year, 25% year-over-year. Those are non-contractual but indications of large advertiser spend commitments. We saw that number grow to 35% year-over-year -- year-to-date in terms of JVP deal volume, joint business partnership deal volume in the third quarter. So that gives us some indication that we are an important platform for advertisers that really need to reach consumers during a period when they're shopping. And I'm hopeful that it plays out the way we described.\nBill Ready: On your second question, Rich, you asked me for one thing that we cut through the most. I'll give you two, but they're related. So the first I've talked about a bunch, which is driving more of the intent to action. We know the user has strong intent here, but we haven't always made it as easy as it could be for them to take action on that. So we think as we make more of the things people are discovering on Pinterest directly actionable, we think there's a lot of lift in engagement that comes from that. But the same thing that's related to it is our ad platform is younger than many of the other platforms out there. And so you're seeing us make advancements in maturing the platform. As we drive greater maturity in our ad platform, there's a lot of upside in delivering more insight, more measurability to our advertising partners. And again, I think you see some of that reflected in our results with conversion year-on-year being up 20%, us giving more tools to advertisers and insights around these things.  As we make that more and more mature, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity on that as well. And obviously, these two things relate to one another because that intent to action really rounds out the lower-funnel part of our story, making us a truly unique full-funnel platform that can engage with the user across every stage of their purchasing journey. So those are the two very related things, I would say, I think, have the most opportunity to really cut through and drive continued improvement for us as we go into next year.\nRich Greenfield : That's really helpful. Can I just ask a follow-up on that, the acceleration in the back half of the quarter or the back two months of the quarter? Is the Google sort of lapping which happens in November, how does that factor into that as well? For Bill or for Todd?\nTodd Morgenfeld : Well, it's a little bit indirect, right? The Google lapping was an algorithm change that effectively slowed the traffic we were getting from search to the platform, so users coming to the platform through search activity, which, in general, tended to be more web-based users. I called out the success we've had in growing our mobile application user base, which has been the most resilient part of our user engagement story. That's where we make almost all of our -- I mean not all, a significant majority. Over 80% of our revenue and our impressions come from those mobile app users.  So I would disaggregate the Google Search impact to revenue because we've been able to continue our financial performance despite some search algorithm changes. We did see, as I called out, resilience and stabilization and even a return to our normal seasonal growth patterns with users in the third quarter, and I would expect that to continue. But we are lapping that SEO change at the end of last year. I guess, if you were to really pick at it, you'd say that we would hopefully see some increase in monetizable supply as a result of some of these changes, but that would be at the margin.\nBill Ready: Operator next question.\nOperator: Absolutely. The next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley : Great. Thanks guys. First, Bill, I just want to thank you for your interest in engaging with investors and analysts. Not necessarily the norm in the space, so nice breath of fresh air. First question, just wanted to go back to the comment on seeing more always-on budget. Traditionally, we think of that as more direct response and a function of ROI improvements. And when that happens, budget tends to scale up, not just kind of be always on but leaning into ROI. So is that what we're seeing? Are we thinking about it right? It's mostly DR and really kind of position you to see kind of same client budget scale? And then the second one would just be about the third-party video content that you talked about at the beginning of the call. Can you just help us understand the margin implications of that and kind of what those deals look like? Are these like typical rev shares? Are they fixed cost licensing deals? Do any of the partner sell ads and like share revenue with you? And like how do we think about all the impact of those deals on the P&L? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yeah. Maybe I'll take the second one first and then give it to Todd on your first question. On the video side, I would say, each of those deals are -- I would not expect to have a material impact on margin or things like that. The macro point to take away is as we have refined our content strategy, we're finding efficient ways to go get really high-quality content that resonates with our users. So while the teams have been experimenting with short-form video for a couple of years now, there's a lot of good learnings there around the type of video content that resonates with users on Pinterest, which is oftentimes different than the video content that may resonate for those users or -- resonating for users on other platforms because users have more intent and purpose here. It's less about entertainment, and it's more about intent and purpose, which means there are often different kinds of videos that are resonant. And so finding partnerships to source those is quite efficient as compared to creator ecosystem. Again, creators are an important part of that strategy. But whereas they were most of the strategy previously. They're now a part of that strategy. And I look at these third-party partnerships as broadening out the content strategy, broadening our sources in a way that is more efficient than what you would have seen in a content -- or a creator-only content strategy. So while these deals specifically don't have some sort of negative impact to margin, I think on our longer-term strategy, you're seeing us focus on efficient ways to source content both of these third-party deals. And then I'd finally call out the creation and curation that happens on our platform is really important content as well. I've talked several times about the value of the human curation on our platform. That curation is content creation, and it's a lot of the content that our users are seeking as they're trying to put together an outfit or put together a room or put together a holiday party. The pins that come onto our platform, the board is the people curing on our platform are giving a lot of that content that we really need to service. So that's really efficient content sourcing as well. And I'll turn it over to Todd for the other part of your question.\nTodd Morgenfeld : Lloyd, thanks for the question. What I wanted to make sure you understood is -- Bill spent a lot of time in his opening remarks talking about this full-funnel platform that we've built. We have our users that go from intent to action. Our advertisers want to be there with awareness, consideration or traffic or conversion campaigns and shopping campaigns at the lower part of the funnel. When I talked about our success in driving those joint business partnerships, again, they're not contractual deals. They're indications of interest to spend, and they're not necessarily designed against a specific objective. What we're seeing is that we're getting -- we're having success even with advertisers that are typically more awareness-oriented, so think traditional CPG advertisers, exploring ways of moving down funnel. With our retail advertisers signing these commitments, we're seeing them move up funnel. And so we're -- to Bill's comments about us being a full-funnel platform, in these joint business partnerships, we're seeing an interest in advertising against awareness, consideration and conversion objectives, and that's been really encouraging to me. And then lastly, we have seen that total deal volume dollars under those commitments grow now year-to-date 35% year-over-year, which is 10 points faster than what we were last quarter. So pretty good -- I think a lot of confidence with large sophisticated advertisers in the platform.\nBill Ready: Operator we'll take our last question. \nLloyd Walmsley : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you and of course. The last question is from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking questions. Just two quick ones. Bill, you mentioned just innovation in ad tech going forward. Can you just talk for a minute about building out self-serve and how far along you are here? And then also Shuffles driving a lot of the Gen Z growth in 3Q, how do you leverage that into the core platform to drive repeated use and engagement? Thank you.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Doug. On the ad innovation side, as I mentioned, like we're early on in our ad -- relatively early on in our ad platform compared to others. And I think some of the things we've talked about in terms of better conversion visibility, better trends visibility, the adoption of automation by our advertising partners, these are all things we think there's a lot of continued yield. Self-serve is an opportunity for us. We're probably even more nascent in our self-serve capabilities. So longer term, I'd say there's a large opportunity for us. I'd say in the near term, a lot of those smaller advertisers that would be more inclined towards self-serve have been some of the hardest impacted. And so fortunately, that's a smaller part of our business. It's one that we still very much believe in over the long term. But our focus is on building out the maturity of the ad platform more broadly right now. And then self-serve, we'll continue to invest there, but we view it as smaller in the near term, but it's still quite important in the long term.  And then on the Shuffles side, yes, Shuffles has seen really phenomenal reception. And I think it really speaks to interesting use cases that people expect on Pinterest. The user is just in a different mode on Pinterest than they are on other platforms. I talked about the users in a lean-forward mode on Pinterest versus a lean-back mode on other platforms. And it's very hard to change the sort of headspace the user's in when they're in an app or on a platform. So the fact we have user in that lean-forward mode, I think Shuffles is just one example of the way that we can extend use cases with our users that are uniquely Pinterest, take advantage of the lean-forward mode that you just have with us. And then to your question on Gen Z, I want to be clear, and I think I touched on this in my comments, our Gen Z traction is not just about Shuffles. We're finding really great Gen Z traction in the core platform already. So I cited some of those stats around the growth there in my prepared remarks. Shuffles we think only adds to that. And to your question, we are looking at ways we can draw more connectivity between Shuffles and the Pinterest app. So it's already the case that when you're in Shuffles, you can connect your Pinterest boards and these kinds of things. So there's connections between these two already. And we think there's more and more of these natural connections that can happen between the two so that each is enhancing the other. All right. Thank you again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. And as I mentioned earlier, we really look forward to keeping this dialogue going with all of you. We appreciate your feedback, and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Our Q3 financial performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our full-funnel advertising platform, a platform that mirrors the user journey from inspiration to action and that delivers compelling results for advertisers across multiple objectives, including awareness, consideration and conversions. When you can address the entire consumer journey, it presents a significant monetization opportunity. We've been focused on this strategy for a while, and it's been working. Over the last three years, from Q3 of 2019 to Q3 of 2022, we've grown our global users at an 11% compound annual growth rate. In the same time frame, our revenue grew more than three times faster at a 35% CAGR. This ability to grow revenue faster than users has been driven by ads innovation. And while we're happy with our results today, we think there's a lot more to come in this area. We also believe that we have an opportunity to further grow our revenue per user by deepening engagement with existing users who visit Pinterest more episodically than monthly active users. Bill mentioned the momentum we're seeing in sessions growth, and we're now leaning into this strategy. Turning to our engagement trends in the third quarter. During the quarter, 445 million global monthly active users came to Pinterest, flat year-over-year and up 12 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. We believe that the investments we've made and the user experience were the primary drivers to return to seasonal growth patterns from Q2 to Q3. We also received a modest onetime benefit from the iOS 16 update in September, which contributed to our sequential growth in global monthly active users and U. S. and Canada monthly active users. Looking at the U.S. and Canada. MAUs were 95 million, increasing 3% sequentially with the addition of 3 million users. This is the first time monthly active users have grown sequentially in this region since the first quarter of 2021. Our global mobile app MAU growth accelerated to 11% year-over-year in Q3, and U.S. and Canada mobile application users grew 3% year-over-year, showing positive growth for the first time this year. So while our desktop and mobile web MAUs declined in Q3, our mobile app MAUs continued to show greater resilience. As a reminder, mobile application MAUs account for over 80% of our total impressions and revenue. Looking ahead, we've moved beyond the pandemic unwind. And by the end of the year, we will have lapped the Google Search algorithm update from November 2021 that had an impact on our ability to grow MAUs. We feel good about the health of the user base, and we're much more focused now on deepening engagement and driving revenue per user. Turning to our financial performance. Third quarter global revenue of $685 million grew 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 8% on a reported basis. Total U.S. and Canada revenue was $575 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This is an acceleration from last quarter's 7% growth rate. U.S. and Canada ARPU of $6.13 grew 15% year-over-year. Better-than-expected strength came from large U.S. retail advertisers who have been more resilient and often seek lower-funnel objectives and shopping goals. CPG advertiser revenue grew modestly year-over-year for the first time all year as we lapped the initial supply chain issues that these businesses faced this time last year. Our shopping ads revenue, which comes from promoted catalogs, grew 50% year-over-year, accelerating from the quarter prior. We're beginning to see traction in some of our emerging verticals like automotive, financial services and travel. These segments grew significantly faster than our overall revenue. And in general, we continue to evolve more from a previously experimental platform into an always-on and trusted advertising partner. Total revenue from Europe was $86 million, growing 8% on a constant currency basis but declining 4% on a reported basis due to significant foreign exchange headwinds. Our European advertisers remain concerned about the current recession impacting that region as inflation and energy costs are affecting consumer demand. Total revenue from our Rest of World region was $24 million, growing 41% on a constant currency basis and 36% on a reported basis. During the quarter, we launched advertisements in Argentina, Chile and Colombia as we added to our presence in the LatAm market. However, weak consumer spending created challenges for our more price-sensitive global mid-market and SMB advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we've been focused on building a durable performance advertising business that allows advertisers to meet users across the entire funnel. This has never been more important than today when CMOs are focused on marketing spend that drives measurable returns. In addition, our positive platform, our users' commercial intent and our ability to deliver insights-led selling drive unique value for advertisers that's just difficult to find elsewhere. In Q3, we expanded the Pinterest Trends tool from beta to general availability to help advertisers around the world get deeper insights into user planning behavior to inform the early campaign planning stage. Aligning with trends on Pinterest helps advertisers develop relevant campaigns that resonate with their audience based on real-time interests, leading to increased performance. In October, we announced that we've expanded the Pinterest Trends tool from the U.S., UK and Canada to 30 additional countries. For example, Ashley Furniture Canada tapped into growing home trends on Pinterest using our Pinterest Trends tool to align their products with emerging home decor styles. Knowing that terms like Boho chic and modern farmhouse were top home decor trends on Pinterest, they designed their campaign visuals to highlight how their products could bring these trends to life. In doing so, Ashley Furniture drove a 71% increase in click-through rates and a 12% increase in returns on ad spend in their conversion campaigns. We continue to innovate in tools and formats to improve automation. Our new API for conversions helps explain Pinterest's contribution to attributable conversions to advertisers. We're seeing encouraging adoption of the tool by our advertisers with its most frequent use case being lower-funnel actions such as checkouts. Beta results have shown impressive performance with a 30% -- 36% increase in attributed conversion volume when using both conversion API and tags compared to using tags only. Turning to our expense profile. Cost of revenue increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We're investing in models to make product experiences more personalized and relevant for our users while also delivering improved ROI for our advertisers. We're beginning to see impact from these investments in our current results and believe that they will continue to drive further improvements in engagement and revenue over time. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $434 million in the third quarter, up 38% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. This was lower than our prior guidance in part due to a decision to shift a portion of our brand marketing spend from the third to the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million in the third quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11%. We ended the quarter with about $2.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning to our preliminary outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to grow in the mid-single digits percentage range year-over-year. That includes approximately three percentage points of headwind from foreign exchange, slightly greater when compared to the third quarter. Many of our advertisers are navigating a challenging environment with higher inflation and weakening consumer demand. This creates a volatile demand environment globally. Given this uncertainty, we believe there could be a wider range of outcomes this quarter, including some downside risk, especially as our Q4 revenue tends to be back-end weighted. On expenses, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double digits percentage range sequentially as we shifted a portion of our brand marketing campaign into Q4. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to grow around 35% year-over-year, at the low end of the range we communicated at the start of the year. We firmly believe the investments we made this year will enable us to continue innovating to enhance both the user experience and our advertising platform. As we exit 2022, we're focused on maximizing the return from these investments. We are still committed to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill before we open it up to Q&A. No. I don't have much to add. I would say that, to Bill's point on starting to see the results, you saw it in the financial results with strength from many of our core customer base in large retail and even some falling in the CPG market for us. But it's also worth noting that in addition to the stability in the user base and even the sequential growth that we saw, Bill had referenced some sessions growth meaningfully above our user growth. We saw an improvement in saves, impressions, board creates in the U.S. and other good signals that we're now in a position to drive that ARPU story that Bill described. Colin, thanks for the question. I'll start with your first one on puts and takes around Q4 guidance. And then as you mentioned, Bill can speak to some of the lower-funnel work that we're doing. Currently, the headline is that October is trending, very roughly speaking, at the low end of our Q4 guidance of that guidance range that we described in the opening remarks. We've been executing very well in this environment overall and relative to others in the industry, which have been very encouraging. As you know, though, Q4 revenue is back-end weighted to November and December given holiday seasonal moments. And given this and the overall ad market volatility, there could be a wider range of outcomes, including some downside risk to our guidance. When we gave our Q3 guidance of mid-single digits growth during our Q2 earnings call in July, we indicated that July was trending slightly above that guide. And at this point, October today is trending at the low end of the Q4 guidance range, and our guide assumes a modest pickup in demand for November and December from today. It's also worth noting that our guide includes about three percentage points of headwind to revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter from foreign exchange headwinds, which is slightly greater when compared to the third quarter. Ross, thanks for the question. I think when you take a step back and you think about the user experience and the use cases that people come to Pinterest for, the mindset of our users, that same commercial intent and planning mindset that folks bring to Pinterest in the U.S., that's very similar in our non-U.S. markets, too. So similar use cases, generally similar demographics, which is a good starting point. We were just later to begin monetizing outside of the U.S., starting more in Western Europe and then moving to Latin America and then just launching in Japan a few months ago. So very early in general, but especially early in LatAm and in APAC. There are aspects of these markets that's a little unique. So for example, you may recall when we were talking about scaling in EMEA or Europe that we noted at the time that one of the differences in the market is more agency concentration or more agency-centric selling. And so we talked about launching business access as a tool to help us navigate the agency relationships there. So there are aspects of the product experience that need to be tweaked for these markets. But when you start with why do people come to Pinterest, what do they use it for, what is their mindset, the full-funnel experience that Bill described going from idea or intent to action and marrying that against advertiser objectives, it's very similar. And it's just a question of the depth of the ad market and the prices folks are willing to pay for those slots. Is that helpful? Thanks. Yeah. Rich, I mean, for sure, wanted to make sure -- I want to make sure folks understood that we're keenly aware of the environment we're operating in and what's happening in the industry. And I was hoping to call that out, the wider range of outcomes, the back-end-weighted nature of the quarter in general in Q4 for us and call out some of that risk and the wider range that may unfold. But this is our best call on where we're headed for the quarter. And I think what you can take away from that is we have a large concentration of larger retailer advertisers and large CPG advertisers that if you roll the clock back a couple of years when we were in the earlier days of the pandemic, those were the advertisers that were disproportionately slowed. And we looked relatively weak compared to the industry because we didn't have crypto, gaming apps, app download to the extent that others did. In this environment, we're seeing relative strength with those larger retailers. And with the falling in the CPG market, we saw more resilience there in the third quarter, and we're expecting some more resilience there in the fourth quarter.  The last thing I would say is that we had called out -- I made mention of it in words in my script around graduating from experimental to kind of always-on budgets. And we had talked about last quarter how our joint business partnership deal volume had grown in the first half of the year, 25% year-over-year. Those are non-contractual but indications of large advertiser spend commitments. We saw that number grow to 35% year-over-year -- year-to-date in terms of JVP deal volume, joint business partnership deal volume in the third quarter. So that gives us some indication that we are an important platform for advertisers that really need to reach consumers during a period when they're shopping.

And then lastly, we have seen that total deal volume dollars under those commitments grow now year-to-date 35% year-over-year, which is 10 points faster than what we were last quarter. So pretty good -- I think a lot of confidence with large sophisticated advertisers in the platform."

            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. I'm proud of our team's execution in Q3 across user growth, monetization and operating discipline. On the user side, we stabilized the user base and grew sequentially as we returned to seasonal growth trends. Our global revenues of $445 million were above Q3, 2021 as we've largely lapped headwinds from the pandemic unwind and have driven improvements and user engagement. Our U.S. and Canada miles grew sequentially for the first time since Q1 2021 to 95 million. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, they grew revenue by 10% on a constant currency basis to $685 million for Q3.  We delivered adjusted EBIT da of $77 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11%. Each of these points demonstrate that our team is operating with heightened focus and discipline, finding ways to grow the business and drive efficiencies despite the difficult macroeconomic environment.  My remarks today will focus on three topics. First, how we're making Pinterest more relevant and engaging. Second, how we're driving more inspiration to action, including greater shopability, and third, how we continue to improve our monetization efforts to drive value to our advertising partners.  By making Pinterest more relevant to our users, we can increase and deepen our engagement at the platform. We're doing this in multiple ways, including improving the personalization on our core surfaces, leveraging our unique opportunities of the content platform and broadening our appeal to emerging demographics effects.  On personalization, we're creating much more relevant experiences for users by combining the unique first party signal on our platform, with advancements in machine learning to recommend highly relevant content to users. In Q3, this work was a meaningful driver of our return to seasonal sequential growth and global and U.S. and Canada models.  It also resulted in year on year improvement in engagement, as measured by metrics such as sessions, impressions and SES. In fact, sessions in Q3 grew meaningfully faster than now's, which indicates that we are deepening engagement with our users. We believe growing sessions should drive multiple top-line benefits, such as reducing user churn, improving overall monetization and growing revenue per user.  We're also making Pinterest more relevant to users by leveraging our unique human curated content, and upgrading our overall content ecosystem. In short, we want to we want content that not only inspires users, but also helps them make do or buy things. With this goal in mind, here's how we're thinking about human curation and rich media content, which are the two biggest types of content we have on the platform.  The human curation at scale that happens on Pinterest is a highly differentiated invaluable source of content generated by our users. While machine learning helps us serve a personalized recommendation for a pair of women's fall boots, human curation at scale makes it possible for us to further suggest the best skirt and sweater options to complete the look, which we can do because those boots are ones like them have been saved as part of outfits on other boards on Pinterest.  This type of curation is very unique to Pinterest, and is fundamentally different user activity than what typically occurs on other platforms. This creates a highly efficient way to get relevant content for users across our ecosystem. User curated content is a key aspect of our content strategy, and we expect it to remain a significant differentiator. In addition, we're increasingly sourcing rich media content that is uploaded to our platform from a wide variety of sources, including publishers, creators, brands and users. And Q3 content uploaded to Pinterest accounted for nearly half of our saves, which demonstrates that users are finding this type of content highly relevant and engaging.  One of the uploaded rich media formats we're particularly excited about is video. Videos often make it easier for users to get inspired and to make do or buy something. This is especially true for Gen Z users. We've been ramping our video efforts over the past couple of years. Last year, we focused almost exclusively on attracting creators to upload videos on our platform.  However, we've since learned more about the types of videos that resonate with our users, and found that we can also obtain high quality videos, and other forms of rich media content from sources beyond creators. This is both highly efficient and effective. While creators are an important part of this equation, a larger portion of our rich media corpus is coming from users, brands and publishing partners like Tastemade, Refinery 29, Chef Club, Jelly Snack and [Indiscernible]. Over the past year as we've evolved our video upload tools, we've grown our video supply by 3x. Additionally, in October, we announced partnerships with Warner Music Group, Warner Chappell music, Merlyn and BMG to expand the music experience on Pinterest. Through these deals, users will be able to add popular song tracks through a new user experience, which we believe will enable users and creators to engage more deeply and creatively with the platform.  Finally, we're working to expand the relevance of our platform to emerging audiences, specifically Gen Z by building products and experiences that resonate with them. Over the past three years, growth from our global Gen Z demographic has outpaced growth from all other demos, and Gen Z users continue to grow despite the pandemic online, and SEO headwinds. In Q3, Gen Z grew double digits year over year, accelerating from Q2. This trend supports our thesis that Gen Z gets something on Pinterest that is distinct from what they get on other popular platforms, namely, a place to discover with intent and purpose and to explore their creativity.  Nowhere was this more clear to us in Q3 than in the enthusiastic reception of shuffles our standalone collage making app, which is available on an invite only basis to iOS users. The vast majority of shuffled users are in the Gen Z demo. And we've been watching with interest as they find novel ways to use shuffles such as remix each other shuffles to collaborate on ideas, like creating the perfect stranger things Halloween costume. We continue to iterate and learn from this beta launch, and plan to add new features and functionality to shuffle as we make it more widely available.  Next I'll discuss our approach to driving more inspiration and intent to action. At the highest level, we believe shopping on Pinterest drives and informs the core experience of the service rather than being distinct from or bolted on to that core experience. This is supported by the fact that more than half of users we've surveyed view Pinterest as a place to shop. Over time, we expect to make every product that the user encounters on Pinterest shoppable, even when that product may be in a scene or other user-generated content. This means pins on all our surfaces should be shoppable, not just the ones on a designated Shop tab. While we have computer vision capabilities, machine learning, human curation at scale and over 1 billion items in our product catalog, we also need to continue growing our product catalog to enable more of these shopping experiences. To that end, we released our API for shopping to general availability in Q3 across all of our shopping-enabled countries, which include the U.S. and our largest markets in Europe, Latin America and APAC. Our API for shopping makes it easier for merchants to upload their catalogs and metadata while also sending real-time data on SKU-level pricing and inventory. On the discoverability side, we're leveraging both machine learning and the first-party signals we get from the unique human curation on Pinterest. If you're looking for a mid-century modern couch, we should be able to show you tables, rugs and lamps to complete that room based on how millions of users have saved and organized home decor content. I think this is a superpower for us as we become the home for digital taste base shopping. Finally, we have an opportunity to become an even more trusted partner to retailers by helping send more traffic, attributable conversions and customers to their businesses. We can deliver high-quality shopping experiences in partnership with retailers by creating frictionless handoffs with the merchant for things that people want to buy. For example, we're piloting a hosted checkout program with Shopify that allows users to check out directly with the merchant while on Pinterest. We are also testing mobile deep linking that takes users straight to the retailer's app and checkout page.  Our efforts on personalization relevance and shopping are also instrumental in creating more value for advertisers. Pinterest is a unique place for advertisers because our users seek inspiration and discovery with intent and purpose. This has a number of implications. To begin with, we have on-platform, first-party signals like searches, saves and board curation that translate into highly valuable and monetizable customer insights for advertisers and resilient on-platform ad personalization and optimization.  In addition, we have full-funnel ad solutions as users come to us throughout the stages of their purchase journey. We've built our ad platform so advertisers can meet users at every stage of their purchasing journey, as they move from ideation, where brand advertising is most effective; to consideration, where a traffic campaign makes sense; to taking action, where conversion objectives are optimal. Revenue from our ads align with these three objectives with approximately one thirds of our revenue coming from each. Moreover, we're making ads more performant on Pinterest through insight-led selling, better automation and improved tools, measurement and formats. Our results show that this is working. Approximately 90% of our active advertisers now use automated bidding. And in Q3, our attributed conversions grew over 20% year-on-year driven by improvements we've made in ads optimization and conversion visibility. Before I hand over to Todd, I want to share my thoughts on how we operate the business. 2022 was a year of elevated investment for Pinterest as we leaned into a number of initiatives that we believe will drive durable, long-term growth. Additionally, the team and I have gone through an extensive review of our portfolio of initiatives to be sure we're focused on the highest-yielding activities. The benefits of that additional investment and heightened focus are coming through in product impact, particularly in engagement and revenue. We're also focused on driving efficiencies in the business. As we discussed on the last call, we intend to return to meaningful margin expansion next year and have already started those efforts. Lastly, we have a strong balance sheet with roughly $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our primary use of capital is to invest in the business to drive continued growth. In addition, Todd and I continue to evaluate our broader capital allocation strategy, including a plan to manage dilution from stock-based compensation. Now I'll turn it over to Todd to discuss our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Todd. I want to say a few words about how I approach these earnings updates because it's a bit different from how we've done things in the past. I consider communications with and feedback from investors a key priority. I view our quarterly earnings calls as one of the best channels to inform investors and analysts about the most important topics in the business, and I expect to increase the overall dialogue with our investors and analysts. And I look forward to sharing more with you when we set our Investor Day in 2023. Finally, I want to thank our team Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Thanks, Eric, for the question. So a couple of things I'd say. First of all, we've really been focused on bringing clarity, focus and operating discipline to the business. And on each of those, I'd say, on the clarity side, we're a visual discovery platform with three really unique attributes: first, that we're a positive place on the Internet; second, that our users come here with high intent. So while we're a discovery platform, users have intent, which is quite different from other platforms; and then third, the human curation that happens on our platform is quite unique. And so with that clarity, we're really focused on things that can drive differentiation based on those unique attributes of our platform and making sure that we're operating well and tying these initiatives across our different functions and making sure that we're focused on the highest-yielding activities. As we go into '23, we're glad that we've stabilized the user base and returned to seasonal growth on users. And we think we've got a great ARPU story as we continue to move forward with the business. We're driving more relevance with users, and we're doing that really by leaning into these unique attributes of the platform, both in terms of how we take inspiration to action with things like shopping, making more of the content that users find on Pinterest actionable and bringing more relevant content to users, particularly content that is coming from efficient sources like user-generated content on our platform as well as what we can do with publishers and then, of course, creators also. And then finally, innovation on ad tech, where we've been making really good progress on what we're doing on the ad tech side, but we think there's a lot more that we can do there. So again, I think you're seeing some of this reflected in the results this quarter, but we think there's a lot of upside yet to go on each of those points. I'll pause. Is there anything, Todd, do you want to add to that? Yeah. And on your questions on lower funnel and shopping, Colin, we think there's a lot more we can do to drive intent to action across the platform. This is one of the things we think makes us very different than other discovery platform is that we have discovery with intent and purpose. And so there's a lot more that we can do to drive that intent to action. Shopping is a particular area of focus for us on that. On the strategy there, what we're really doing is looking to go meet the user where they are on the platform. We see that more than half of users on Pinterest are here to shop. They're telling us that directly. And we've had experiments with things like shopping tabs that have been sort of a part of the experience but not necessarily been core to the experience. Moving forward, we're making shopping more core to the experience. That's what users are looking for from Pinterest already. So we're quite confident in that meeting a real user need. And you can see progress on the shopping front already. For example, our Q3 revenue from shopping ads grew 50% year-on-year. So that's a good indication of the progress there. And the things you can look to see more from us, as I mentioned in my comments, starting to make every product you encounter on Pinterest shoppable regardless whether that product appeared in a scene or user-generated content. And then taking the discovery that's happening on Pinterest and making sure that for all that great discovery of products that users are finding on Pinterest, they have a clear way to take action on that, which has not always been the case historically. So going forward, we want to make sure there's much more actionability on that. And that actionability can be a hosted checkout like what we're doing with Shopify, where the user still is checking out directly with the merchant, but they're doing it in context on our platform or it can be a high-quality handoff to the retailer or the merchant like with the mobile deep link that gives the user a seamless connection with where to buy. And as we do that, we think that not only can address a lot of leaked engagement on our platform because historically, since the actionability was less, users would find things on Pinterest and then oftentimes have to go search someplace else to find where to buy them. As we give the user more actionability, we think that not only plugs leaked engagement from the platform, brings engagement back to -- deep engagement on our platform, it's also a very highly monetizable event as well. And you're already seeing that progress in our shopping ads, and we expect more of that to continue. Next question, operator. Thanks for the questions, Mark. First on the music partnerships, we look at that really as a way to make our content more attractive for users. You've seen us making good progress on that, particularly in finding efficient ways to source new content. If you look at where we had been, it was almost entirely focused on creators.  We now look at creators as a part of that strategy, but there's a broader strategy on content and is looking at all the sources of content, including from publishers and partners. And this is an example of a partner. So I view this more in our broader content strategy and how we're getting more refined on the kinds of content that resonate with our users, which tend to be content that helps users satisfy intent and has a purpose and the fact that we're broadening out our sources of content for that, which generally should lead to better monetization opportunities overall over time. On your machine learning question, it's a fantastic question. And one of the things that I found quite compelling about Pinterest as part of why I joined is that machine learning is a utility that many have access to. Machine learning, though, is only as good as the signal that it's acting upon. And the human curation that happens on Pinterest, I think, is fundamentally different than the user engagement that happens on other platforms. Most of the other platforms in the discovery arena tend to be lean-back consumption platforms. And I think this is why you see as platforms like Apple have implemented privacy changes and diminish the ability to use signals like third-party cookies. And you're seeing that have different impacts on different platforms. In a platform like Pinterest that has user intent on the platform, you're seeing that stand out. You're seeing that be more resilient and being able to show relevant things to users.  But the human curation on our platform, the fact that users come to Pinterest and tell us what types of outfits go together, what types of home decor go together, what kind of decorations go together well, that is really rich signal that our machine learning can act upon. That is fundamentally different than the signal that you would get on a lean back consumption platform where your signals primarily views versus here, we have the user lean forward, engaging, curating, creating, making these associations directly on our platform. And we think that's a very powerful signal that is feeding our machine learning and where we think we can continue to make really great advances and relevance and really outpace what we think is happening in a lot of the rest of the visual discovery arena where there's a lack of intent -- or tends to be a lack of intent. And so it's a place where you're seeing that in our user engagement results already and some of the improvements there. But we think that's something where we have a lot of future potential to continue. All right. Thanks for the question. I'll start there and then give it to Todd to fill in some more on it. International, we definitely think there's opportunity there. You see good growth from us in some of the markets, and Todd will talk more about that. What I would say generally on shopping is we -- the thing that we believe makes us very different than other platforms, which I talked about around the intent on our platform, the human curation on our platform that gives us much richer signal than you would find in a lot of other visual discovery platforms, I think puts us in a really great position to solve the full funnel for shopping. We're a full-funnel platform, and I think you see that resonating with advertisers on our platform. And we've historically been stronger in upper and mid. We're doing more in lower funnel. So I think we're uniquely positioned across markets to address that full funnel. In a lot of ways, the first 20-plus years of e-commerce were solving for buying and not as much for the shopping part of the equation, which was sort of walking a bazaar, going into the mall and not knowing what you wanted to buy but having a general sense and then discovering. That hasn't been fully solved in the digital world. And I think -- what you see from us around our ability to create great visual exploration with really great recommendations and really rich first-party signal lets us go solve that full fundamental experience in the digital world in a way that just has not been fully solved as of yet. I think that's our primary differentiator, and it cuts across markets. And there may be things that are specific to different markets that we may tune to in one market or the next. But I think that differentiation in tying that full funnel together, I believe, is quite unique in e-commerce generally and cuts across markets. At the same time, we are managing to grow in international markets. We launched shopping last year in the EU. So it's relatively new, but we're seeing it grow well. And maybe I'll hand off to Todd there to talk about the various efforts across the markets there. Thanks, Brian. Great questions. So on the session growth, yes, we were feeling good about the progress there, indicating that we're deeply engaging with our users and we think highlights the opportunity for us to continue to drive ARPU growth, which we think of as even more important than MAU growth going forward given the opportunity to do more to bring those users from episodic usage to more frequent usage. Answer on your question, we -- search is a part of what you come to the platform for. And if you look at the upper, mid- and lower funnel, and I touched on this in the comments, our revenue is split roughly third, third, third across those stages of the funnel. I'd say that lower funnel is the place where the product is even more nascent. So even though we see considerable search volume on the platform today, the fact that we do have such high intent and so many people are here to shop, we do think that lower funnel is a place that we can strengthen more and more shopping is a key part of that. And so to your second question around accelerating efforts to bring those merchants on -- so we've had good integrations with Shopify. I talked about the shopping API that we put out that really makes it much easier for merchants to go publish our catalog to us. We're at 1 billion items in the catalog now. We think there's billions more that we can add to that. And so having an API that retailers can use to not only publish our catalogs to us but also give real-time updates on inventory and pricing, we think will really help that. But then the other part of that, that is really important, and I mentioned this earlier, is shifting from shopping being a separate tab or a separate activity or a thing that a user has to seek out on the platform versus meeting the user where they are in making the products that they encounter naturally on the platform naturally shoppable. And so as we do more and more of that, we think that will really create a lot more opportunity to drive that lower-funnel activity, and search is a part of that. But really, it's the visual discovery journey and the fact that we know we have users here with intent and making that intent much more easily actionable, we think, is the broader opportunity for us. And again, you see progress on it from us already with the shopping ads growing 50% year-on-year. But we're still relatively early days there, and so we're excited. There's a lot to go. Thanks, Brian. All right. Thanks, Rich. I'll start with a couple of thoughts on your question on the macro and then give it to Todd to fill in there. If you look at this quarter, I think you look at us relative to our peer set. And I think it's pretty clear that in a tough macro, we found ways to differentiate and outpace a decelerating ad market. And yes, as we go into Q4, you're seeing projections from others, there's a lot of expectations around that, that will continue to decelerate. At the same time, we think there's a lot that we're doing that is cutting through. But Todd talked about the wider rain around the outcomes is an inherently back-weighted quarter with holiday shopping, and holiday shopping is something people spend a lot of time on Pinterest for holiday activities, not just shopping, but things like how they think about their decor, how do they think about planning for events, how do they think about recipes and all these kinds of things that really drive a lot of engagement during Q4. But as Todd mentioned, it's a back-weighted quarter. And so that's why there's a wider range around that.  I'll pause and let Todd add into that before I come to the second part of your question. On your second question, Rich, you asked me for one thing that we cut through the most. I'll give you two, but they're related. So the first I've talked about a bunch, which is driving more of the intent to action. We know the user has strong intent here, but we haven't always made it as easy as it could be for them to take action on that. So we think as we make more of the things people are discovering on Pinterest directly actionable, we think there's a lot of lift in engagement that comes from that. But the same thing that's related to it is our ad platform is younger than many of the other platforms out there. And so you're seeing us make advancements in maturing the platform. As we drive greater maturity in our ad platform, there's a lot of upside in delivering more insight, more measurability to our advertising partners. And again, I think you see some of that reflected in our results with conversion year-on-year being up 20%, us giving more tools to advertisers and insights around these things.  As we make that more and more mature, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity on that as well. And obviously, these two things relate to one another because that intent to action really rounds out the lower-funnel part of our story, making us a truly unique full-funnel platform that can engage with the user across every stage of their purchasing journey. So those are the two very related things, I would say, I think, have the most opportunity to really cut through and drive continued improvement for us as we go into next year. Operator next question. Yeah. Maybe I'll take the second one first and then give it to Todd on your first question. On the video side, I would say, each of those deals are -- I would not expect to have a material impact on margin or things like that. The macro point to take away is as we have refined our content strategy, we're finding efficient ways to go get really high-quality content that resonates with our users. So while the teams have been experimenting with short-form video for a couple of years now, there's a lot of good learnings there around the type of video content that resonates with users on Pinterest, which is oftentimes different than the video content that may resonate for those users or -- resonating for users on other platforms because users have more intent and purpose here. It's less about entertainment, and it's more about intent and purpose, which means there are often different kinds of videos that are resonant. And so finding partnerships to source those is quite efficient as compared to creator ecosystem. Again, creators are an important part of that strategy. But whereas they were most of the strategy previously. They're now a part of that strategy. And I look at these third-party partnerships as broadening out the content strategy, broadening our sources in a way that is more efficient than what you would have seen in a content -- or a creator-only content strategy. So while these deals specifically don't have some sort of negative impact to margin, I think on our longer-term strategy, you're seeing us focus on efficient ways to source content both of these third-party deals. And then I'd finally call out the creation and curation that happens on our platform is really important content as well. I've talked several times about the value of the human curation on our platform. That curation is content creation, and it's a lot of the content that our users are seeking as they're trying to put together an outfit or put together a room or put together a holiday party. The pins that come onto our platform, the board is the people curing on our platform are giving a lot of that content that we really need to service. So that's really efficient content sourcing as well. And I'll turn it over to Todd for the other part of your question. Operator we'll take our last question. Thanks, Doug. On the ad innovation side, as I mentioned, like we're early on in our ad -- relatively early on in our ad platform compared to others. And I think some of the things we've talked about in terms of better conversion visibility, better trends visibility, the adoption of automation by our advertising partners, these are all things we think there's a lot of continued yield. Self-serve is an opportunity for us. We're probably even more nascent in our self-serve capabilities. So longer term, I'd say there's a large opportunity for us. I'd say in the near term, a lot of those smaller advertisers that would be more inclined towards self-serve have been some of the hardest impacted. And so fortunately, that's a smaller part of our business. It's one that we still very much believe in over the long term. But our focus is on building out the maturity of the ad platform more broadly right now. And then self-serve, we'll continue to invest there, but we view it as smaller in the near term, but it's still quite important in the long term.  And then on the Shuffles side, yes, Shuffles has seen really phenomenal reception. And I think it really speaks to interesting use cases that people expect on Pinterest. The user is just in a different mode on Pinterest than they are on other platforms. I talked about the users in a lean-forward mode on Pinterest versus a lean-back mode on other platforms. And it's very hard to change the sort of headspace the user's in when they're in an app or on a platform. So the fact we have user in that lean-forward mode, I think Shuffles is just one example of the way that we can extend use cases with our users that are uniquely Pinterest, take advantage of the lean-forward mode that you just have with us. And then to your question on Gen Z, I want to be clear, and I think I touched on this in my comments, our Gen Z traction is not just about Shuffles. We're finding really great Gen Z traction in the core platform already. So I cited some of those stats around the growth there in my prepared remarks. Shuffles we think only adds to that. And to your question, we are looking at ways we can draw more connectivity between Shuffles and the Pinterest app. So it's already the case that when you're in Shuffles, you can connect your Pinterest boards and these kinds of things. So there's connections between these two already. And we think there's more and more of these natural connections that can happen between the two so that each is enhancing the other. All right. Thank you again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. And as I mentioned earlier, we really look forward to keeping this dialogue going with all of you. We appreciate your feedback, and enjoy the rest of your day."

And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Thanks, Neil, and hi, everyone. Appreciate you joining our call. Today is going to be a bit different. In addition to announcing results, we're also marking an exciting new chapter for Pinterest. A few weeks ago, we welcomed our new CEO, Bill Ready. Today, you're going to hear from him and see why we're all excited to have him at the helm. But before I turn it over to him and Todd, I just want to quickly touch on why we made the transition. First, I absolutely love Pinterest and cherish the journey we've been on for more than a decade. It all began in 2010 as a tool to help people collect all the things they love from across the Internet. And in the years since, Pinterest has grown into something bigger and more meaningful. Today, Pinterest is a place where 433 million people all over the world come to get inspiration, a place where content creators can share their talents and passions with an inspired global audience and a place where brands can connect with consumers trying to build their best lives. I am grateful to everyone who's made this journey possible; first, our Pinners, our extraordinarily talented team and all of the investors and businesses who've supported us along the way. I'm proud of what we've achieved together. But as far as we've come, I know Pinterest could be more. It's so clear that we have an opportunity to build an end-to-end platform, one that delights people with incredible inspiration, helps them plan their futures and then bring those plans to life with purchases and actions. It's an ambitious vision that's bigger than one person, including a founder. And so, for our next stage of growth, we sought a leader with expertise in e-commerce and shopping to help us capitalize on the strong user intent and planning behavior on our platform. I met and talked with a lot of people. Bill's skill set and experience stood out. He's a builder who scaled companies like Braintree and Venmo. He knows how to operate a global scale from his time as CEO of PayPal. He's a leader in commerce, most recently as President of Commerce, Payments and Next Billion Users of Google. And beyond his resume, he shares our values and our aspiration of building a positive corner of the Internet that's nourishing and encouraging. His passion is the same as ours, creating products that people love. It became clear to me that Bill will be a fantastic CEO for Pinterest next chapter, and the Board felt the same way after discussions with them and that's why we made the move. I could not be more excited about where Bill is going to lead Pinterest in the future. I know there's a huge opportunity ahead of us. I'm looking forward to fully supporting Bill's vision and strategy, and I can't wait to see how he leads us into the next great chapter of our story. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to share a few thoughts. Bill?\nBill Ready: Thank you, Ben and hello everyone. I first want to express my gratitude to Ben and the Board for their trust in me as Pinterest CEO. As a fellow entrepreneur, I have tremendous respect for Ben and what he's accomplished at Pinterest. Under Ben's leadership, Pinterest has grown into a global consumer Internet platform with hundreds of millions of users, has scaled revenue to over $2 billion, and the Pinterest brand is synonymous with positivity. It's been roughly a month since I became CEO. And after talking with some of our key stakeholders and reviewing our product roadmap, I'm even more excited today about our business opportunity ahead. I know that maintaining a healthy dialogue and relationship with the investor community is an important part of our success. That's why I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing why I joined Pinterest and outlining what you can expect in the next few months. I joined Pinterest because it offers people a digital experience that is genuinely unique and positive and because we've only just begun to tap into the possibilities that experience has to create value for users and advertisers. Pinterest is really one of the only platforms that sits at the intersection of social media, search and e-commerce. And I'm incredibly excited to help unlock the company's potential. Having spent most of my career in commerce and payments, I recognize that there are many places to buy online, but there are very few online destinations where you can actually shop, that is to browse and discover and get inspired before you buy.  Pinterest is very unique, and it has inspiration, discovery, and strong user intent, all in the same place. Pinterest is one of the few places online where users can discover new products by browsing and searching in a curated, personalized setting before they even know exactly what they want. What happens next is similarly unique. Pinterest don't just scroll through or like images. They save relevant pins to thematic boards. This active saving content again shows how differentiated the Pinner mindset is. You save something because you plan to return and take action on it. This type of engagement is a highly differentiated first-party signal we can leverage to create value for Pinners and advertisers alike. It allows Pinterest to better leverage organic engagement activity and makes the platform less vulnerable to certain ongoing changes in the broader technology landscape. From my perspective, we have an enormous opportunity to lean further into the significant intent and first-party signal that we have on the platform to help users bring the ideas and inspiration they found on Pinterest to life. At the same time, I believe that Pinterest's unique use case appeals to advertisers of all shapes and sizes, and gives advertisers the opportunity to engage a crucial and highly valuable moments in the user's purchase journey when the user has clear intent, but is still determining what to buy. Longer term, this unique combination of inspiration and intent can be applied to many categories and I'm excited to help broaden and diversify the base of advertisers by making the platform easier to use. And we have a fantastic team to capitalize on these opportunities. I've been very impressed with the people at Pinterest and their commitment and enthusiasm for our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We truly live our mission. Over the next few months, I'll be digging deeper into our product strategy, on engagement and content as well as on the planning and shopping side. I'll be meeting with more of our key stakeholders, including Pinners, our employees, advertisers and agencies, strategic business partners and our shareholders to understand their needs. And I'm going to work with our leadership team on how we can update a durable long-term strategy to deliver value across the board. I recognize that there is a lot of work ahead of us, especially during a period of significant macroeconomic headwinds and general consumer uncertainty, but we're operating today from a position of strength, with a growing business that is differentiated in the market and offers a distinct value proposition to advertisers that Todd will address further in his remarks. Pinterest is a business that has generated attractive margins and cash flow, and is in an incredibly sound financial position with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Given the strength of our financial position today, I'm also focused on evaluating the best uses of capital for Pinterest, and we'll be considering this as we update our broader strategic plan, which we'll share more of in the coming months. Additionally, I'm reviewing our investment profile to understand the return on investment of our expenses and to determine the best way to optimize in a resource-constrained environment. Given the growth that we are seeing, combined with the significant potential opportunity ahead of us, we are continuing to invest in the business this year, and Todd will give more detail on that. But it's worth saying that I do not subscribe to a growth at all cost mentality. While I believe we need to invest in long-term growth, I also believe that constraints breed creativity and can lead to even better product outcomes. And we have an extremely creative team here. So while 2022 is an investment year, I'll be focused on aligning our investments with our objectives of creating a differentiated experience for our users, helping our existing and new advertisers achieve success on our platform, and generating attractive returns on our investments for shareholders. Consistent with that, Todd and I agree that Pinterest plans to return to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. I look forward to communicating more about our plans in the coming months. Now, I'll turn it over to Todd to talk about the quarter.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Bill. I'd like to share some further details on the trends we saw in Q2 and provide a preliminary update for Q3. Before I jump into the quarter, a quick review of our principles. As Bill mentioned, Pinterest is uniquely valuable for consumers because it helps them discover new ideas and then bring those ideas to life often through purchases. But the full funnel journey that consumers take on Pinterest from demand inception through product consideration to conversion means that Pinterest offers differentiated value for a wide range of advertisers, too. And the ways in which they engage with Pinterest are quite distinct from social media companies. This is due to our users' unique mindset. They tend to be in-market consumers with high commercial intent. Initially, our service attracted mostly larger retail and consumer packaged goods or CPG advertisers who wanted to be discovered by our user base and recognize the value of the fact that well over 90% of Pinner queries were unbranded and still are today. These advertisers remain an important part of our business and make Pinterest's advertiser composition a fair bit different than many other online advertising platforms. But we've also built a significant performance advertising business over the past several years that has helped marketers leverage the organic commercial intent on Pinterest to drive conversions, often additions to a cart, checkouts or purchases. The advertisers who reliably find strong returns on Pinterest are those who value our unique offering, including our differentiated and highly attractive user demographic, the high commercial intent that I just described, a relatively brand-safe environment, insights-led media buying and longer attribution windows that reflect the value of advertising at the inception of actual demand when the value of advertising is arguably higher than later in a purchase decision. To that end and despite challenging macro conditions, we saw resilience from our large advertising partners, with 25% growth in spend commitments from joint business partnerships in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. As a reminder, these joint business partnerships, while nonbinding, are indications of sizable spend commitments from larger advertisers who often view Pinterest as an important channel to reach their consumers. These partnerships often suggest that we are an established channel for those partners rather than an experimental platform. Furthermore, we're focused on expanding our monetization to new geographies, and it's beginning to drive results. While we had 223 million monthly active users in our Rest of World segment, our revenue in Rest of World in Q2 was just $22 million. However, our Rest of World ARPU increased by 80% year-over-year. In line with this strategy, we launched ads in Japan in the second quarter. And in July, we expanded into Chile, Argentina and Colombia. And we're excited to monetize our emerging markets. On a year-over-year basis, our monthly active users declined 5%. Some of the factors contributing to our year-over-year MAU decline are easier to quantify such as lower search traffic, largely driven by Google's algorithm change in November of last year, which resulted in fewer new users and resurrections, and the last vestiges of the pandemic unwind, which we believe we largely lapped at the end of Q2. We do also face increasing competition for time spent on competitive video-centric platforms, primarily in our mature markets, but it's challenging to quantify or measure the impact to our engagement on these platforms. These year-over-year declines were most pronounced for our web users, which dropped approximately 30% year-over-year, while our global mobile app users remain far more resilient, growing 8% year-over-year. It's worth noting that in the US and Canada, our mobile app users were flat sequentially, which was a particularly positive signal during our seasonally weakest quarter of the year for engagement. It's important to note that our global mobile app users represent well over 80% of our revenue and our impressions. So resilience with mobile app users is an important signal for financial performance and capacity. Turning to our financial performance. Q2 revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $666 million or 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, our revenue grew 16%. On a two-year basis, revenue accelerated at an annualized rate of 56% in the second quarter compared to 45% growth in the first quarter. In Europe, our revenue grew 22% year-over-year when adjusting for the 12-point headwind due to the strength of the US dollar. On the demand side, the digital advertising environment has been and will continue to be challenging. While we saw strength from retail and international advertisers, we experienced softer demand from CPG, big-box retailers and our mid-market advertisers. Despite these headwinds, shopping ads continue to make progress on the platform. In Q2, shopping ads revenue grew twice as fast as overall revenue year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $92 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16% sequentially. We thoughtfully designed a plan to invest during the course of 2022. In the first half of the year, we invested heavily and made key hires to augment the organization, which we believe will drive growth in the long term. Also for context in the first quarter, we spent less than we originally anticipated due to slower-than-expected hiring in R&D and a delay in our creator-related marketing spend. In the second quarter, we saw an opportunity to augment our R&D team as the recruiting market became more favorable and our recruiting execution improved.  Also, we caught up on some originally planned creator-related marketing. In addition, our G&A expenses increased sequentially, with headcount growth and related payroll spend in our human resources and recruiting teams being the largest contributor. Roughly 1/4 of the sequential increase in expense we expect to be nonrecurring at these levels. Finally, our employees returning to office in the second quarter as COVID protocols changed drove some costs, including an increase in facilities and travel and entertainment-related costs. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q3. I'd like to first touch on monthly active users. As we mentioned last quarter, we're either providing users, nor an intra-quarter update. But I'd like to offer some additional context on how we're thinking about engagement in the back half of this year. With the pandemic unwind largely behind us, we believe that global monthly active users will return to more seasonal -- more typical seasonal engagement patterns in the second half of the year. Those seasonal patterns typically show modest sequential growth as we move to Q3 and Q4. However, these trends may be a bit more muted than they have been historically and for the US, Canada and Europe specifically, we hope to stabilize our user base in the back half of the year. While the pandemic unwind is largely behind us, we face increasing and sustained competition from video-centric apps for users' share of time spent. And as always, this color assumes that we don't face any incremental exogenous engagement headwinds like further search algorithm changes. I'll now turn to revenue guidance. Given the dynamic nature of the economy today and how quickly conditions can improve or worsen, we thought it would be prudent to provide a fairly broad range rather than providing a point estimate like last quarter. We currently expect Q3 revenue to grow in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year percentage basis. We're growing slightly faster quarter-to-date, but many of our advertising partners, especially larger retailers are experiencing supply chain issues, inflation and weakening consumer demand. These conditions are weighing on advertisers' ability to spend and our best signals of future performance suggests a slowdown from the growth rate we saw in July. This anticipated slowdown will likely land us toward the lower end of our guidance range. Moreover, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we could end up with revenue growth at the bottom end of the range or below in the low single digits. Please note that in addition to the challenging economic environment, our Q3 revenue guide of mid-single digits reflects a few other considerations. First, we anticipate slightly greater foreign exchange headwinds when compared to Q2. Second, we continue to monitor the impact of higher CPAs as a result of platform-specific dynamics and our engagement trends. We believe higher pricing may disproportionately affect price-sensitive advertisers' ability to utilize their budgets on our platform. That said, we continue to believe that advertisers who value the things I discussed earlier, that make Pinterest unique, will continue to find success on our platform. Third, Idea Pin distribution will have a modest low single-digit impact to revenue growth in Q3. And as we lap this, we do not believe Idea Pins will be a further meaningful headwind to revenue in Q4 and beyond. Finally, I want to discuss our expense guide and our philosophy around investments. As Bill discussed, we're living in a more uncertain environment marked by slower revenue growth and greater demand volatility. While our business has proven relatively resilient, we're conscious of the economic climate. So far, we've meaningfully slowed the pace of hiring, as we reevaluate our needs for the second half of this year and how best to support our plans for longer-term growth. We will be even more strategic and selective in our hiring plans for the remainder of 2022. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double digits quarter-over-quarter due to our global brand marketing campaign that we intend to launch in mid-September and run through late October, continued investments in our native content and creator efforts and the impact of our recent hiring. We believe that investments in marketing, especially for our mature and newly monetizing markets, can build on and amplify the progress we're making in our core engagement work, and we believe these investments could yield strong returns in the future. For the full year, there\u2019s no change to our previous guide of non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the range of 35% to 40% year-over-year, with a continued deceleration in sequential expense growth from the second quarter's peak levels. As we said at the start of this year, after three consecutive years of significant margin expansion, we view 2022 as the right time to accelerate investments to better position ourselves to capitalize on our long-term growth potential. We still believe that this is the right approach. But given the increasingly dynamic market environment and with Bill joining the company, we are evaluating our investment profile for the second half of this year and beyond. While there is a significant long-term runway ahead for the business, we have accelerated much of our desired investments into 2022 and believe that we will start to see the benefits of those investments next year. As such, we plan to return to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. As you know, we've long been focused on achieving the appropriate balance between realizing our long-term potential and delivering near-term financial results. We have approximately $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and Bill and I are discussing how we should be allocating our capital. In Q2, we acquired THE YES, which reinforces our commitment to connecting the commercial intent on our platform with personalized shopping experiences. We'll continue to be thoughtful and strategic about our deployment of cash with respect to future M&A. Bill and I are committed to delivering value for shareholders and will discuss our longer-term strategic framework with you going forward. Thanks to our employees at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration, plan and shop. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill for a brief comment before we open it up to questions.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Todd. Before we move to Q&A, I want to address recent news reports regarding a large investment from Elliott Management. We've had a very collaborative and engaged dialogue with Elliott recently. They're aligned with our vision on what Pinterest can become, are supportive of our team and our efforts and see the same tremendous potential for long-term value creation that I do. I look forward to continuing to engage with Elliott as I will with our other shareholders and view their investment as a vote of confidence in Pinterest's future. But the purpose of today's call is to discuss our second quarter results and outlook, and we ask that you please keep your questions focused on these topics. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions and Ben, I just first want to thank you for all the dialogue on these earnings calls since going public. Bill, maybe turning to you. Maybe two-parter, if I can. First, when you were approaching this role from the outside in, what are you the most excited about in terms of closing the gap from executing on the operation side against the opportunity set versus how you're thinking about allocating capital investments against that ambition? And then the second part of the question would be, when you say meaningful margin expansion in 2023, help us bridge from all the ambition you're laying out and what you want to invest in to the concept of expanding margins in 2023 past this investment year? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Excellent. Thank you for the question. So, quite a number of things I was excited about in joining Pinterest. But I think to a specific element of your question around how we drive forward on commercial engagement and these types of opportunities. As I mentioned a bit in my comments, I think Pinterest is in this very unique place of being at the intersection between social and search and having a very high amount of intent on the platform paired with inspiration. So, I think these things of when you think about what are the places you can go to find inspiration and discovery, oftentimes, those don't necessarily have intent built in with those, places that may have high intent don't necessarily have inspiration and discovery and Pinterest has both of those things. And I think that gives us a really unique opportunity to take users from this inspiration and discovery and the intent that they have on our platform and drive that through to realization, whether that is making or doing or buying. And I think we're really at the very beginning of what the platform can deliver there. But the thing that I was really excited about and continue to be really excited about now that I'm on the inside, as I look at the way that users are naturally engaging with the platform, it's a much harder problem to try to shift the way a user behaves. To help a user do a thing they already want to do is a much easier problem to solve, and that's something that we see on Pinterest that user are coming here with a clear intent -- yes, to hear for inspiration and discovery, they have a clear intent and driving that further to action, again, whether that's shopping, buying, making or doing, we think there's huge potential there. And there's some good early signs of that as we look at what's happening with shopping ads and some of the things there. And maybe I'll turn it over to Todd to expand further on some of the shopping progress as well as touch on your question around margins.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, a couple of things. I mean, obviously, we're all very excited to move forward on the vision that Bill is starting to lay out here. But on the shopping question, in particular, you might remember back over the last couple of calls that we've been very focused on making sure we have a lot of shoppable inventory and then we have the right shoppable services for people to discover those products. And so a lot of our effort has come through building an inventory of shopping products that we can map to commercial intent and our users' preferences. We're now to one billion shoppable products in the system. And on the shoppable surfaces side, we launched Your Shop, which is our first personalized shopping experience. That will be augmented by the acquisition we made with YES and help our users continue to go from intent to action on the platform. So really excited about those two things. And on top of that, we're building, as I mentioned in my script, our shopping revenue is growing twice the rate of our overall revenue. So really compelling vision financially behind what Bill was describing. The second part of your question was around the expense profile and what we meant by meaningful margin expansion, I think, if I heard your question correctly. And I think the tee up here is, number one, the business has a ton of runway. Everything Bill described suggests that we've got a big business to build here. And in the spirit of that, we laid out 2022, a couple of calls ago as an investment year after several years of significant margin expansion leading into 2022. But this isn't a new normal, or it's just a year where we designed to position the company for an improved user experience, future compelling revenue growth and margin expansion in the years to come. And so I've had questions about whether next year will be another reset or another investment year. But as you heard Bill described, while we're still spending a lot of time together to figure out what that plan is, and this is way too early to provide guidance for next year, we're looking at the macro environment, we\u2019re getting together as a team to figure out what our product plans will be for next year. So it's not guidance. But the idea here is that we would see as much as couple hundred basis points of margin expansion going into next year, just to provide some directional input.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Certainly. Next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Bill, just one for you and then, Todd, maybe one for you on the quarter. But strategically, Bill, Google Shopping went through a long metamorphosis from the frugal to where you left it, which was in much better shape than those early years. So I guess what parts of the Google playbook might be applicable here that you had done in your time there? And how would you rank the plumbing that Pinterest has compared to, obviously, the really good plumbing -- that technical plumbing that Google had or has had all along? And then, Todd, maybe just on the quarter, you talked about larger online retail advertisers showing a lot of strength and big-box retail and CPG and others having more issues, which I think makes a lot of sense given what we've heard from Walmart and others here through last week. So could you just flesh out a little bit more on are you adding new online retail advertisers to the top? Are you gaining wallet share within those larger online retail advertisers? I think we understand who's weak, but I'd love to hear more about where that strength is coming from? Thanks a lot.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thank you for the question, and I appreciate the sentiment. So I'll keep my comments focused on the opportunity here, but definitely a lot of things from time spent in the industry that drew me to Pinterest and then I think speak to the uniqueness of the opportunity here. So a couple of those that I would mention. One, when you think about what it takes to create a really great personalized and curated visual experience, you really need a lot of deep capabilities in computer vision, machine learning, AI. And those things, as you can imagine, are nontrivial to create. And even before Pinterest -- before joining Pinterest, I really had a tremendous amount of respect for what the team here had done in creating a great visual experience, leveraging a lot of computer vision and driving really good personalization through ML and AI. And I'd say now on the inside, I'm even more excited by those things. And so when I think about how we go forward on the shopping opportunities here, I think that's a really tremendous area of strength for Pinterest, is leveraging those deep capabilities in computer vision and the visual nature of how people naturally explore a shopping journey and a really good ML and AI to personalize those what's really relevant for the specific user. And then you see some things that the team here has already been working on that we can do a lot more with like partnering with other platforms in the ecosystem, making it easier to ingest inventory from those platforms and from retailers, so there's an even more rich catalog of products available for consumers to take action on. So I think there's a number of those things that I can see from the outside that I thought were quite compelling. And now on the inside, I find even more compelling. But obviously, a lot more that we can do there. And so that's quite exciting as well. But I still think that we're very early innings on that. But again, solving things that the user, I believe, expects from Pinterest, and that's a great place to be when you're solving things that a user naturally expects from your platform.\nBill Ready: And Ross, to your -- the second part of your question on the retailer point, more larger specialty retailers and larger e-commerce versus big box, I think you're spot on in your comments about what you're seeing in real time in the news and what others reports. Our larger specialty retailers and larger e-commerce were more resilient on the platform. The diversified big-box retailers were under a bit more pressure, just probably unsurprising given the demand environment and consumer spend. But the overall message is kind of where I started my opening comments. For advertisers that value the demographic mix of our users, that value the brand safety of the platform, that value the insights-led media buying that we're providing, and we've only enhanced that. It used to be a little bit more manual, and now we have automation around how these insights to design campaigns, and the value of being earlier in a purchase decision by communicating the value of a longer attribution window, those advertisers are finding success despite the environment and are scaling their spend. So to your point on, are we adding more, or are we getting more share of wallet, I would say it's both. And with that probably have your component of share of wallet versus adding a lot of mill advertisers in those particular segments.\nNeil Doshi: Great. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. Bill, one for you. You\u2019ve said, you've been around the industry over a long time. You have a very unique perspective. You've obviously studied Pinterest inside the competitive landscape. A lot of what you described as the opportunity isn't that new probably to a lot of people on this call. I would be curious to hear about sort of two or three low-hanging areas of executional improvement you see in the company where you say, here is why the company has not executed on these opportunities the last couple of years the way that they could have and here's how I'm going to fix those, maybe lay a couple of those out for us? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Sure. Thanks, Brian. A couple of thoughts there. First of all, I'd say some of these things is a natural sequence of how these things evolve. I talked about a really good base of visual exploration, the computer vision and machine learning is required to support that. I think those have always been a strength of the platform and I think underpin the opportunity. And so, I think there's a natural sequencing of these things that, of course, you need that first. And then as you look at how you go capitalize on that, I think there -- I'd say context and timing matters as well. I think we're at a moment in time where users are engaging in much more of their e-commerce journey, excuse me, much more of their broader commerce journey in a digital environment. And so, I think -- as you think about sort of where digital commerce has been, I think the first 20-plus years of e-commerce were really solving for buying more than shopping. It was \u2013 I know what I want, how do I get the cheapest and fastest? And as you've seen consumers shift their behavior through the course of the pandemic, I think you're now seeing that the majority of shopping sessions now start in a digital environment, regardless of whether they complete online or in a store. So in that world, where the consumer is looking to engage in a digital manner across not just their e-commerce purchases, but a broader set of purchases, I think the way that they have engaged in shopping in the natural world, which involve much more discovery and inspiration and is much more visual, I think, just naturally plays to the strengths of Pinterest as a product and a platform. So, I think that context and timing matters. I think then in addition to that, I'd say the ability to go in just a lot more catalogs from a much broader set of players, it also really doubling down their investments, whether that's retailers or other commerce platforms, I think, gives us a lot of the right raw material to go drive that to action and as well as users being really, I think, ready to engage in a broader part of their shopping journey in a digital environment. So those are a few things that I would mention that I think put us in a great place to capitalize on these. And then the efforts that are here, it's worth noting and Todd has spoken to some of this, shopping is already driving meaningful revenue growth in the company. So, I think these are things that are already seeing really good benefit when you think about shopping ads and what that is doing for our revenue growth, I think the totality of the shopping experience is already a lot of good progress on that and more momentum for us to build on. And the final thing I'd say is, when we talk about going from inspiration and intent to action, there's a lot of different ways we can take people to action. And so, I think some of the efforts I've seen across the industry can at times get hung up on, did you complete a purchase on the platform? And back to learnings on what can work, I think there are a number of ways to help users take action and a number of ways to help users and retailers and brands connect more deeply. And so, thinking about that through the lens of just buying can be overly limiting. And so, I think that's also an opportunity for us to leverage a number of ways that users can engage more deeply with retailers and brands. Buying is certainly one of those, but there are multiple ways that we can help deepen those engagements, and that's part of what we are exploring, and we'll continue to explore. There was a second part for Todd, I believe.\nTodd Morgenfeld: On the -- sorry. What was that -- Brian, sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question?\nBill Ready: Let's move on.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Operator, let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Next comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks, guys. This is Jan Lee [ph] for Mark Mahaney. Maybe just a follow-up on just the opportunity in the shopping ads growth. What would you think are the kind of -- if you were to rank order the key drivers of that growth in this category, is it just like any more inventory on to the platform? Is it better recommendation or kind of leaning more into creators content? And the second question is, we really haven't talked about the creator content investment. So just given the current environment, how you're thinking about investing in the kind of creator content? And also, you kind of mentioned the time spent on competition from the other video platforms. When do you think about kind of creator or content acquisition, how much do you have to compete with like TikTok, YouTube, shorts, reels, et cetera, or are you kind of -- are you finding yourself acquiring from like a different type of creators than the other platforms? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So I can start on the shopping discussion. The way I think about shopping on our platform is either a pure shopping ads, so promoted product or our conversion optimization product, particularly checkouts and additions to a card. So very shopping-oriented performance ads. The success that we're seeing in general is the focus on building a great user experience. So how do we get enough inventory that if you're looking for something that we have the product and the system to serve to you, it's mapped to your aesthetic taste, your price point, a retailer that you trust and is delivered in a natural part of your shopping journey. So getting 1 billion products into the system, which came on the back of high-performing partnerships with Shopify and WooCommerce and with our merchants who are increasingly using our API to get real-time inventory with real-time pricing into the system, that's been really powerful in building the inventory we need to serve against a user's interest or intent. The second thing is, we're building out more personalized shopping experiences into the core of the product. So your shop is an example that I referenced earlier. That's our first real effort in a personalized shopping experience. We bought THE YES or acquired THE YES a couple of months ago to help augment that effort. And I think that piece, coupled with the inventory that we've built into the system, will continue to build more organic shopping experiences for our users. What that means is that we can then deliver ads products against that. And our investments in automation have made that more successful. We've talked over the last couple of years about automated bidding that extended to some of our lower-funnel conversion products. We're looking forward to launching in the back half of this year more campaign level automation, which will continue to power even more performance in these areas. So all of that has been working together to build a better shopping business for us. On the creator and content side, I can start. I don't know, Bill, if you want to weigh in, but we were really delighted this quarter to look at some of our stats and see that 10% of time spent on the platform now is users watching video. That includes our Watch tab and our Idea Pins. That's powered by a lot of content that's coming from individuals, but also through some partnerships that we announced, most notably Tastemade, where they're helping us build idea pins, a lot of shows and then increasingly Pinterest TV live programming around the world. So, both organic and user generated as well as through partnerships. We also improved through a lot of the investments we've made in machine learning, our relevance in short-form video content and our Idea Pins. So, relevance improved a ton quarter-over-quarter to the point now where we're seeing relevance almost at parity across Idea Pins and our static images, which was a big improvement. And so all of that means that when we get the idea ads format working, not only will this be accretive to engagement but accretive to revenue over time. We were delighted to announce Idea ads launching in the quarter. So, all of what we think about building relevance, getting richer content onto the platform and extending that to business building, we made progress against that in the quarter. So I don't know if that answers your question, or Bill, you wanted to add anything?\nBill Ready: Yes, exactly right. The only other thing I'd add to it is that as we think about the way we're engaging with content creators, we see they appreciate the uniqueness of our platform as well, both it's a positive place to engage as well as the strong think that's something that both our advertisers see from us and are excited about from us. But we see the content creators really appreciate that about the platform as well. I think it leads to different types of opportunities for how creators can engage on our platform and the kinds of content and user engagement that can come from that. And it also means that we can play our own game on how we work with content creators. Of course, we don't expect that we're going to match dollar for dollar with larger platforms, but we can create unique ways to engage. We believe we can attract content creators that are here for the specific users and environment that we have as well as the intent that they have, which is very different from other platforms where that intent may not be there or the intent is one of looking for the next entertaining video that can sometimes be harder for creators to keep up versus a platform where people are coming with an intent to either shop or make or do and that being be more enduring for those reasons and so I think that's an important part of our platform, both for advertisers, but that also creators are really noticing and allows us to play our own game there.\nNeil Doshi: Operator. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks and good afternoon Bill, congrats again. It's been fun following your journey over the years. A couple of questions for either you or Todd. I guess, first off, there were some interesting comments in the letter related to Idea Pins relevance. And I guess I'm curious if there's a direct connection between how you're measuring relevance there and engagement you're seeing with users? And then secondly, I think you touched on this a little bit before regarding near-term trends. But given that the guidance for revenues in Q3 is a bit more positive than what we've seen from other -- most other digital platforms at this point. Just curious what you're hearing from advertisers in terms of feedback related to factors that are making Pinterest more resilient than some of the other platforms? Thank you.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Colin. Appreciate the sentiment there. I'll give some brief remarks, and then Todd can add to it. I think, yes, we've seen really nice engagement with Idea Pins and video generally. And I think Todd mentioned this earlier, 10% of engagement being over video from a couple of years ago, that would have been near zero, I think, is really fantastic progress. I think Idea Pins are a really great example of that and Todd can expand on that a little further in terms of what the teams are seeing there. On the advertiser feedback, again, again, Todd will have more color commentary here. But I think there's -- I've talked about the uniqueness of what's on the platform. I think as we go forward into an environment where users are thinking -- or excuse me, advertisers are thinking about where they place their dollars, I think a relatively brand-safe environment on the platform, high-user intent, and we uniquely have first-party signal on our platform. So when you think about Pinterest relative to other platforms and shifts that are happening with regard to cookies and these kinds of things, the fact that we have really great first-party signal. Todd mentioned 80% plus of our users and our engagement being on our mobile app. These are things that give us really good first-party signal and really good understanding of user intent. We don't need to understand user intent from outside our platform. We have it on our platform. And I think that's something that advertisers really appreciate and that we're able to drive through into our ad. I'll give it to Todd to expand on those.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. Look, I think that's a great summary. I would say that we're really excited about the investments we're making in relevance and the impact that's having on -- bringing our Idea Pin format into closer -- something closer to parity with our static pins. That's a precursor for success in terms of engagement. So when it flows through our top line numbers, and we start to see that curve the trajectory of engagement band, we'll know it's having a bigger picture impact, but it's foundational for us to get to that point. On the advertiser side, I think Bill summarized it well. And one thing that we don't have on this platform, I kind of walk through the history of how we built our advertiser base and the legacy of being exposed more to larger CPG and larger retailers during moments like this can be more beneficial. We don't have a lot of gaming app download, crypto ads, for example, on the platform. A lot of it's around home, food, fashion and beauty with our larger, more resilient advertisers. I had mentioned the joint business partnership point in my opening comments because I thought it was an important indicator for us as being an alternative to the larger incumbents for advertising dollars, but still on the list given the issues that Bill had mentioned in the way I had opened demographics, brand safety, leading indicators of consumer intent and commercial mindset on the platform and being early in a purchase journey are all differentiators. So I wouldn't want you to take away from this that we're in a different economic environment, though, than many of our -- others in our space. We started the quarter particularly strong. And a lot of our leading indicators, as I had mentioned, are softening as we see this demand picture become a little more uncertain with the quarter unfolding. And so I wouldn't want to tell you we're in a totally different market environment than others. We just started off stronger than the -- slightly stronger than the range that I described. And our best signals are that we're going to see some deceleration as the quarter unfolds.\nNeil Doshi: And operator, we\u2019ll take our last question.\nOperator: The final question will come from Rich Greenland \u2013 Greenfield. My apologies from LightShed. Please proceed.\nRich Greenfield: I've never been to Greenland, but I'm sure I could find it on Pinterest. On -- sorry. In the letter, Bill, you talked about Google Search. Obviously, Google Search has been a pressure on the business for -- over the last several quarters. And you talked about relying on sort of new ways of demand generation or driving traffic or sourcing traffic. And I was wondering if you could just sort of give us some more examples. When you talk about sharing Idea Pins on third-party platforms and even when you're talking about notifications, I assume that's AI for push notifications. But I was hoping -- could you give us some examples of sort of on both of those things tangible, what you're seeing, how it's impacting the business and what we should expect going forward? And then sort of just a big picture housekeeping point because you both brought it up. If the mobile users are driving 80-plus percent of your revenue, why not just report mobile users? It seems like that's the most relevant indicator of what's tied to revenue growth? And why not just forget about this or even deemphasize this overall MAU metric if the mobile MAU is really the one that matters? Thanks.\nBill Ready: All right. Thank you, Rich. I'll let Todd hit the last question on how we report the users. But on your question of how we're driving engagement, there's a number of factors. You touched on one of those that we did as well, which is we're getting a lot of direct engagement through our mobile app. So that's always a great place to be, to have 80% plus of your engagement through the mobile app where people are coming to you directly. So that as a base is fantastic. We're using a lot of ML and AI to improve our personalization across all of our services. That drives up further engagement. And I think the team has been -- as I mentioned earlier, I've been really impressed coming inside and seeing the progress the team has been making there. And I think there's a lot more of that to come in terms of advances in the machine learning and AI front to improve personalization. It's the strength of the platform. So a lot more we can do there. Native content creators, I think that engagements will be more accretive over time, and we're seeing good progress there as noted with 10% of engagement being on video now. And I think we've talked about taking people from inspiration and intent to action, but there's a lot of the inspiration intent -- inspiration and intent on our platform that people historically had to go to other platforms that take action. And as we make more of that actionable on our platform, that will naturally drive up further engagement as well. And we see early signs of that with things like the progress in shopping ads. And with respect to SEO, I think teams are making good progress, leveraging our machine learning and AI capabilities for multiple channels of engagement, including things like notification, e-mail and seeing good returns on those things as well as things like social sharing. There are number of factors there. There's no one silver bullet. It's broad-based, but I actually find that to be quite encouraging that there's no one silver bullet, but actually a broad base of activities that's driving really good progress and engagement. And I'll give it to Todd to address the user reporting part of the question.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. We're always open to evaluating disclosure and so, I will keep an open mind about it and consider it. The reason we've been bringing it up for the last few quarters is, we thought there was a bit of a deviation in the trend that we've seen historically. And so, I thought it would be important context for this community and for investors to understand what's going on with our web-based traffic versus those that are coming direct or using the mobile app. I thought it was also important to call out that impression and revenue contribution, just so folks would understand how we could be seeing these MAU declines, but continue our financial performance right through it, which is one of the factors that play here, in addition to all the investments we're making in our ad stack and efficiency there, plus our demand generation. To your point specifically, the reason I kept it and have kept it is that, it's a pretty inclusive way of thinking about the people that come and discover Pinterest content, number one. Number two, we have often viewed these web-based users who come to us through search traffic as our upper funnel user acquisition. These are people that are discovering Pinterest content through search, they're existing users that are resurrected, and they rediscover reasons to come back to Pinterest. And so, from a broader aperture perspective, it's a pretty useful way of thinking about those that are finding Pinterest content and are potential future mobile app users because they found this content through search. But of course, we'll always consider what's most useful for this community to understand the business and its prospects.\nOperator: Now I'll turn it over to Bill for final comments.\nBill Ready: Yes. Thank you again to everyone for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with you as we execute on the many exciting opportunities ahead and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. I'd like to share some further details on the trends we saw in Q2 and provide a preliminary update for Q3. Before I jump into the quarter, a quick review of our principles. As Bill mentioned, Pinterest is uniquely valuable for consumers because it helps them discover new ideas and then bring those ideas to life often through purchases. But the full funnel journey that consumers take on Pinterest from demand inception through product consideration to conversion means that Pinterest offers differentiated value for a wide range of advertisers, too. And the ways in which they engage with Pinterest are quite distinct from social media companies. This is due to our users' unique mindset. They tend to be in-market consumers with high commercial intent. Initially, our service attracted mostly larger retail and consumer packaged goods or CPG advertisers who wanted to be discovered by our user base and recognize the value of the fact that well over 90% of Pinner queries were unbranded and still are today. These advertisers remain an important part of our business and make Pinterest's advertiser composition a fair bit different than many other online advertising platforms. But we've also built a significant performance advertising business over the past several years that has helped marketers leverage the organic commercial intent on Pinterest to drive conversions, often additions to a cart, checkouts or purchases. The advertisers who reliably find strong returns on Pinterest are those who value our unique offering, including our differentiated and highly attractive user demographic, the high commercial intent that I just described, a relatively brand-safe environment, insights-led media buying and longer attribution windows that reflect the value of advertising at the inception of actual demand when the value of advertising is arguably higher than later in a purchase decision. To that end and despite challenging macro conditions, we saw resilience from our large advertising partners, with 25% growth in spend commitments from joint business partnerships in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. As a reminder, these joint business partnerships, while nonbinding, are indications of sizable spend commitments from larger advertisers who often view Pinterest as an important channel to reach their consumers. These partnerships often suggest that we are an established channel for those partners rather than an experimental platform. Furthermore, we're focused on expanding our monetization to new geographies, and it's beginning to drive results. While we had 223 million monthly active users in our Rest of World segment, our revenue in Rest of World in Q2 was just $22 million. However, our Rest of World ARPU increased by 80% year-over-year. In line with this strategy, we launched ads in Japan in the second quarter. And in July, we expanded into Chile, Argentina and Colombia. And we're excited to monetize our emerging markets. On a year-over-year basis, our monthly active users declined 5%. Some of the factors contributing to our year-over-year MAU decline are easier to quantify such as lower search traffic, largely driven by Google's algorithm change in November of last year, which resulted in fewer new users and resurrections, and the last vestiges of the pandemic unwind, which we believe we largely lapped at the end of Q2. We do also face increasing competition for time spent on competitive video-centric platforms, primarily in our mature markets, but it's challenging to quantify or measure the impact to our engagement on these platforms. These year-over-year declines were most pronounced for our web users, which dropped approximately 30% year-over-year, while our global mobile app users remain far more resilient, growing 8% year-over-year. It's worth noting that in the US and Canada, our mobile app users were flat sequentially, which was a particularly positive signal during our seasonally weakest quarter of the year for engagement. It's important to note that our global mobile app users represent well over 80% of our revenue and our impressions. So resilience with mobile app users is an important signal for financial performance and capacity. Turning to our financial performance. Q2 revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $666 million or 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, our revenue grew 16%. On a two-year basis, revenue accelerated at an annualized rate of 56% in the second quarter compared to 45% growth in the first quarter. In Europe, our revenue grew 22% year-over-year when adjusting for the 12-point headwind due to the strength of the US dollar. On the demand side, the digital advertising environment has been and will continue to be challenging. While we saw strength from retail and international advertisers, we experienced softer demand from CPG, big-box retailers and our mid-market advertisers. Despite these headwinds, shopping ads continue to make progress on the platform. In Q2, shopping ads revenue grew twice as fast as overall revenue year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $92 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16% sequentially. We thoughtfully designed a plan to invest during the course of 2022. In the first half of the year, we invested heavily and made key hires to augment the organization, which we believe will drive growth in the long term. Also for context in the first quarter, we spent less than we originally anticipated due to slower-than-expected hiring in R&D and a delay in our creator-related marketing spend. In the second quarter, we saw an opportunity to augment our R&D team as the recruiting market became more favorable and our recruiting execution improved.  Also, we caught up on some originally planned creator-related marketing. In addition, our G&A expenses increased sequentially, with headcount growth and related payroll spend in our human resources and recruiting teams being the largest contributor. Roughly 1/4 of the sequential increase in expense we expect to be nonrecurring at these levels. Finally, our employees returning to office in the second quarter as COVID protocols changed drove some costs, including an increase in facilities and travel and entertainment-related costs. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q3. I'd like to first touch on monthly active users. As we mentioned last quarter, we're either providing users, nor an intra-quarter update. But I'd like to offer some additional context on how we're thinking about engagement in the back half of this year. With the pandemic unwind largely behind us, we believe that global monthly active users will return to more seasonal -- more typical seasonal engagement patterns in the second half of the year. Those seasonal patterns typically show modest sequential growth as we move to Q3 and Q4. However, these trends may be a bit more muted than they have been historically and for the US, Canada and Europe specifically, we hope to stabilize our user base in the back half of the year. While the pandemic unwind is largely behind us, we face increasing and sustained competition from video-centric apps for users' share of time spent. And as always, this color assumes that we don't face any incremental exogenous engagement headwinds like further search algorithm changes. I'll now turn to revenue guidance. Given the dynamic nature of the economy today and how quickly conditions can improve or worsen, we thought it would be prudent to provide a fairly broad range rather than providing a point estimate like last quarter. We currently expect Q3 revenue to grow in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year percentage basis. We're growing slightly faster quarter-to-date, but many of our advertising partners, especially larger retailers are experiencing supply chain issues, inflation and weakening consumer demand. These conditions are weighing on advertisers' ability to spend and our best signals of future performance suggests a slowdown from the growth rate we saw in July. This anticipated slowdown will likely land us toward the lower end of our guidance range. Moreover, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we could end up with revenue growth at the bottom end of the range or below in the low single digits. Please note that in addition to the challenging economic environment, our Q3 revenue guide of mid-single digits reflects a few other considerations. First, we anticipate slightly greater foreign exchange headwinds when compared to Q2. Second, we continue to monitor the impact of higher CPAs as a result of platform-specific dynamics and our engagement trends. We believe higher pricing may disproportionately affect price-sensitive advertisers' ability to utilize their budgets on our platform. That said, we continue to believe that advertisers who value the things I discussed earlier, that make Pinterest unique, will continue to find success on our platform. Third, Idea Pin distribution will have a modest low single-digit impact to revenue growth in Q3. And as we lap this, we do not believe Idea Pins will be a further meaningful headwind to revenue in Q4 and beyond. Finally, I want to discuss our expense guide and our philosophy around investments. As Bill discussed, we're living in a more uncertain environment marked by slower revenue growth and greater demand volatility. While our business has proven relatively resilient, we're conscious of the economic climate. So far, we've meaningfully slowed the pace of hiring, as we reevaluate our needs for the second half of this year and how best to support our plans for longer-term growth. We will be even more strategic and selective in our hiring plans for the remainder of 2022. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double digits quarter-over-quarter due to our global brand marketing campaign that we intend to launch in mid-September and run through late October, continued investments in our native content and creator efforts and the impact of our recent hiring. We believe that investments in marketing, especially for our mature and newly monetizing markets, can build on and amplify the progress we're making in our core engagement work, and we believe these investments could yield strong returns in the future. For the full year, there's no change to our previous guide of non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the range of 35% to 40% year-over-year, with a continued deceleration in sequential expense growth from the second quarter's peak levels. As we said at the start of this year, after three consecutive years of significant margin expansion, we view 2022 as the right time to accelerate investments to better position ourselves to capitalize on our long-term growth potential. We still believe that this is the right approach. But given the increasingly dynamic market environment and with Bill joining the company, we are evaluating our investment profile for the second half of this year and beyond. While there is a significant long-term runway ahead for the business, we have accelerated much of our desired investments into 2022 and believe that we will start to see the benefits of those investments next year. As such, we plan to return to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. As you know, we've long been focused on achieving the appropriate balance between realizing our long-term potential and delivering near-term financial results. We have approximately $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and Bill and I are discussing how we should be allocating our capital. In Q2, we acquired THE YES, which reinforces our commitment to connecting the commercial intent on our platform with personalized shopping experiences. We'll continue to be thoughtful and strategic about our deployment of cash with respect to future M&A. Bill and I are committed to delivering value for shareholders and will discuss our longer-term strategic framework with you going forward. Thanks to our employees at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration, plan and shop. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill for a brief comment before we open it up to questions. Yes, a couple of things. I mean, obviously, we're all very excited to move forward on the vision that Bill is starting to lay out here. But on the shopping question, in particular, you might remember back over the last couple of calls that we've been very focused on making sure we have a lot of shoppable inventory and then we have the right shoppable services for people to discover those products. And so a lot of our effort has come through building an inventory of shopping products that we can map to commercial intent and our users' preferences. We're now to one billion shoppable products in the system. And on the shoppable surfaces side, we launched Your Shop, which is our first personalized shopping experience. That will be augmented by the acquisition we made with YES and help our users continue to go from intent to action on the platform. So really excited about those two things. And on top of that, we're building, as I mentioned in my script, our shopping revenue is growing twice the rate of our overall revenue. So really compelling vision financially behind what Bill was describing. The second part of your question was around the expense profile and what we meant by meaningful margin expansion, I think, if I heard your question correctly. And I think the tee up here is, number one, the business has a ton of runway. Everything Bill described suggests that we've got a big business to build here. And in the spirit of that, we laid out 2022, a couple of calls ago as an investment year after several years of significant margin expansion leading into 2022. But this isn't a new normal, or it's just a year where we designed to position the company for an improved user experience, future compelling revenue growth and margin expansion in the years to come. And so I've had questions about whether next year will be another reset or another investment year. But as you heard Bill described, while we're still spending a lot of time together to figure out what that plan is, and this is way too early to provide guidance for next year, we're looking at the macro environment, we're getting together as a team to figure out what our product plans will be for next year. So it's not guidance. But the idea here is that we would see as much as couple hundred basis points of margin expansion going into next year, just to provide some directional input. Thank you for the question, and I appreciate the sentiment. So I'll keep my comments focused on the opportunity here, but definitely a lot of things from time spent in the industry that drew me to Pinterest and then I think speak to the uniqueness of the opportunity here. So a couple of those that I would mention. One, when you think about what it takes to create a really great personalized and curated visual experience, you really need a lot of deep capabilities in computer vision, machine learning, AI. And those things, as you can imagine, are nontrivial to create. And even before Pinterest -- before joining Pinterest, I really had a tremendous amount of respect for what the team here had done in creating a great visual experience, leveraging a lot of computer vision and driving really good personalization through ML and AI. And I'd say now on the inside, I'm even more excited by those things. And so when I think about how we go forward on the shopping opportunities here, I think that's a really tremendous area of strength for Pinterest, is leveraging those deep capabilities in computer vision and the visual nature of how people naturally explore a shopping journey and a really good ML and AI to personalize those what's really relevant for the specific user. And then you see some things that the team here has already been working on that we can do a lot more with like partnering with other platforms in the ecosystem, making it easier to ingest inventory from those platforms and from retailers, so there's an even more rich catalog of products available for consumers to take action on. So I think there's a number of those things that I can see from the outside that I thought were quite compelling. And now on the inside, I find even more compelling. But obviously, a lot more that we can do there. And so that's quite exciting as well. But I still think that we're very early innings on that. But again, solving things that the user, I believe, expects from Pinterest, and that's a great place to be when you're solving things that a user naturally expects from your platform. On the -- sorry. What was that -- Brian, sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question? Operator, let's go to the next question. So I can start on the shopping discussion. The way I think about shopping on our platform is either a pure shopping ads, so promoted product or our conversion optimization product, particularly checkouts and additions to a card. So very shopping-oriented performance ads. The success that we're seeing in general is the focus on building a great user experience. So how do we get enough inventory that if you're looking for something that we have the product and the system to serve to you, it's mapped to your aesthetic taste, your price point, a retailer that you trust and is delivered in a natural part of your shopping journey. So getting 1 billion products into the system, which came on the back of high-performing partnerships with Shopify and WooCommerce and with our merchants who are increasingly using our API to get real-time inventory with real-time pricing into the system, that's been really powerful in building the inventory we need to serve against a user's interest or intent. The second thing is, we're building out more personalized shopping experiences into the core of the product. So your shop is an example that I referenced earlier. That's our first real effort in a personalized shopping experience. We bought THE YES or acquired THE YES a couple of months ago to help augment that effort. And I think that piece, coupled with the inventory that we've built into the system, will continue to build more organic shopping experiences for our users. What that means is that we can then deliver ads products against that. And our investments in automation have made that more successful. We've talked over the last couple of years about automated bidding that extended to some of our lower-funnel conversion products. We're looking forward to launching in the back half of this year more campaign level automation, which will continue to power even more performance in these areas. So all of that has been working together to build a better shopping business for us. On the creator and content side, I can start. I don't know, Bill, if you want to weigh in, but we were really delighted this quarter to look at some of our stats and see that 10% of time spent on the platform now is users watching video. That includes our Watch tab and our Idea Pins. That's powered by a lot of content that's coming from individuals, but also through some partnerships that we announced, most notably Tastemade, where they're helping us build idea pins, a lot of shows and then increasingly Pinterest TV live programming around the world. So, both organic and user generated as well as through partnerships. We also improved through a lot of the investments we've made in machine learning, our relevance in short-form video content and our Idea Pins. So, relevance improved a ton quarter-over-quarter to the point now where we're seeing relevance almost at parity across Idea Pins and our static images, which was a big improvement. And so all of that means that when we get the idea ads format working, not only will this be accretive to engagement but accretive to revenue over time. We were delighted to announce Idea ads launching in the quarter. So, all of what we think about building relevance, getting richer content onto the platform and extending that to business building, we made progress against that in the quarter. So I don't know if that answers your question, or Bill, you wanted to add anything? Yes. Look, I think that's a great summary. I would say that we're really excited about the investments we're making in relevance and the impact that's having on -- bringing our Idea Pin format into closer -- something closer to parity with our static pins. That's a precursor for success in terms of engagement. So when it flows through our top line numbers, and we start to see that curve the trajectory of engagement band, we'll know it's having a bigger picture impact, but it's foundational for us to get to that point. On the advertiser side, I think Bill summarized it well. And one thing that we don't have on this platform, I kind of walk through the history of how we built our advertiser base and the legacy of being exposed more to larger CPG and larger retailers during moments like this can be more beneficial. We don't have a lot of gaming app download, crypto ads, for example, on the platform. A lot of it's around home, food, fashion and beauty with our larger, more resilient advertisers. I had mentioned the joint business partnership point in my opening comments because I thought it was an important indicator for us as being an alternative to the larger incumbents for advertising dollars, but still on the list given the issues that Bill had mentioned in the way I had opened demographics, brand safety, leading indicators of consumer intent and commercial mindset on the platform and being early in a purchase journey are all differentiators. So I wouldn't want you to take away from this that we're in a different economic environment, though, than many of our -- others in our space. We started the quarter particularly strong. And a lot of our leading indicators, as I had mentioned, are softening as we see this demand picture become a little more uncertain with the quarter unfolding. And so I wouldn't want to tell you we're in a totally different market environment than others. We just started off stronger than the -- slightly stronger than the range that I described. And our best signals are that we're going to see some deceleration as the quarter unfolds. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. We're always open to evaluating disclosure and so, I will keep an open mind about it and consider it. The reason we've been bringing it up for the last few quarters is, we thought there was a bit of a deviation in the trend that we've seen historically. And so, I thought it would be important context for this community and for investors to understand what's going on with our web-based traffic versus those that are coming direct or using the mobile app. I thought it was also important to call out that impression and revenue contribution, just so folks would understand how we could be seeing these MAU declines, but continue our financial performance right through it, which is one of the factors that play here, in addition to all the investments we're making in our ad stack and efficiency there, plus our demand generation.

            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and hi, everyone. Appreciate you joining our call. Today is going to be a bit different. In addition to announcing results, we're also marking an exciting new chapter for Pinterest. A few weeks ago, we welcomed our new CEO, Bill Ready. Today, you're going to hear from him and see why we're all excited to have him at the helm. But before I turn it over to him and Todd, I just want to quickly touch on why we made the transition. First, I absolutely love Pinterest and cherish the journey we've been on for more than a decade. It all began in 2010 as a tool to help people collect all the things they love from across the Internet. And in the years since, Pinterest has grown into something bigger and more meaningful. Today, Pinterest is a place where 433 million people all over the world come to get inspiration, a place where content creators can share their talents and passions with an inspired global audience and a place where brands can connect with consumers trying to build their best lives. I am grateful to everyone who's made this journey possible; first, our Pinners, our extraordinarily talented team and all of the investors and businesses who've supported us along the way. I'm proud of what we've achieved together. But as far as we've come, I know Pinterest could be more. It's so clear that we have an opportunity to build an end-to-end platform, one that delights people with incredible inspiration, helps them plan their futures and then bring those plans to life with purchases and actions. It's an ambitious vision that's bigger than one person, including a founder. And so, for our next stage of growth, we sought a leader with expertise in e-commerce and shopping to help us capitalize on the strong user intent and planning behavior on our platform. I met and talked with a lot of people. Bill's skill set and experience stood out. He's a builder who scaled companies like Braintree and Venmo. He knows how to operate a global scale from his time as CEO of PayPal. He's a leader in commerce, most recently as President of Commerce, Payments and Next Billion Users of Google. And beyond his resume, he shares our values and our aspiration of building a positive corner of the Internet that's nourishing and encouraging. His passion is the same as ours, creating products that people love. It became clear to me that Bill will be a fantastic CEO for Pinterest next chapter, and the Board felt the same way after discussions with them and that's why we made the move. I could not be more excited about where Bill is going to lead Pinterest in the future. I know there's a huge opportunity ahead of us. I'm looking forward to fully supporting Bill's vision and strategy, and I can't wait to see how he leads us into the next great chapter of our story. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to share a few thoughts. Bill?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben and hello everyone. I first want to express my gratitude to Ben and the Board for their trust in me as Pinterest CEO. As a fellow entrepreneur, I have tremendous respect for Ben and what he's accomplished at Pinterest. Under Ben's leadership, Pinterest has grown into a global consumer Internet platform with hundreds of millions of users, has scaled revenue to over $2 billion, and the Pinterest brand is synonymous with positivity. It's been roughly a month since I became CEO. And after talking with some of our key stakeholders and reviewing our product roadmap, I'm even more excited today about our business opportunity ahead. I know that maintaining a healthy dialogue and relationship with the investor community is an important part of our success. That's why I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing why I joined Pinterest and outlining what you can expect in the next few months. I joined Pinterest because it offers people a digital experience that is genuinely unique and positive and because we've only just begun to tap into the possibilities that experience has to create value for users and advertisers. Pinterest is really one of the only platforms that sits at the intersection of social media, search and e-commerce. And I'm incredibly excited to help unlock the company's potential. Having spent most of my career in commerce and payments, I recognize that there are many places to buy online, but there are very few online destinations where you can actually shop, that is to browse and discover and get inspired before you buy.  Pinterest is very unique, and it has inspiration, discovery, and strong user intent, all in the same place. Pinterest is one of the few places online where users can discover new products by browsing and searching in a curated, personalized setting before they even know exactly what they want. What happens next is similarly unique. Pinterest don't just scroll through or like images. They save relevant pins to thematic boards. This active saving content again shows how differentiated the Pinner mindset is. You save something because you plan to return and take action on it. This type of engagement is a highly differentiated first-party signal we can leverage to create value for Pinners and advertisers alike. It allows Pinterest to better leverage organic engagement activity and makes the platform less vulnerable to certain ongoing changes in the broader technology landscape. From my perspective, we have an enormous opportunity to lean further into the significant intent and first-party signal that we have on the platform to help users bring the ideas and inspiration they found on Pinterest to life. At the same time, I believe that Pinterest's unique use case appeals to advertisers of all shapes and sizes, and gives advertisers the opportunity to engage a crucial and highly valuable moments in the user's purchase journey when the user has clear intent, but is still determining what to buy. Longer term, this unique combination of inspiration and intent can be applied to many categories and I'm excited to help broaden and diversify the base of advertisers by making the platform easier to use. And we have a fantastic team to capitalize on these opportunities. I've been very impressed with the people at Pinterest and their commitment and enthusiasm for our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We truly live our mission. Over the next few months, I'll be digging deeper into our product strategy, on engagement and content as well as on the planning and shopping side. I'll be meeting with more of our key stakeholders, including Pinners, our employees, advertisers and agencies, strategic business partners and our shareholders to understand their needs. And I'm going to work with our leadership team on how we can update a durable long-term strategy to deliver value across the board. I recognize that there is a lot of work ahead of us, especially during a period of significant macroeconomic headwinds and general consumer uncertainty, but we're operating today from a position of strength, with a growing business that is differentiated in the market and offers a distinct value proposition to advertisers that Todd will address further in his remarks. Pinterest is a business that has generated attractive margins and cash flow, and is in an incredibly sound financial position with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Given the strength of our financial position today, I'm also focused on evaluating the best uses of capital for Pinterest, and we'll be considering this as we update our broader strategic plan, which we'll share more of in the coming months. Additionally, I'm reviewing our investment profile to understand the return on investment of our expenses and to determine the best way to optimize in a resource-constrained environment. Given the growth that we are seeing, combined with the significant potential opportunity ahead of us, we are continuing to invest in the business this year, and Todd will give more detail on that. But it's worth saying that I do not subscribe to a growth at all cost mentality. While I believe we need to invest in long-term growth, I also believe that constraints breed creativity and can lead to even better product outcomes. And we have an extremely creative team here. So while 2022 is an investment year, I'll be focused on aligning our investments with our objectives of creating a differentiated experience for our users, helping our existing and new advertisers achieve success on our platform, and generating attractive returns on our investments for shareholders. Consistent with that, Todd and I agree that Pinterest plans to return to meaningful margin expansion in 2023. I look forward to communicating more about our plans in the coming months. Now, I'll turn it over to Todd to talk about the quarter. Thanks, Todd. Before we move to Q&A, I want to address recent news reports regarding a large investment from Elliott Management. We've had a very collaborative and engaged dialogue with Elliott recently. They're aligned with our vision on what Pinterest can become, are supportive of our team and our efforts and see the same tremendous potential for long-term value creation that I do. I look forward to continuing to engage with Elliott as I will with our other shareholders and view their investment as a vote of confidence in Pinterest's future. But the purpose of today's call is to discuss our second quarter results and outlook, and we ask that you please keep your questions focused on these topics. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Excellent. Thank you for the question. So, quite a number of things I was excited about in joining Pinterest. But I think to a specific element of your question around how we drive forward on commercial engagement and these types of opportunities. As I mentioned a bit in my comments, I think Pinterest is in this very unique place of being at the intersection between social and search and having a very high amount of intent on the platform paired with inspiration. So, I think these things of when you think about what are the places you can go to find inspiration and discovery, oftentimes, those don't necessarily have intent built in with those, places that may have high intent don't necessarily have inspiration and discovery and Pinterest has both of those things. And I think that gives us a really unique opportunity to take users from this inspiration and discovery and the intent that they have on our platform and drive that through to realization, whether that is making or doing or buying. And I think we're really at the very beginning of what the platform can deliver there. But the thing that I was really excited about and continue to be really excited about now that I'm on the inside, as I look at the way that users are naturally engaging with the platform, it's a much harder problem to try to shift the way a user behaves. To help a user do a thing they already want to do is a much easier problem to solve, and that's something that we see on Pinterest that user are coming here with a clear intent -- yes, to hear for inspiration and discovery, they have a clear intent and driving that further to action, again, whether that's shopping, buying, making or doing, we think there's huge potential there. And there's some good early signs of that as we look at what's happening with shopping ads and some of the things there. And maybe I'll turn it over to Todd to expand further on some of the shopping progress as well as touch on your question around margins. And Ross, to your -- the second part of your question on the retailer point, more larger specialty retailers and larger e-commerce versus big box, I think you're spot on in your comments about what you're seeing in real time in the news and what others reports. Our larger specialty retailers and larger e-commerce were more resilient on the platform. The diversified big-box retailers were under a bit more pressure, just probably unsurprising given the demand environment and consumer spend. But the overall message is kind of where I started my opening comments. For advertisers that value the demographic mix of our users, that value the brand safety of the platform, that value the insights-led media buying that we're providing, and we've only enhanced that. It used to be a little bit more manual, and now we have automation around how these insights to design campaigns, and the value of being earlier in a purchase decision by communicating the value of a longer attribution window, those advertisers are finding success despite the environment and are scaling their spend. So to your point on, are we adding more, or are we getting more share of wallet, I would say it's both. And with that probably have your component of share of wallet versus adding a lot of mill advertisers in those particular segments. Sure. Thanks, Brian. A couple of thoughts there. First of all, I'd say some of these things is a natural sequence of how these things evolve. I talked about a really good base of visual exploration, the computer vision and machine learning is required to support that. I think those have always been a strength of the platform and I think underpin the opportunity. And so, I think there's a natural sequencing of these things that, of course, you need that first. And then as you look at how you go capitalize on that, I think there -- I'd say context and timing matters as well. I think we're at a moment in time where users are engaging in much more of their e-commerce journey, excuse me, much more of their broader commerce journey in a digital environment. And so, I think -- as you think about sort of where digital commerce has been, I think the first 20-plus years of e-commerce were really solving for buying more than shopping. It was \u2013 I know what I want, how do I get the cheapest and fastest? And as you've seen consumers shift their behavior through the course of the pandemic, I think you're now seeing that the majority of shopping sessions now start in a digital environment, regardless of whether they complete online or in a store. So in that world, where the consumer is looking to engage in a digital manner across not just their e-commerce purchases, but a broader set of purchases, I think the way that they have engaged in shopping in the natural world, which involve much more discovery and inspiration and is much more visual, I think, just naturally plays to the strengths of Pinterest as a product and a platform. So, I think that context and timing matters. I think then in addition to that, I'd say the ability to go in just a lot more catalogs from a much broader set of players, it also really doubling down their investments, whether that's retailers or other commerce platforms, I think, gives us a lot of the right raw material to go drive that to action and as well as users being really, I think, ready to engage in a broader part of their shopping journey in a digital environment. So those are a few things that I would mention that I think put us in a great place to capitalize on these. And then the efforts that are here, it's worth noting and Todd has spoken to some of this, shopping is already driving meaningful revenue growth in the company. So, I think these are things that are already seeing really good benefit when you think about shopping ads and what that is doing for our revenue growth, I think the totality of the shopping experience is already a lot of good progress on that and more momentum for us to build on. And the final thing I'd say is, when we talk about going from inspiration and intent to action, there's a lot of different ways we can take people to action. And so, I think some of the efforts I've seen across the industry can at times get hung up on, did you complete a purchase on the platform? And back to learnings on what can work, I think there are a number of ways to help users take action and a number of ways to help users and retailers and brands connect more deeply. And so, thinking about that through the lens of just buying can be overly limiting. And so, I think that's also an opportunity for us to leverage a number of ways that users can engage more deeply with retailers and brands. Buying is certainly one of those, but there are multiple ways that we can help deepen those engagements, and that's part of what we are exploring, and we'll continue to explore. There was a second part for Todd, I believe. Let's move on. Yes, exactly right. The only other thing I'd add to it is that as we think about the way we're engaging with content creators, we see they appreciate the uniqueness of our platform as well, both it's a positive place to engage as well as the strong think that's something that both our advertisers see from us and are excited about from us. But we see the content creators really appreciate that about the platform as well. I think it leads to different types of opportunities for how creators can engage on our platform and the kinds of content and user engagement that can come from that. And it also means that we can play our own game on how we work with content creators. Of course, we don't expect that we're going to match dollar for dollar with larger platforms, but we can create unique ways to engage. We believe we can attract content creators that are here for the specific users and environment that we have as well as the intent that they have, which is very different from other platforms where that intent may not be there or the intent is one of looking for the next entertaining video that can sometimes be harder for creators to keep up versus a platform where people are coming with an intent to either shop or make or do and that being be more enduring for those reasons and so I think that's an important part of our platform, both for advertisers, but that also creators are really noticing and allows us to play our own game there. Thanks, Colin. Appreciate the sentiment there. I'll give some brief remarks, and then Todd can add to it. I think, yes, we've seen really nice engagement with Idea Pins and video generally. And I think Todd mentioned this earlier, 10% of engagement being over video from a couple of years ago, that would have been near zero, I think, is really fantastic progress. I think Idea Pins are a really great example of that and Todd can expand on that a little further in terms of what the teams are seeing there. On the advertiser feedback, again, again, Todd will have more color commentary here. But I think there's -- I've talked about the uniqueness of what's on the platform. I think as we go forward into an environment where users are thinking -- or excuse me, advertisers are thinking about where they place their dollars, I think a relatively brand-safe environment on the platform, high-user intent, and we uniquely have first-party signal on our platform. So when you think about Pinterest relative to other platforms and shifts that are happening with regard to cookies and these kinds of things, the fact that we have really great first-party signal. Todd mentioned 80% plus of our users and our engagement being on our mobile app. These are things that give us really good first-party signal and really good understanding of user intent. We don't need to understand user intent from outside our platform. We have it on our platform. And I think that's something that advertisers really appreciate and that we're able to drive through into our ad. I'll give it to Todd to expand on those. All right. Thank you, Rich. I'll let Todd hit the last question on how we report the users. But on your question of how we're driving engagement, there's a number of factors. You touched on one of those that we did as well, which is we're getting a lot of direct engagement through our mobile app. So that's always a great place to be, to have 80% plus of your engagement through the mobile app where people are coming to you directly. So that as a base is fantastic. We're using a lot of ML and AI to improve our personalization across all of our services. That drives up further engagement. And I think the team has been -- as I mentioned earlier, I've been really impressed coming inside and seeing the progress the team has been making there. And I think there's a lot more of that to come in terms of advances in the machine learning and AI front to improve personalization. It's the strength of the platform. So a lot more we can do there. Native content creators, I think that engagements will be more accretive over time, and we're seeing good progress there as noted with 10% of engagement being on video now. And I think we've talked about taking people from inspiration and intent to action, but there's a lot of the inspiration intent -- inspiration and intent on our platform that people historically had to go to other platforms that take action. And as we make more of that actionable on our platform, that will naturally drive up further engagement as well. And we see early signs of that with things like the progress in shopping ads. And with respect to SEO, I think teams are making good progress, leveraging our machine learning and AI capabilities for multiple channels of engagement, including things like notification, e-mail and seeing good returns on those things as well as things like social sharing. There are number of factors there. There's no one silver bullet. It's broad-based, but I actually find that to be quite encouraging that there's no one silver bullet, but actually a broad base of activities that's driving really good progress and engagement. And I'll give it to Todd to address the user reporting part of the question. Yes. Thank you again to everyone for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with you as we execute on the many exciting opportunities ahead and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day."

All lines will be muted during the presentation course of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations of Pinterest. Please go ahead.\nNeil Doshi: Thanks, Bethany. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest\u2019s earnings call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. I\u2019m Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest.

And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Silbermann: Hi, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call. We\u2019ll open up with some comments and then take your questions. But just before we get started, I wanted to express on behalf of our entire company, that are hard to continue to go out to all those impacted by what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. We have members of our team who lived in the region and are now thankfully safe. And I\u2019m proud of how our company came together to support humanitarian efforts for Ukrainians. We\u2019ll continue to keep everyone affected in our thoughts during this unimaginable time. Turning to the business. A few minutes ago, we released our Q1 shareholder letter. Revenue was strong with 18% year-over-year growth to $575 million. This was due to strength from retail advertisers, our international business and our managed SMB advertisers, all of which offset the economic weakness we\u2019re seeing in CPG and in Europe because of the war. Meanwhile, we continue to face engagement headwinds. We had 433 million global monthly active users, down 9% compared to Q1 last year, a quarter that was driven by pandemic-influenced growth. We also felt the impacts of lower traffic from search and time spent by people on competitive platforms. We\u2019re doing a number of things to improve the Pinner experience and tackle engagement headwinds head on. In the near-term, we\u2019re applying sophisticated machine learning to every aspects of our platform. As a result, we\u2019ve seen marked improvements in the relevance of home feed recommendations, the quality of search results and engagement with notifications. All of these enhance the quality of our platform for Pinners, and are leading indicators of deeper user engagement. We also plan to launch a global brand awareness and comprehension marketing campaign starting in Q3. In the medium-term, we continue to invest in a rich content ecosystem with publishing tools that allow creators to publish rich lifestyle content on to Pinterest and we\u2019re also allowing people to take the content they find and create on Pinterest and share that inspiration with their friends, family and followers across the Internet. To do this well, we\u2019re also working to connect Pinners with the most inspirational creators and native content in dynamic formats like short-term video. As we\u2019ve discussed in past calls, this investment has come at the cost of some MAUs in the short term as we get the ecosystem off the ground. But we\u2019re committed to this strategy because we believe it will drive engagement over time and because we believe that native content in video, in particular, is fundamental to help the people get inspiration and shop in the future. In 2021, I\u2019m especially proud of our teams that laid the foundation for a native content ecosystem. It\u2019s gaining traction. The number of video idea Pinners is up 15x year-over-year, and this content is resonating with more and more people as we continue to see that Pinners, who follow multiple creators, visit Pinterest more often compared to those who do not. We plan to continue building new publishing tools with the help of our new acquisition, VOCHI, so creators can make even better content, content that\u2019s not only entertaining, but help us move our user base from inspiration all the way to action, content we\u2019re saving. We\u2019re also expanding rewards to bring on more inspirational creators to Pinterest. Finally, we continue invest in making Pinterest a shopping destination and we\u2019ve taken some big steps here. We launched the Pinterest API for shopping to help merchants and give Pinners a real-time information about the products they see from pricing to availability. We also started beta testing Your Shop, which uses our unique ability to understand taste and preferences, to deliver an experience for each Pinner that\u2019s personalized to them. This work is fundamental to our vision. So users can not only come to Pinterest with the expectation of being inspired but also know that they can turn those inspirations into a reality with purchases. Across the board, we continue to make progress in helping Pinners go from the spark of inspiration through to buying, making, trying, and doing. We\u2019re confident that our strategy will deliver great results for Pinners, creators, advertisers, merchants into our business. And we remain excited about the enormous opportunity to help people live a life they truly love. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd to give you more color into the business.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks Ben, I\u2019ll share some further details on the trends that we saw in the first quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for Q2. Beginning this quarter, we\u2019re providing additional disclosure around our revenue, our monthly active users or MAUs, our average revenue per user or ARPU by presenting the U.S. and Canada, Europe and rest of world separately. As our international operations become a more meaningful part of our business. We want to provide additional detail in those regions. Please refer to our earnings presentation for the new geographic breakouts. As part of this change, we re-categorize the U.S. into the U.S. and Canada. Please note that there is little difference in historical year-over-year and sequential growth rates for the U.S. alone versus the U.S. and Canada together. We\u2019re categorizing these two regions together going forward because they\u2019re both relatively mature and they share a similar advertiser base. Furthermore, while we\u2019ve provided U.S. monthly active users recognized revenue and ARPU for Q1. Going forward, we plan to only report these metrics for the new combined U.S. and Canada. Turning to our financial performance. Q1 revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $575 million, in line with our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $77 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13%. Most of the details on our quarterly performance can be found in our shareholder letter, but I wanted to provide you with some additional specific. As our international business has grown, we\u2019re becoming more subject to currency fluctuations. Revenue growth from Europe was 27% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth in Europe would have been approximately 34% year-over-year. And as we continued the distribution and placement of Idea Pins, we believe this negatively impacted our first quarter year-over-year revenue growth in the mid single-digits on a percentage basis similar to the prior two quarters. This impact was factored into our guidance for the first quarter. Turning to expenses. We accelerated our non-GAAP operating expense growth in the first quarter to 31% year-over-year versus 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, sequentially, our non-GAAP OpEx declined 1% due to pushing off creator-related spend, slower hiring than we anticipated, particularly in the bay area and a few other favorable items. Before getting into some specific trends on user engagement in the quarter, I want to double click on our strategy to combat engagement headwinds. As Ben mentioned, we\u2019re looking at ways to drive more sustainable user acquisition and retention. For example, we\u2019re making Pinterest more browsable without immediately requiring users to sign up when they land on the site. While this had a modest negative impact on global new user signups initially, we believe that removing barriers for longer browsing sessions can drive more activations over time. We also believe our investments in the core Pinner experience on home feed, search and shopping can make Pinterest feel more personal and relevant in the near to medium term. And that our investments in creator-led native content and short form videos can bend the curve on engagement in the long run. With respect to our Q1 engagement trends, it\u2019s worth noting that our global mobile app MAUs, which account for the significant majority of our impressions and revenue grew in the mid single digits year-over-year. Mobile app MAUs in the U.S. and Canada were also relatively resilient, declining around 6% year-over-year versus down 31% year-over-year for web-based MAUs. Sequentially, U.S. and Canada mobile app MAUs were flat. Our younger Gen Z users were also a source of strength growing mid single digits year-over-year. Finally, shopping engagement remained relatively resilient with the number of Pinners engaging and shopping surfaces is growing year-over-year. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q2. While we typically don\u2019t provide MAU guidance, for the last three quarters, we\u2019ve shared a quarter to date snapshot of MAUs in our earnings. As of April 25, U.S. and Canada MAUs were at 94 million and global MAUs were 432.9 million. We\u2019ve provided intra quarter data points on MAUs over the last few quarters because the lifting of pandemic lockdowns in 2021 disrupted our seasonal \u2013 our typical seasonal engagement patterns and limited visibility into quarterly MAU trends. Lockdowns began to lift for some geographies in mid-March 2021, which is when we began to see year-over-year engagement declines. Engagement continued to normalize toward pre-COVID levels throughout Q2 2021 as more geos lifted COVID restrictions. We believe that the pandemic unwind will no longer create a year-over-year MAU headwind in the third quarter of this year. So we don\u2019t plan on providing an intra quarter update on MAUs going forward. As you think about MAUs for Q2, I\u2019d like to provide you with some additional context. Q2 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter for MAUs, given that people tend to be outside more, travel more and engage in our core use cases less often. As a reminder, at the end of the quarter we calculate MAUs based on a 30 day look back from the last month of each quarter. Since June is one of our weaker months for engagement in the U.S., a snapshot of MAUs on April 25 may not predict June MAUs. And finally, we continue to face year-over-year growth headwinds from the search algorithm change that happened in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as potential new headwinds from future search algorithm updates the timing of which are hard to predict. On the revenue side, we expect Q2 revenue to grow around 11% on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q2 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, it\u2019s worth noting that we had a particularly strong Q2 last year with revenue growing 125% after a week Q2 of 2020. Second, the macroenvironment remains challenging, including supply chain issues and inflation exacerbated by the conflict in Europe. It\u2019s unclear how long these conditions will persist. Third, we continue to monitor the impact of higher CPAs. In general, we believe that higher pricing has multiple drivers, including industry-wide dynamics and recent trends in our user base. In Q1, we observed that higher pricing lower budget utilization for a subset of our U.S. small and medium sized advertisers \u2013 small and medium sized advertisers that are more price sensitive. We believe that advertisers who value what makes Pinterest unique, namely our users planning mindset, our positive platform, our insights-based media buying and our unique audience of commercial intent users will find value on our platform using our automated bidding products. Finally, our investment in building a native content ecosystem will likely remain a mid single digit headwind to revenue. However, we believe that this effort will both be engagement and revenue accretive over time. Finally, I want to touch on expenses. We expect the second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at 10% quarter-over-quarter as we push some of the spend from Q1 into Q2 and beyond. We plan to continue to scale our investments and our native content ecosystem, the core Pinner experience and headcount across research and development and sales and marketing, but timing could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We also plan to push our Q2 brand marketing campaign to start towards the end of Q3 and into Q4 this year. For the full year, we plan to invest in our growth initiatives. Layering in some of the benefits and under spend for Q1 and recognizing that this is a competitive hiring environment, we are expecting non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the range of 35% to 40% year-over-year. Thanks to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, we can open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hi, guys. Two questions on the MAU trajectory. For Ben, I guess, why hasn\u2019t search traffic recovered? And are we going to basically have to wait until you lap the negative effects from fall of 2021 for that to start to pick up? And I guess just stepping back of all these initiatives you guys are working on, what are you most excited about that can help drive engagement over the long-term? And then the second one for Todd, just kind of nitpicky, but any additional color you can provide on both global and U.S. MAUs, like why they declined from the Feb 1 intra-quarter update you provided last quarter until the end of the quarter? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: I\u2019ll get started, Ross, and then turn it over to Todd. We\u2019ve discussed in the past that search has always been an important channel for us, especially in bringing in brand-new users, and for users that engage periodically it brings them back into the service. So Google is often making changes to their algorithm. And entering Q1, we started to lower baseline than we would have absent the algorithm updates in November 2021, when we had few resurrection from research in February and March that we typically see. Now this quarter, we chose to take a different strategy than we have in times of past. So rather than playing a short game, we really invested in protecting our long-term opportunity and search. For example, when you visit Pinterest now compared to a few months ago, the experience is a lot more open, meaning you can explore the whole service, you can explore different pins without prompting you to sign up, and we allow you to dismiss that prompt. Todd mentioned that that caused some modest declines in MAUs in the short-term, but we think it\u2019s the right long-term strategy. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been testing internationally and results in higher activation rates and more sign-ups over the medium to long term. So we\u2019re proactively investing in better relevance. And then the other question you asked is what are the other things that we\u2019re doing that we\u2019re excited about to drive long-term growth and there are a few that I mentioned. The first one that I mentioned, which isn\u2019t a brand new feature, but it\u2019s the thing that Pinners fundamentally come to Pinterest for is we continue to invest in the quality of the recommendations and search results and I\u2019m really proud of the team that they improved both in the last quarter. On the recommendation quality, we saw better engagement with native video content, better recommendations overall. And in search, we began to introduce new features such as structured search for things like recipes that will expand it in new verticals. And what we\u2019re seeing from those is an increase in search query volume and a resulting increase in engagement. So it\u2019s kind of one pillar, and think of that as improving the core. The second thing we\u2019re doing is we continue to invest in bringing on more native content on to Pinterest. And this has been a big investment for us over the last 12 to 18 months. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team. They stood up this entire ecosystem, essentially from scratch. And we\u2019re starting to see really great traction there. There are significant increases in both the number of creators that are adding Idea Pins, the amount of video Idea Pins that are being consumed. And we continue to see that Pinners, who follow more of those creators to visit more often. Now we\u2019re building this ecosystem into a much larger population base. So we described that as a headwind in the near-term, but early signs are that we\u2019re getting traction there. And this is also strategically important because we think video as a format is just fundamental to the way people get inspired and take action in the future. Finally, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk about it more on the call, but we continue to invest in shopping. We talked a little bit about improving the quality of content, and we released the Pinterest API. We\u2019ve begun beta testing, Your Shop. And then finally, we\u2019ll be testing and expanding the test of checkout. And all of those bring more utility to the platform, which we think in turn are both revenue and engagement accretive investments. Todd?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, Ross, I think the second part of your question was what happened to MAUs from the Feb 1 intra-quarter update we gave on the last earnings call through the end of the quarter. And just for \u2013 just to kind of reset from Feb 1 to March 31st, the U.S. declined from 86.6 million monthly active users to 85.2 million, and global MAUs declined from 436.8 million to 433.3 million. In the U.S., the decline was really due to three things. One was, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, especially on the last call, lower traffic from search. Historically, we\u2019ve seen new user sign-ups, and resurrections typically tick up in the months of February and March. And we just didn\u2019t see that happen in the first quarter, we think, because of the impact of the search algo change from Q4. The second was Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and we talked about this a little bit at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns that during periods where there are other large news events going on, people often turn away from inspiration and planning behavior toward real-time news updates that they find on other services. And then lastly, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about competition. The U.S. is our most mature market, and we see a lot of social media, entertainment and news apps competing for user time spent. Globally, the decline was due to lower engagement in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe. And we think based on our estimates that, that was about a 5 million global MAU impacts. So had it not been for those events, we think our global MAUs would have been modestly up from the Feb 1 MAU number that we shared. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.\nNeil Doshi: Next question operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, you called out some of the macro volatility that we saw in results around the war in Eastern Europe, any greater color you could give about the depth of pullback from advertising spend, or how volatile it was as the quarter came to an end, and whether you\u2019re still seeing sustained weakness as we move into Q2. That would be a question number one. And then to the comment \u2013 and then Todd just bought it back again with respect to video-centric apps and what impact it might be having on usage. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing as you think of it as a direct correlation of people spending more time on video-centric maybe versus your engagement? And how do you think your product road map positions you better competitively vis-\u00e0-vis those video-centric products over the medium term? Thanks.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So Eric, I can take the first part, and I\u2019ll probably ask Ben to step in on the second part of the video-centric apps question. But in terms of demand and volatility, it definitely wasn\u2019t helpful to us in terms of monthly active users. As I talked about, we had probably a 5 million monthly active user impact. And it also had knock-on effects to advertising spend around the world, but in particular, in Europe. I don\u2019t know when that conflict will resolve, but it\u2019s definitely a period of uncertainty that\u2019s not helpful. We\u2019ve seen, in addition, a fair amount of weakness that we\u2019ve called out over time in the consumer packaged goods, or CPG space, driven we think by supply chain pressures and inflation, as I called out. So the combination of those things has not been good for brand building in this environment. But we hope that once that resolves and we start to see some of the supply chain issues abate that we\u2019ll see a recovery in some of that demand.\nBen Silbermann: Yes, Eric, to your second question on competition in video, so we called out competition just because there is a tremendous amount of options for consumers on the phone at any given time. And we look at the same data that all externals do. That said, we think that what we\u2019ve heard from Pinners and what we see is that we have a pretty differentiated use case. I mean that\u2019s the use case of actually using Pinterest to plan, get ready for major events and then eventually to make considered purchases. And that\u2019s quite different from an entertainment and news use case. Now, the way you characterize the question was kind of video versus not, we think video is going to be a fundamental medium for all kinds of activities like from entertainment to news to education. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made this investment in building out on a native content ecosystem. This was kind of a long bet that we started 18 months ago, but if you were just to fast forward to the future, we think the Pinterest is undoubtedly just a more engaging and richer surface. If you can shop with video, if you can get new ideas that are part of video. And a lot of our core use cases are already seeing the benefits from having more video content on board. So we\u2019re going to continue to make that investment. We think that enhances the core value proposition of going from inspiration and all the way to realization. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve gone long on that investment as the company.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sheridan. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you. I just want to ask one question about shopping. That data point you provide about the number of Pinners engaging and shopping services growing year-over-year. That seems to be \u2013 things seem to be going in the right direction for you. How long is the path to getting to the kind of the shopping experience that you\u2019ve envisioned that you\u2019ve liked to see on Pinterest and what are the remaining things you need to do to create that experience? Thank you.\nBen Silbermann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. I\u2019ve been really proud of the team for continuing to make progress in shopping. And we\u2019ve talked about this three-pronged strategy. The first has been, we really want to improve the quality of inventory. So the journey that we\u2019ve been on started with a verified merchant program, it expanded to letting people upload catalogs and then multi-feed. This quarter, we expanded that to include a Pinterest API for shopping as well as a partnership with WooCommerce that gives millions of merchants, the power to turn their product catalogs into shoppable product Pins. All of that is just this fundamental baseline investment that we need, but already this quarter, what you can see is if you start looking at the product pages, not only is the data up-to-date, but we\u2019re keeping it up-to-date in real-time and that gives people confidence to purchase. The second part of that strategy is improving the discoverability of that. So we\u2019ve talked in the past about surfacing shopping results and things like search, using computer vision technology to match products to all of the seen images. I think the next big milestone for us will be taking Your Shop, which is a personalized shopping surface out of beta, which is how it\u2019s being tested today and into kind of the market in more mainstream way. And then finally, we continue to test seamless checkout with more and more merchants. We think that for long considered items, people are less sensitive to having one tap checkout. If it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been thinking about for months, but over the long run, we think this is going to be a fundamental expectation. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re pursuing that strategy. I\u2019m happy with the progress. We have a ways to go. I think that there\u2019s a company up in Seattle, that\u2019s been continuing to prove shopping experience for literally decades. But we think what Pinterest brings is that ability to discover products without necessarily knowing the exact name of that product and using your taste and preferences to connect you to products that help you get something done in real life.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks Ben.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Mahaney. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I got two. One, just sort of macro, obviously inflation, fears growing sort of recession Europe even U.S. sort of certainly growing concerns and e-com slowing and just \u2013 I guess, just what are you seeing on the ground in terms of as you sort of push much more aggressively into shopping and make that experience better, how does the sort of kind of retail spending outlook, you think impact you as you look out, especially as you move into Q2 and even into, back to school in Q3. And then sort of just a big picture question on the creator side, you\u2019re obviously doing a lot to sort of create on-platform content that\u2019s unique and you\u2019ve obviously hired Malik and pushing into the creator economy. When you talk about competition because I think you\u2019ve mentioned it a couple times already, is that mostly TikTok? Is that Instagram like where are you seeing most of that competition? Is there any way to sort of isolate where you\u2019re losing time spent mostly to in that sort of work for time?\nTodd Morgenfeld: So Rich, I can take the first part of your question on market dynamics, inflation, recession supply chain, all of that stuff, as it relates to the retail outlook, and then maybe Ben can weigh in on the creator side. So, first of all, we saw particular strength last quarter in the retail advertising market, we saw more pressure on CPG advertisers due to supply chain pressures, inflation, et cetera. And we were \u2013 we benefited significantly from strength in retail. And I would imagine that based on what we\u2019re seeing, that that will continue. The reason I have confidence that it will continue is that our progress in signing joint business partnerships, which I think we\u2019ve described in the past that we call them JBPs but they\u2019re not contracts to spend, but their indications of intent to spend, the number of those large deals that we signed in particular with retailers grew 35% in terms of raw number year-over-year in the first quarter. And the dollar amounts indicated by those agreements grew 55% year-over-year in the first quarter. So that suggests not only strength last quarter in the retail segment, which showed up in the results, but also an indication of willingness to continue to spend. Ben, would you like to weigh in on the creator side?\nBen Silbermann: Yes, Rich. I mean, I think the way that I interpreted your question is, if you\u2019re losing time spent, where is it going to, and we don\u2019t have exact fidelity into where people are spending their time, but obviously the story of the last couple years in terms of time shift has been the rise of TikTok is a major place that people are spending their time. Now on Pinterest end, what we\u2019re really trying to establish the creators is a place where they can publish content and they\u2019re rewarded for that content\u2019s ability to inspire action rather than the raw entertainment value of that. And that\u2019s going to have to be reflected in the way that we provide incentives for creators, but also the way that we rank content on Pinterest. So the reason that a feed on Pinterest feels different than a feed on a social network or a feed on a pure entertainment network is that the content is ranked, taking into account, how useful that idea will be to getting something done in the future. As we think about things like creator rewards and roll out new ad formats, like Idea Pins that are sponsored that\u2019s the sort of central thesis behind it. And it\u2019s in line with the central thesis of Pinterest overall, where this isn\u2019t a platform to talk to your friends. It\u2019s not a platform to keep up with the news. It\u2019s a platform for you to articulate things that you want to do in your life for us to help you visualize what that end state looks like. And then for us to give us the planning tools and the shopping tools to turn that vision into reality. We think creators can play a positive role all the way across that inspiration to realization journey.\nRich Greenfield: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Greenfield. The next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. A couple, Todd, you\u2019ve given a lot of metrics suggesting users are somewhat stabilizing especially on mobile. When does that mobile crossover happen or are you trying to kind of signal that we\u2019re nearing the bottom, maybe this summer. And then second, just on the onsite shopping test, are you seeing better conversion or better monetization of usage when people do onsite shopping? Thank you.\nTodd Morgenfeld: So, Justin, I think the question you\u2019re trying to get at is really around guidance, then I want to be careful that we\u2019re not providing guidance and there are a few things to note around that. In my opening remarks, I called out the second quarter as our weakest quarter, typically as people head to summer, a lot of times you\u2019re spending more time outside and less time on Pinterest because you\u2019re doing instead of planning. It was interesting to note in Google\u2019s a call yesterday that travel searches in the first quarter were above Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which suggests that we may see that even more so in the month of June going into the summer this year. And so I also want to make sure that we reminded folks of the way we calculate our MAUs. It\u2019s on a 30 day look back from the last day of the quarter. And so our Q2 MAUs will be calculated based on June data, which is seasonally weaker month for us, as people start heading out probably on vacations and we\u2019ve seen that trend historically. Haven\u2019t really gotten into a lot of seasonality with in-quarters because it\u2019s a little noisy, but we wanted to give people these intra-quarter updates over the last couple of years to just give you a sense of what we\u2019re seeing in real-time. And then the last point was that we\u2019re still facing this year-over-year growth headwind from the search algorithm change that happened in the fourth quarter and the threat of potential new headwinds from future algo changes, which is hard for us to predict in terms of timing. And the competition for time spent on competing video centric platforms is something we pay close attention to.\nBen Silbermann: Yes. Justin, I think your second question was how are we seeing shopping? We\u2019ve known for a long time that Pinners have a lot of commercial intent and they bring that intent to Pinterest. And what we\u2019ve seen is that as we remove barriers to people executing that intent by linking them to products, by ensuring those products are in stock, that the prices are accurate, their purchasing behavior increases. And so our core strategy has been around increasing that inventory, making the matching more efficient and then eventually streamlining that conversion event at the end. But those first two are really fundamental. And then we think creators in social shopping, they can be a bonus on top of that by giving people more confidence in their ability to buy. And we\u2019ve seen some great early signs both with Pinterest TV as well as with partnerships. We had one this quarter with Victor and Rolf, which was a new fragrance, we paired them up with a creator. Showing really good business results because at the end of the day, they\u2019re giving Pinners with commercial intent the confidence they need to eventually make that purchase.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you, Ben. Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Post. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Simone for Mark. We wanted to ask, I guess, two questions. The first one on like quarter to date trends, like revenue haven\u2019t necessarily seemed reflective over the overall quarter for everyone. And we wanted to know are there any ebbs and flows like beyond Ukraine for how to think about the rest of the second quarter for revenue? And if we\u2019re giving \u2013 how much room maybe we\u2019re giving for uncertainty around macro there? And then the second question, if you could elaborate more on, you\u2019ve talked about how you\u2019ve pushed up your creator spend, but any expectations around that and what you\u2019re looking for there?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. I can take the first question on the quarter to date revenue piece, and then maybe Ben can weigh in on the creator side. I know others have called out intra quarter trends on revenue. What I would say is that our guidance for the quarter, we said, we anticipate growing about 11% year-over-year. That reflects our best judgment of where we\u2019ll land this quarter. And so we look at a number of factors internally to gauge that. But we\u2019re not calling out any other \u2013 I think others have called for deceleration or have other factors kind of weighed in. Our best judgment is we\u2019re going to land at roughly 11% growth. And that\u2019s kind of everything that we see about business to date and our outlook.\nBen Silbermann: And Simone, I wanted to make sure that I understood the intent of your question. You mentioned kind of our trend on creator spending. Was that \u2013 is that right?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nBen Silbermann: Yes. I think we might have mentioned earlier, we did have some creator marketing spend that we pushed out from the beginning of the year to the back half of the year as we continue to learn kind of really what works with creators and how do we create incentives that give them kind of the motivation to create content that\u2019s really useful. And often content that\u2019s a lot more evergreen than the kind of ephemeral content you see on a lot of other platforms. That\u2019s a pretty different mindset for a lot of the creators that are on competing platforms that are essentially rewarded on a combination of volume and entertainment value versus the ability to inspire action. So a tutorial that might help you teach something and is just as relevant as it searched a year from now, as it was on the day it\u2019s posted. So we\u2019re still in early experiments with exactly how to do that that\u2019s part of the reason that we pushed out some of that spend. But that doesn\u2019t reflect a lack of conviction in our investment around initiative.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Neeraj on for Doug. So just a couple of questions. One is, if you could help us frame the performance of brand versus DR spending during 1Q? And how it\u2019s trending quarter to date and anything else on verticals? Also, you guys lowered expense outlook from 40% \u2013 to 35% to 40%. Where is that coming from?\nTodd Morgenfeld: Sure. So in terms of brand versus performance, we\u2019ve talked historically about being a majority performance based advertising in terms of our mix versus brand. And there\u2019s no change in that. I would say that the one read through on the weakness we\u2019ve been experiencing, especially in CPG, which is I think an industry-wide kind of supply chain inflation driven phenomenon that disproportionately impacts brand. But we\u2019re still seeing growth across objectives. So that\u2019s part one. And then on the lowered expense side, our ambition is to invest in the long-term. We set out a bunch of priorities earlier in the year that we communicated on the last call and for a number of reasons that we talked about earlier slower than desired growth in hiring, some delays in our creator spend, as Ben mentioned a moment ago and then lower in office spend in the first quarter among a few other items. We just got off to a little bit of a slower start in ramping our spend, even though our OpEx grew 31% year-over-year up 4 points on a year-over basis \u2013 year-over-year basis from the fourth quarter. We also grew our head count 27% year-over-year, which is at the same rate that we grew head count on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re hiring aggressively. We\u2019re spending against our strategic priorities and we set the bar really high for the year and got off to a little bit slower start than we anticipated. We will catch up on some of that spend as the year unfolds, but not all the way to the full amount that we had intended to spend in the first quarter, which is why we brought the guidance down to 35% to 40% for the year.\nNeil Doshi: And operator, we\u2019ll take one last question.\nOperator: Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. I do apologize, one moment. Brian, your line is now open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thank you. Two quick ones, maybe follow-up on the shopping API, I\u2019m sorry if we missed it. But did you give us any color on kind of the penetration dynamics there? Is it accelerating? What kind of portion of people are testing there? What kind of size tests are they doing? Maybe even any color on verticals that are using it more so than others. And then on the headcount hiring and kind of the \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was a pause. It was just \u2013 it was lighter than expected in Q1. Can you give us any color on the dynamics there? Is it competitive and candidates are kind of pricing themselves out of your threshold or anything on the headcount color.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. Brian, why don\u2019t I start with the second part and we\u2019ll come back to the first question in a second. So we had a pretty aggressive desired ramp in head count leading into the year. And we have done a great job in hiring. I think we\u2019re still very competitive for talent, but we set the bar really high to scale our team. And as you know, in the industry right now, it\u2019s very competitive for talent, especially in the Bay Area, which is why we started to build hubs for talent in other geographies, Toronto, Mexico city and Poland, which we think will be an opportunity for us to diversify the sources of talent and bring on a broader group of people to build a great product. So we\u2019re doing I think the right things there. But what you shouldn\u2019t expect from us is to be in disciplined around hiring and uneconomic or unfair terms. So we want to balance our ambition to staff the team as aggressively as we need to deliver the product that we want to build over the next few years. But we don\u2019t want to do that in a reckless way.\nBen Silbermann: And on shopping, you can think of the shopping API as kind of the next generation of our catalog uploader. So it\u2019s very much in line with our desire to get as much up to date and accurate information. And then we apply machine learning to rationalize all of those products and then computer vision to match them up against the scenes. So, we\u2019re seeing really good early uptake. It\u2019s been a learning process as we\u2019ve gone from single feed upload to multi-feed upload, now to a proper API. And we continue to see \u2013 we plan to see continued improvement in the quality of inventory, which in turn kind of enables people to go from that inspiration to purchasing experience, which is fundamental to our mission as a company.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Excellent. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: There are no other questions. Thank you. I would now pass it back to Ben Silbermann for any closing remarks.\nBen Silbermann: Well, I just wanted to thank everyone for the thoughtful questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue open. I know it\u2019s a busy afternoon for a lot of industries, so enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes the Pinterest first quarter 2022 earnings call. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks Ben, I'll share some further details on the trends that we saw in the first quarter and provide a preliminary outlook for Q2. Beginning this quarter, we're providing additional disclosure around our revenue, our monthly active users or MAUs, our average revenue per user or ARPU by presenting the U.S. and Canada, Europe and rest of world separately. As our international operations become a more meaningful part of our business. We want to provide additional detail in those regions. Please refer to our earnings presentation for the new geographic breakouts. As part of this change, we re-categorize the U.S. into the U.S. and Canada. Please note that there is little difference in historical year-over-year and sequential growth rates for the U.S. alone versus the U.S. and Canada together. We're categorizing these two regions together going forward because they're both relatively mature and they share a similar advertiser base. Furthermore, while we've provided U.S. monthly active users recognized revenue and ARPU for Q1. Going forward, we plan to only report these metrics for the new combined U.S. and Canada. Turning to our financial performance. Q1 revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $575 million, in line with our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $77 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13%. Most of the details on our quarterly performance can be found in our shareholder letter, but I wanted to provide you with some additional specific. As our international business has grown, we're becoming more subject to currency fluctuations. Revenue growth from Europe was 27% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth in Europe would have been approximately 34% year-over-year. And as we continued the distribution and placement of Idea Pins, we believe this negatively impacted our first quarter year-over-year revenue growth in the mid single-digits on a percentage basis similar to the prior two quarters. This impact was factored into our guidance for the first quarter. Turning to expenses. We accelerated our non-GAAP operating expense growth in the first quarter to 31% year-over-year versus 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, sequentially, our non-GAAP OpEx declined 1% due to pushing off creator-related spend, slower hiring than we anticipated, particularly in the bay area and a few other favorable items. Before getting into some specific trends on user engagement in the quarter, I want to double click on our strategy to combat engagement headwinds. As Ben mentioned, we're looking at ways to drive more sustainable user acquisition and retention. For example, we're making Pinterest more browsable without immediately requiring users to sign up when they land on the site. While this had a modest negative impact on global new user signups initially, we believe that removing barriers for longer browsing sessions can drive more activations over time. We also believe our investments in the core Pinner experience on home feed, search and shopping can make Pinterest feel more personal and relevant in the near to medium term. And that our investments in creator-led native content and short form videos can bend the curve on engagement in the long run. With respect to our Q1 engagement trends, it's worth noting that our global mobile app MAUs, which account for the significant majority of our impressions and revenue grew in the mid single digits year-over-year. Mobile app MAUs in the U.S. and Canada were also relatively resilient, declining around 6% year-over-year versus down 31% year-over-year for web-based MAUs. Sequentially, U.S. and Canada mobile app MAUs were flat. Our younger Gen Z users were also a source of strength growing mid single digits year-over-year. Finally, shopping engagement remained relatively resilient with the number of Pinners engaging and shopping surfaces is growing year-over-year. Turning to our preliminary outlook for Q2. While we typically don't provide MAU guidance, for the last three quarters, we've shared a quarter to date snapshot of MAUs in our earnings. As of April 25, U.S. and Canada MAUs were at 94 million and global MAUs were 432.9 million. We've provided intra quarter data points on MAUs over the last few quarters because the lifting of pandemic lockdowns in 2021 disrupted our seasonal \u2013 our typical seasonal engagement patterns and limited visibility into quarterly MAU trends. Lockdowns began to lift for some geographies in mid-March 2021, which is when we began to see year-over-year engagement declines. Engagement continued to normalize toward pre-COVID levels throughout Q2 2021 as more geos lifted COVID restrictions. We believe that the pandemic unwind will no longer create a year-over-year MAU headwind in the third quarter of this year. So we don't plan on providing an intra quarter update on MAUs going forward. As you think about MAUs for Q2, I'd like to provide you with some additional context. Q2 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter for MAUs, given that people tend to be outside more, travel more and engage in our core use cases less often. As a reminder, at the end of the quarter we calculate MAUs based on a 30 day look back from the last month of each quarter. Since June is one of our weaker months for engagement in the U.S., a snapshot of MAUs on April 25 may not predict June MAUs. And finally, we continue to face year-over-year growth headwinds from the search algorithm change that happened in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as potential new headwinds from future search algorithm updates the timing of which are hard to predict. On the revenue side, we expect Q2 revenue to grow around 11% on a percentage basis year-over-year. Please note that our Q2 revenue guide takes into account a few considerations. First, it's worth noting that we had a particularly strong Q2 last year with revenue growing 125% after a week Q2 of 2020. Second, the macroenvironment remains challenging, including supply chain issues and inflation exacerbated by the conflict in Europe. It's unclear how long these conditions will persist. Third, we continue to monitor the impact of higher CPAs. In general, we believe that higher pricing has multiple drivers, including industry-wide dynamics and recent trends in our user base. In Q1, we observed that higher pricing lower budget utilization for a subset of our U.S. small and medium sized advertisers \u2013 small and medium sized advertisers that are more price sensitive. We believe that advertisers who value what makes Pinterest unique, namely our users planning mindset, our positive platform, our insights-based media buying and our unique audience of commercial intent users will find value on our platform using our automated bidding products. Finally, our investment in building a native content ecosystem will likely remain a mid single digit headwind to revenue. However, we believe that this effort will both be engagement and revenue accretive over time. Finally, I want to touch on expenses. We expect the second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at 10% quarter-over-quarter as we push some of the spend from Q1 into Q2 and beyond. We plan to continue to scale our investments and our native content ecosystem, the core Pinner experience and headcount across research and development and sales and marketing, but timing could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We also plan to push our Q2 brand marketing campaign to start towards the end of Q3 and into Q4 this year. For the full year, we plan to invest in our growth initiatives. Layering in some of the benefits and under spend for Q1 and recognizing that this is a competitive hiring environment, we are expecting non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the range of 35% to 40% year-over-year. Thanks to our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, our creators and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open it up for questions. Yes, Ross, I think the second part of your question was what happened to MAUs from the Feb 1 intra-quarter update we gave on the last earnings call through the end of the quarter. And just for \u2013 just to kind of reset from Feb 1 to March 31st, the U.S. declined from 86.6 million monthly active users to 85.2 million, and global MAUs declined from 436.8 million to 433.3 million. In the U.S., the decline was really due to three things. One was, as we've talked about in the past, especially on the last call, lower traffic from search. Historically, we've seen new user sign-ups, and resurrections typically tick up in the months of February and March. And we just didn't see that happen in the first quarter, we think, because of the impact of the search algo change from Q4. The second was Russia's invasion of Ukraine and we talked about this a little bit at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns that during periods where there are other large news events going on, people often turn away from inspiration and planning behavior toward real-time news updates that they find on other services. And then lastly, we've talked a little bit about competition. The U.S. is our most mature market, and we see a lot of social media, entertainment and news apps competing for user time spent. Globally, the decline was due to lower engagement in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe. And we think based on our estimates that, that was about a 5 million global MAU impacts. So had it not been for those events, we think our global MAUs would have been modestly up from the Feb 1 MAU number that we shared. So hopefully, that's helpful. So Eric, I can take the first part, and I'll probably ask Ben to step in on the second part of the video-centric apps question. But in terms of demand and volatility, it definitely wasn't helpful to us in terms of monthly active users. As I talked about, we had probably a 5 million monthly active user impact. And it also had knock-on effects to advertising spend around the world, but in particular, in Europe. I don't know when that conflict will resolve, but it's definitely a period of uncertainty that's not helpful. We've seen, in addition, a fair amount of weakness that we've called out over time in the consumer packaged goods, or CPG space, driven we think by supply chain pressures and inflation, as I called out. So the combination of those things has not been good for brand building in this environment. But we hope that once that resolves and we start to see some of the supply chain issues abate that we'll see a recovery in some of that demand. So Rich, I can take the first part of your question on market dynamics, inflation, recession supply chain, all of that stuff, as it relates to the retail outlook, and then maybe Ben can weigh in on the creator side. So, first of all, we saw particular strength last quarter in the retail advertising market, we saw more pressure on CPG advertisers due to supply chain pressures, inflation, et cetera. And we were \u2013 we benefited significantly from strength in retail. And I would imagine that based on what we're seeing, that that will continue. The reason I have confidence that it will continue is that our progress in signing joint business partnerships, which I think we've described in the past that we call them JBPs but they're not contracts to spend, but their indications of intent to spend, the number of those large deals that we signed in particular with retailers grew 35% in terms of raw number year-over-year in the first quarter. And the dollar amounts indicated by those agreements grew 55% year-over-year in the first quarter. So that suggests not only strength last quarter in the retail segment, which showed up in the results, but also an indication of willingness to continue to spend. Ben, would you like to weigh in on the creator side? So, Justin, I think the question you're trying to get at is really around guidance, then I want to be careful that we're not providing guidance and there are a few things to note around that. In my opening remarks, I called out the second quarter as our weakest quarter, typically as people head to summer, a lot of times you're spending more time outside and less time on Pinterest because you're doing instead of planning. It was interesting to note in Google's a call yesterday that travel searches in the first quarter were above Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which suggests that we may see that even more so in the month of June going into the summer this year. And so I also want to make sure that we reminded folks of the way we calculate our MAUs. It's on a 30 day look back from the last day of the quarter. And so our Q2 MAUs will be calculated based on June data, which is seasonally weaker month for us, as people start heading out probably on vacations and we've seen that trend historically. Haven't really gotten into a lot of seasonality with in-quarters because it's a little noisy, but we wanted to give people these intra-quarter updates over the last couple of years to just give you a sense of what we're seeing in real-time. And then the last point was that we're still facing this year-over-year growth headwind from the search algorithm change that happened in the fourth quarter and the threat of potential new headwinds from future algo changes, which is hard for us to predict in terms of timing. And the competition for time spent on competing video centric platforms is something we pay close attention to. Sure. I can take the first question on the quarter to date revenue piece, and then maybe Ben can weigh in on the creator side. I know others have called out intra quarter trends on revenue. What I would say is that our guidance for the quarter, we said, we anticipate growing about 11% year-over-year. That reflects our best judgment of where we'll land this quarter. And so we look at a number of factors internally to gauge that. But we're not calling out any other \u2013 I think others have called for deceleration or have other factors kind of weighed in. Our best judgment is we're going to land at roughly 11% growth. And that's kind of everything that we see about business to date and our outlook. Sure. So in terms of brand versus performance, we've talked historically about being a majority performance based advertising in terms of our mix versus brand. And there's no change in that. I would say that the one read through on the weakness we've been experiencing, especially in CPG, which is I think an industry-wide kind of supply chain inflation driven phenomenon that disproportionately impacts brand. But we're still seeing growth across objectives. So that's part one. And then on the lowered expense side, our ambition is to invest in the long-term. We set out a bunch of priorities earlier in the year that we communicated on the last call and for a number of reasons that we talked about earlier slower than desired growth in hiring, some delays in our creator spend, as Ben mentioned a moment ago and then lower in office spend in the first quarter among a few other items. We just got off to a little bit of a slower start in ramping our spend, even though our OpEx grew 31% year-over-year up 4 points on a year-over basis \u2013 year-over-year basis from the fourth quarter. We also grew our head count 27% year-over-year, which is at the same rate that we grew head count on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. So we're hiring aggressively. We're spending against our strategic priorities and we set the bar really high for the year and got off to a little bit slower start than we anticipated. We will catch up on some of that spend as the year unfolds, but not all the way to the full amount that we had intended to spend in the first quarter, which is why we brought the guidance down to 35% to 40% for the year. Yes. Brian, why don't I start with the second part and we'll come back to the first question in a second. So we had a pretty aggressive desired ramp in head count leading into the year. And we have done a great job in hiring. I think we're still very competitive for talent, but we set the bar really high to scale our team. And as you know, in the industry right now, it's very competitive for talent, especially in the Bay Area, which is why we started to build hubs for talent in other geographies, Toronto, Mexico city and Poland, which we think will be an opportunity for us to diversify the sources of talent and bring on a broader group of people to build a great product. So we're doing I think the right things there. But what you shouldn't expect from us is to be in disciplined around hiring and uneconomic or unfair terms. So we want to balance our ambition to staff the team as aggressively as we need to deliver the product that we want to build over the next few years. But we don't want to do that in a reckless way."

            "name": "Ben Silbermann",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call. We'll open up with some comments and then take your questions. But just before we get started, I wanted to express on behalf of our entire company, that are hard to continue to go out to all those impacted by what's happening in Ukraine. We have members of our team who lived in the region and are now thankfully safe. And I'm proud of how our company came together to support humanitarian efforts for Ukrainians. We'll continue to keep everyone affected in our thoughts during this unimaginable time. Turning to the business. A few minutes ago, we released our Q1 shareholder letter. Revenue was strong with 18% year-over-year growth to $575 million. This was due to strength from retail advertisers, our international business and our managed SMB advertisers, all of which offset the economic weakness we're seeing in CPG and in Europe because of the war. Meanwhile, we continue to face engagement headwinds. We had 433 million global monthly active users, down 9% compared to Q1 last year, a quarter that was driven by pandemic-influenced growth. We also felt the impacts of lower traffic from search and time spent by people on competitive platforms. We're doing a number of things to improve the Pinner experience and tackle engagement headwinds head on. In the near-term, we're applying sophisticated machine learning to every aspects of our platform. As a result, we've seen marked improvements in the relevance of home feed recommendations, the quality of search results and engagement with notifications. All of these enhance the quality of our platform for Pinners, and are leading indicators of deeper user engagement. We also plan to launch a global brand awareness and comprehension marketing campaign starting in Q3. In the medium-term, we continue to invest in a rich content ecosystem with publishing tools that allow creators to publish rich lifestyle content on to Pinterest and we're also allowing people to take the content they find and create on Pinterest and share that inspiration with their friends, family and followers across the Internet. To do this well, we're also working to connect Pinners with the most inspirational creators and native content in dynamic formats like short-term video. As we've discussed in past calls, this investment has come at the cost of some MAUs in the short term as we get the ecosystem off the ground. But we're committed to this strategy because we believe it will drive engagement over time and because we believe that native content in video, in particular, is fundamental to help the people get inspiration and shop in the future. In 2021, I'm especially proud of our teams that laid the foundation for a native content ecosystem. It's gaining traction. The number of video idea Pinners is up 15x year-over-year, and this content is resonating with more and more people as we continue to see that Pinners, who follow multiple creators, visit Pinterest more often compared to those who do not. We plan to continue building new publishing tools with the help of our new acquisition, VOCHI, so creators can make even better content, content that's not only entertaining, but help us move our user base from inspiration all the way to action, content we're saving. We're also expanding rewards to bring on more inspirational creators to Pinterest. Finally, we continue invest in making Pinterest a shopping destination and we've taken some big steps here. We launched the Pinterest API for shopping to help merchants and give Pinners a real-time information about the products they see from pricing to availability. We also started beta testing Your Shop, which uses our unique ability to understand taste and preferences, to deliver an experience for each Pinner that's personalized to them. This work is fundamental to our vision. So users can not only come to Pinterest with the expectation of being inspired but also know that they can turn those inspirations into a reality with purchases. Across the board, we continue to make progress in helping Pinners go from the spark of inspiration through to buying, making, trying, and doing. We're confident that our strategy will deliver great results for Pinners, creators, advertisers, merchants into our business. And we remain excited about the enormous opportunity to help people live a life they truly love. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to give you more color into the business. I'll get started, Ross, and then turn it over to Todd. We've discussed in the past that search has always been an important channel for us, especially in bringing in brand-new users, and for users that engage periodically it brings them back into the service. So Google is often making changes to their algorithm. And entering Q1, we started to lower baseline than we would have absent the algorithm updates in November 2021, when we had few resurrection from research in February and March that we typically see. Now this quarter, we chose to take a different strategy than we have in times of past. So rather than playing a short game, we really invested in protecting our long-term opportunity and search. For example, when you visit Pinterest now compared to a few months ago, the experience is a lot more open, meaning you can explore the whole service, you can explore different pins without prompting you to sign up, and we allow you to dismiss that prompt. Todd mentioned that that caused some modest declines in MAUs in the short-term, but we think it's the right long-term strategy. It's one that we've been testing internationally and results in higher activation rates and more sign-ups over the medium to long term. So we're proactively investing in better relevance. And then the other question you asked is what are the other things that we're doing that we're excited about to drive long-term growth and there are a few that I mentioned. The first one that I mentioned, which isn't a brand new feature, but it's the thing that Pinners fundamentally come to Pinterest for is we continue to invest in the quality of the recommendations and search results and I'm really proud of the team that they improved both in the last quarter. On the recommendation quality, we saw better engagement with native video content, better recommendations overall. And in search, we began to introduce new features such as structured search for things like recipes that will expand it in new verticals. And what we're seeing from those is an increase in search query volume and a resulting increase in engagement. So it's kind of one pillar, and think of that as improving the core. The second thing we're doing is we continue to invest in bringing on more native content on to Pinterest. And this has been a big investment for us over the last 12 to 18 months. I'm incredibly proud of the team. They stood up this entire ecosystem, essentially from scratch. And we're starting to see really great traction there. There are significant increases in both the number of creators that are adding Idea Pins, the amount of video Idea Pins that are being consumed. And we continue to see that Pinners, who follow more of those creators to visit more often. Now we're building this ecosystem into a much larger population base. So we described that as a headwind in the near-term, but early signs are that we're getting traction there. And this is also strategically important because we think video as a format is just fundamental to the way people get inspired and take action in the future. Finally, I'm sure we'll talk about it more on the call, but we continue to invest in shopping. We talked a little bit about improving the quality of content, and we released the Pinterest API. We've begun beta testing, Your Shop. And then finally, we'll be testing and expanding the test of checkout. And all of those bring more utility to the platform, which we think in turn are both revenue and engagement accretive investments. Todd? Yes, Eric, to your second question on competition in video, so we called out competition just because there is a tremendous amount of options for consumers on the phone at any given time. And we look at the same data that all externals do. That said, we think that what we've heard from Pinners and what we see is that we have a pretty differentiated use case. I mean that's the use case of actually using Pinterest to plan, get ready for major events and then eventually to make considered purchases. And that's quite different from an entertainment and news use case. Now, the way you characterize the question was kind of video versus not, we think video is going to be a fundamental medium for all kinds of activities like from entertainment to news to education. And that's why we've made this investment in building out on a native content ecosystem. This was kind of a long bet that we started 18 months ago, but if you were just to fast forward to the future, we think the Pinterest is undoubtedly just a more engaging and richer surface. If you can shop with video, if you can get new ideas that are part of video. And a lot of our core use cases are already seeing the benefits from having more video content on board. So we're going to continue to make that investment. We think that enhances the core value proposition of going from inspiration and all the way to realization. That's why you've gone long on that investment as the company. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. I've been really proud of the team for continuing to make progress in shopping. And we've talked about this three-pronged strategy. The first has been, we really want to improve the quality of inventory. So the journey that we've been on started with a verified merchant program, it expanded to letting people upload catalogs and then multi-feed. This quarter, we expanded that to include a Pinterest API for shopping as well as a partnership with WooCommerce that gives millions of merchants, the power to turn their product catalogs into shoppable product Pins. All of that is just this fundamental baseline investment that we need, but already this quarter, what you can see is if you start looking at the product pages, not only is the data up-to-date, but we're keeping it up-to-date in real-time and that gives people confidence to purchase. The second part of that strategy is improving the discoverability of that. So we've talked in the past about surfacing shopping results and things like search, using computer vision technology to match products to all of the seen images. I think the next big milestone for us will be taking Your Shop, which is a personalized shopping surface out of beta, which is how it's being tested today and into kind of the market in more mainstream way. And then finally, we continue to test seamless checkout with more and more merchants. We think that for long considered items, people are less sensitive to having one tap checkout. If it's something you've been thinking about for months, but over the long run, we think this is going to be a fundamental expectation. And so that's how we're pursuing that strategy. I'm happy with the progress. We have a ways to go. I think that there's a company up in Seattle, that's been continuing to prove shopping experience for literally decades. But we think what Pinterest brings is that ability to discover products without necessarily knowing the exact name of that product and using your taste and preferences to connect you to products that help you get something done in real life. Yes, Rich. I mean, I think the way that I interpreted your question is, if you're losing time spent, where is it going to, and we don't have exact fidelity into where people are spending their time, but obviously the story of the last couple years in terms of time shift has been the rise of TikTok is a major place that people are spending their time. Now on Pinterest end, what we're really trying to establish the creators is a place where they can publish content and they're rewarded for that content's ability to inspire action rather than the raw entertainment value of that. And that's going to have to be reflected in the way that we provide incentives for creators, but also the way that we rank content on Pinterest. So the reason that a feed on Pinterest feels different than a feed on a social network or a feed on a pure entertainment network is that the content is ranked, taking into account, how useful that idea will be to getting something done in the future. As we think about things like creator rewards and roll out new ad formats, like Idea Pins that are sponsored that's the sort of central thesis behind it. And it's in line with the central thesis of Pinterest overall, where this isn't a platform to talk to your friends. It's not a platform to keep up with the news. It's a platform for you to articulate things that you want to do in your life for us to help you visualize what that end state looks like. And then for us to give us the planning tools and the shopping tools to turn that vision into reality. We think creators can play a positive role all the way across that inspiration to realization journey. Yes. Justin, I think your second question was how are we seeing shopping? We've known for a long time that Pinners have a lot of commercial intent and they bring that intent to Pinterest. And what we've seen is that as we remove barriers to people executing that intent by linking them to products, by ensuring those products are in stock, that the prices are accurate, their purchasing behavior increases. And so our core strategy has been around increasing that inventory, making the matching more efficient and then eventually streamlining that conversion event at the end. But those first two are really fundamental. And then we think creators in social shopping, they can be a bonus on top of that by giving people more confidence in their ability to buy. And we've seen some great early signs both with Pinterest TV as well as with partnerships. We had one this quarter with Victor and Rolf, which was a new fragrance, we paired them up with a creator. Showing really good business results because at the end of the day, they're giving Pinners with commercial intent the confidence they need to eventually make that purchase. And Simone, I wanted to make sure that I understood the intent of your question. You mentioned kind of our trend on creator spending. Was that \u2013 is that right? Yes. I think we might have mentioned earlier, we did have some creator marketing spend that we pushed out from the beginning of the year to the back half of the year as we continue to learn kind of really what works with creators and how do we create incentives that give them kind of the motivation to create content that's really useful. And often content that's a lot more evergreen than the kind of ephemeral content you see on a lot of other platforms. That's a pretty different mindset for a lot of the creators that are on competing platforms that are essentially rewarded on a combination of volume and entertainment value versus the ability to inspire action. So a tutorial that might help you teach something and is just as relevant as it searched a year from now, as it was on the day it's posted. So we're still in early experiments with exactly how to do that that's part of the reason that we pushed out some of that spend. But that doesn't reflect a lack of conviction in our investment around initiative. And on shopping, you can think of the shopping API as kind of the next generation of our catalog uploader. So it's very much in line with our desire to get as much up to date and accurate information. And then we apply machine learning to rationalize all of those products and then computer vision to match them up against the scenes. So, we're seeing really good early uptake. It's been a learning process as we've gone from single feed upload to multi-feed upload, now to a proper API. And we continue to see \u2013 we plan to see continued improvement in the quality of inventory, which in turn kind of enables people to go from that inspiration to purchasing experience, which is fundamental to our mission as a company. Well, I just wanted to thank everyone for the thoughtful questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue open. I know it's a busy afternoon for a lot of industries, so enjoy the rest of your day."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. In Q4, our team executed well against our strategic priorities, growing users and engagement, gaining further traction with our lower funnel advertising offerings and delivering on operational efficiency. Our efforts to grow users and deepen engagement continue to yield strong results. Global MAUs hit another all-time record of $498 million, growing 11% accelerating from last quarter and growing sequentially in all of our geographic regions. Q4 revenue of $981 million grew 12%, marking continued double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year. And while growing revenue and engagement, we continue to demonstrate operational efficiency and disciplined expense management, resulting in Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $365 million, or a 37% margin up more than 1400 basis points from last year. Our strong product delivery in Q4 and throughout 2023, with investments focused in lower funnel offerings like mobile deep linking, shopping ads, API for conversions and most recently direct links are delivering sustained ROI improvements for advertisers. This is leading to advertisers growing their budgets with us and has resulted in further acceleration so far in Q1, which is reflected in our guidance that Julia will describe in further detail later in the call. Before I discuss Q4, I'd like to reflect back on the progress we made over the past year. We entered 2023 with a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and a weak digital ads market. However, we delivered strong execution against the strategic priorities we laid out during the second half of 2022, which enabled us to grow through the downturn and get back to double-digit revenue growth in the back half of 2023. During this period, we made significant investments in AI that drove improvements in our overall platform for users and advertisers and we significantly accelerated product velocity across our most important priorities, propelling growth last year and laying the foundation for the future. We focused on helping users find new reasons to come back to Pinterest more often. We also invested in the elements that made Pinterest so-beloved and unique in the first place, like human curation, through saving and organizing content. And as a result, MAUs are growing and users are engaging more deeply with the platform than before. We also made significant advancements on the shopability of the platform. More than half of our users view Pinterest as a place to shop. But historically, it was not easy to click out and go to a merchant site to buy the product you found on Pinterest. Last year, we improved the shopping experience by bringing shopping content front and center into our home feed, search and related services. As a result, we saw engagement with that shoppable content accelerate, as users clicked and save that content at rates significantly higher than in the past. This was clear evidence to us that people come to Pinterest with intent and will take action when we make it easy for them to do so. On the monetization front, the teams innovated across the entire funnel with particular emphasis in the lower funnel as we made it more seamless for users to pivot from inspiration to action through increased shopability. In fact, 2023 was one of our most productive years for ads innovation, as we accelerated product delivery and launched more ad formats, tools and solutions than ever before and continue to drive adoption of our lower funnel solutions for advertisers. These include seamless handoffs like mobile deep linking and direct links, new ad formats like Premier Spotlight, travel catalogs and lead ads and measurement solutions like our API for conversion and clean room integrations. As a smaller player in the overall digital ads ecosystem, adding third-party demand to increase the comprehensiveness of our catalog and the relevance of our ads was a key priority for us. Last year, we announced and launched our first third-party ad partner with Amazon ads, which is scaling well, and we will continue to advance our third-party demand efforts this year and beyond to bring relevant ads that can enhance the user shopping journey. Putting all this together, we were able to achieve year-over-year revenue growth in every quarter in 2023 and get back to double-digit growth in the second half, and we did this while controlling our costs and expanding margins. When we started the year, we laid out a plan to achieve around 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. With revenue growth, operational rigor and cost optimization, we were able to deliver 660 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for 2023. I believe that constraints bread creativity. And in this environment, our teams are able to deliver better experiences for our users and our advertisers with clarity, focus and discipline. Lastly, with a strong executive team, many of whom joined in 2023, we have the right leadership and a strong foundation to execute against our strategic priorities in 2024 and beyond. Now let's take a closer look at the initiatives we launched in Q4 to advance our strategic priorities. During the quarter, we made key updates along the entire inspiration to action journey to grow our users and deepen engagement. These investments are paying off. We had our fastest global MAU growth since Q1 of 2021, and we're seeing our best product market fit in years, as evidenced by the strong growth in our Gen Z demographic and the fact that our most recent user cohorts are significantly more engaged in user cohorts from prior years, consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day. Starting with inspiration. We're enhancing the way users find inspiring content and hone in on exactly what they're looking for by making improvements to our core search capabilities. In Q4, we began testing generative AI-based search guides which help users to refine their understanding from broad queries like kitchen ideas and to more structured avenues of exploration like Rustic Farmhouse Kitchen or Kitchen Organization Hacks, helping users get closer to the point of action or purchase. Additionally, these generative search guides highlight the advancements we're making in AI on the platform in ways that are additive and authentic to the user and that we expect will lead to continued improvements in engagement and retention. After users search for and find the content they're looking for, we're developing new ways to help users curate that inspirational content. At our Investor Day, we introduced Collages, a new interactive pin format composed of cutouts that users can engage with. Users can tap on an image within a scene to cut out components of the image they love and combine them with other cutouts to create interactive collages of their favorite ideas, all in one place. In addition, users can tap on a cutout within a collage to see its associated products, if available, or the source pin that the object was cutout of. This has the potential to create a flywheel of content creation and engagement, which we're excited about. In Q4, we rolled out the collage functionality to nearly all iOS users globally. I'm pleased that this feature is now broadly available for our users as cutouts in collages are a new frontier of creation on Pinterest and allow users to express their creativity and taste in even more visually immersive ways. It also provides us with great first-party signals on what users are interested in, product associations, emerging trends and how we can surface more content and products that are aligned with users' evolving tastes. And we're seeing strong early results and positive feedback from our users. They're finding collage as highly engaging with users three times more likely to save collage pins versus other pins on Pinterest and the majority of collages are created by users who had not previously created a pin. Collage is also skewed heavily towards shoppable content with approximately 75% of collages utilizing a product pin showing the intent our users bring when creating and engaging with content on Pinterest. Moving further down the inspiration to action journey. We're enhancing our board functionality to help users better understand and organize their tastes. Boards are an essential part of the curation flywheel on Pinterest and provide us with important signals on user tastes and preferences, which feeds into our recommendation algorithm and further augments our ability to serve relevant content back to our users. In Q4, we launched our first auto organization feature. This feature leverages AI to simplify the Board creation process by automatically grouping similar pins into suggested boards based on what users have saved in the past. For users who generally don't curate on the platform, this feature resulted in a nearly 30% lift in boards created, highlighting how auto organization can unlock the magic of Pinterest for more users. Finally, we're making it easier for users to shift from inspiration to action and shop products they discover on Pinterest. Over the past few quarters, we've launched shopping modules that help us further capitalize on our audience who come to Pinterest with intent and improve the shopability of our platform. Last quarter, we discussed a few of these efforts for women's fashion and home decor categories, including shop the look and guided shopping modules, which surface shoppable product pins based on past saving and clicking history. In Q4, we launched Shop Similar for mobile in the same categories. While Shop the Look is activated when a user clicks on a lifestyle image such as a celebrity wearing the latest outfit trends or a beautifully curated living room, Shop Similar is activated when a user clicks on a shoppable product pin from a merchant catalog. It then showcases a carousel of similar product pins across a variety of other brands and price points, complementing the feed of related pins below. We're in the early stages of ramping, and in our experiments, shop similar drove double-digit lift in both outbound clicks and checkouts. I spent the last few moments discussing the key product updates we've made across the funnel to help users find the content that inspires them most and take action on it. The billions of intent signals we get from this on-platform, search, click and curation behavior gives us the unique ability to see trends in real time and predict consumer trends for the upcoming year through our annual Pinterest predicts report. We've had an 80% success rate in predicting future trends four years in a row. Some of our 2024 predictions are already making their way into the cultural conversation through publications like Vogue and Glamour U.K., as celebrities and users embrace Pinterest predict trends like Eclectic Grandpa Fashion Looks or Western Gothic Home Design. Blue Beauty, which predicts Gen Z and millennials will embrace Blue Hughes and their makeup protein is taking off on Pinterest right now with searches related to this trend growing 125% since the report was launched. This year, we're incorporating Pinterest's predicts activations for both consumers and advertisers. In December, for the first time, we took our predicts trends to real life. Opening the doors to our first ever predicts pop-up shop in New York, showcasing immersive displays and shoppable items inspired by the trends. Our predictions allow advertisers to plan ahead for new consumer interest, ensuring their products and ads are ready to meet ramping demand. Advertisers can also sponsor co-branded Pinterest Predicts content on our platform to reach targeted audiences. Pinterest Predicts is a great example of our ability to harness user behavior to show compelling trends in content that drive user engagement and provide advertisers with actionable insights they can't find anywhere else. With that, I'd like to turn to our second strategic priority, improving monetization per user and discuss how we're driving success for advertisers. Throughout 2023, we've been focused on driving performance for advertisers by rolling out our lower funnel tools, which include mobile deep linking, the API for conversions and clean rooms and most recently, Direct Link, which launched at the end of Q3 and ramped in Q4. The percentage of revenue from advertisers who adopted at least three of these tools increased from 2% at the beginning of 2023 to 13% at our Investor Day in September to 23% by the end of the year, marking strong progress toward our goal to be a meaningful performance player in the digital ads market. One of the key product enhancements we've rolled out within the lower funnel suite is Direct Link, which creates a more seamless handoff for advertisers. Direct Link take users to an advertiser's product page in just one click significantly reducing friction and improving the ability to take action. Direct Links also require little to no work by the advertiser to adopt and now cover 80% of our lower funnel revenue, up from 60% in October. We expect coverage to continue to increase over the course of Q1. The increased performance and value we were able to drive for advertisers in Q4 was particularly impressive. We more than doubled the amount of clicks we drove to advertisers year-over-year, a substantial increase during a retailer's most important time of year, and we were able to do so while driving high-quality engagement. Retailers are finding significant performance improvement with this format. For example, Urban Outfitters saw a 132% increase in outbound clicks and a 57% decrease in cost per click with a Direct Links enabled campaign. This is strong tangible evidence that we are creating significant real value for advertisers. This value creation comes in the form of increased clicks, lowered CPCs and therefore, higher return on ad spend from our lower funnel products. Each time we have launched products that created meaningful advertiser value, we have seen budgets shift in our direction in the month and quarters that followed as advertisers were able to see and measure sustained performance. Given that we launched these products throughout the year, with Direct Links rolling out most recently during the holiday shopping period, much of the value capture from these new products is still in front of us, given the lag between value creation and value capture. We've seen the same value creation versus value capture adoption curve play out in our business already with larger, more sophisticated retailers taking advantage of products like mobile deep linking and API for conversion and subsequently growing their spend with us. The cumulative effect of the significant improvement in Pinterest's lower funnel and performance ad capability over the last 18 months is that we are increasingly moving from advertisers experimental and social budgets to their performance budgets, which tend to be larger and more resilient. With our improved lower funnel solutions, we know we're driving more clicks in conversions, but performance is only as good as an advertiser's ability to measure it. Moreover, as the industry goes through additional privacy centric changes this year with the expectation that a major browser will be deprecating third-party cookies, there is heightened urgency from agencies and advertisers to drive adoption of future-proofing measurement tools. From a targeting perspective, we believe we are well positioned relative to others due to the first-party signals we capture through user intent expressed directly on our platform. We are a lean forward platform and relevant ads or content to our users. From a conversion visibility and measurement standpoint, we have a broad suite of solutions, which are becoming indispensable for performance advertisers to measure and optimize the value of their spend. This is why we've been heavily focused on adoption of our API for conversions and clean room solutions and providing more third-party measurement solutions for advertisers. On API for conversions, we've laid the groundwork for more adoption in 2024, including reducing the set up time for advertisers through interface updates, while integrating with 24 partners like LiveRamp, Adobe and Salesforce. Additionally, sophisticated advertisers are seeing the value of investing in clean rooms to measure campaign performance on Pinterest. Recently, a large CPG partner enabled measurement through clean rooms and found that their Pinterest's campaign drove a 16-point lift in incremental sales. We also offer a suite of first-party and third-party measurement tools to plug into advertisers measurement system of truth, whether it's brand and conversion lift studies, platform metrics and insights or highly sophisticated media mix modeling and multitouch attribution studies. As we've discussed on previous earnings calls, we're going through a critical shift in the industry and a top priority for our company is growing the adoption of these alternative measurement solutions this year. To do so, we've implemented new adoption goals into our sales force compensation structure to encourage further advertiser penetration. We're growing our performance optimization team who can help with technical selling, and we're continuing to explore deeper partnerships with agencies and integrations with additional partners. In addition to format and measurement innovations, we remain focused on bringing AI-based automation to the forefront of our campaign creation experience. We have many of the components in place for a fully automated ad system including automatic bidding, campaign budget optimization and whole page optimization, which enables us to surface more relevant and performant [ph] ads when a user expresses commercial intent. These tools drive better results in aggregate for our advertisers. For example, automatic bidding covers 85% of our revenue, and whole page optimization is resulting in greater efficiencies across our full funnel. Reducing the time and effort for advertisers on campaign set up, while improving ROI is top of mind moving forward, and we'll see a steady progression of increased automation and easier add platform functionality throughout this year as we continue to build out these products. Next, I want to provide an update on our third-party demand efforts. Consistent with the time line we laid out at our Investor Day, Amazon ads in the US is live on search and related surfaces. And as of this quarter, we are testing it on the home feed. In addition, we always said we would have multiple partners and the third-party partners would be an important component of our overall international expansion. Today, I'm pleased to announce our next third-party ad integration with Google. This partnership will focus on monetizing several of our currently unmonetized international markets by enabling ads to be served on Pinterest via Google's Ad Manager. We went live a couple of weeks ago, and this is starting to ramp. Third-party ad demand is scaling as we anticipated. And while it was not a significant revenue contributor in Q4, we are now seeing it contribute more meaningfully to our growth this quarter, and we expect that to continue going forward. Our third strategic priority is continued focus on operational rigor and discipline. As I mentioned before, I'm proud of our team's execution here as our operating expenses declined year-over-year, and we grew our EBITDA margins by over 1,400 basis points. Julie will provide more details on our future profitability outlook later in the call. Lastly, I want to spend a few moments discussing a topic that's most importance to this company and to me personally. Since joining Pinterest, I've talked extensively about Pinterest as a positive place online and how maintaining this positivity is a pivotal component of our ethos as a company. It's also a meaningful differentiator for our platform and a core part of our strategy for growing users and advertisers. Users, especially Gen Z, often crave respite from social media and see Pinterest as a positive alternative. Advertisers for their part, want to be present in a positive, brand-safe environment that can also deliver performance. I recently had the opportunity to speak alongside key thought leaders at the inaugural Youth Online Safety Summit hosted by Commonsense Media, a leading advocacy organization working to ensure that the Internet is healthy, safe and empowering for young people. It was an honor to be able to speak alongside the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, about how Pinterest is working to build an alternative social media business model, one that is focused on positivity. We're not perfect, and we don't have all the answers. Like the rest of the industry, we have a long way to go, but it is my intention to make Pinterest a safe place for everyone, especially on people. We're one of the few places online that is about focusing on your own life versus just observing the lives of others, about making plans for what you intend to do. We've taken a radically different stance than our competitors, and we're seeing it pay off in the emotional well-being of our users and in our business outcomes. These principles are at the heart of our technology, our AI and our policies, and we are being accountable and transparent about how we're doing and sharing our learnings across the industry. Our company mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love and our work to make Pinterest a positive corner of the internet is an integral part of how we embody our mission every day. Now I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more about our financial performance.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our full year and fourth quarter 2023 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary first quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, I want to echo Bill's sentiments about the progress we made in 2023 and how far we've come in a short period of time. Last year, we generated $3.1 billion in revenue, growing 9% with revenue reaccelerating to double-digit growth in the back half of the year. We've been strategic with our investments that enabled us to invest in high ROI projects such as AI for content recommendation and ads and accelerating the pace of innovation across the board. We did this while driving efficiencies with our infrastructure spend and keeping our total non-GAAP expenses in 2023, roughly flat compared to 2022. This allowed us to deliver $683 million of adjusted EBITDA or a 22% adjusted EBITDA margin, representing 660 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion well above our initial goal at the start of 2023 of 200 basis points. Finally, at our recent Investor Day in September, we shared our long-term outlook with a revenue CAGR in the mid to high teens and EBITDA margins expanding to the low 30s percent range in the next 3 to 5 years. Our recent results and our focus on executing against our strategic priorities sets us up well to achieve these targets over this time frame. Now I'll discuss our fourth quarter results. We ended the year with 498 million global monthly active users, representing 11% growth. This is the strongest growth we've seen since Q1 2021, with MAU growth accelerating versus last quarter and growing sequentially in all of our geographic regions. We believe that our continued investments to help users find their next use case and quickly pivot from inspiration to action and shopping are paying off as we've been able to drive deeper engagement with our users. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 97 million MAUs, growing 2%, up from 1% growth last quarter and adding 1 million MAUs sequentially for the second quarter in a row. In Europe, we had 135 million MAUs, growing 8%, an acceleration from last quarter. In our rest of world markets, we had 266 million MAUs growing 15%, continuing the trend of acceleration throughout 2023. In Q4, our global revenue was $981 million, up 12% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Our fastest-growing objective was our lowest funnel conversion objective buoyed by strength in the retail vertical, including our shopping ad format. This is a testament to the innovative work we are doing to drive more clicks and conversions for performance advertisers and demonstrates that our business is evolving as we are deploying more lower funnel products and getting access to more performance budgets. Our awareness objective was also relatively resilient, with strength from new formats like Premier Spotlight, as this was the first holiday season with this offering. However, this growth was partially offset by headwinds from the food and beverage category, as these advertisers pulled back spending towards the end of the quarter due to challenges from macro headwinds. We estimate that the underperformance in the food and beverage category created roughly 1 percentage point of headwind to total revenue growth in Q4. Turning to our geographical breakouts. In the US and Canada, we generated $778 million in revenue, growing 8%. Strength came from retailers and from emerging categories, including financial services. In Europe, revenue was $162 million, growing 32% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. Strength in Europe came from retail and CPG categories. Revenue from Rest of World was $41 million, growing 27% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. In Q4, ad impressions, which is composed of ad load and total impressions, including both organic and paid impressions, accelerated to 33% growth driven both by increases in total impressions and increases in ad load. This marks the sixth quarter in a row where we've been able to grow both total impressions and ad load demonstrating that ads can grow in tandem with engagement, especially when those ads are relevant to users. During the holiday season, our continued investments in whole page optimization to dynamically flex up ad load when users express commercial intent enabled us to open up more ad supply, especially when users were leaned in to shop during the holiday season. Offsetting the growth in ad impressions was a 16% decline in ad pricing due to our continued work to drive greater platform efficiency for lower funnel advertisers, which lowered prices and improved return on ad spend for those advertisers. Now, I'd like to turn to expenses. While our Q4 revenue grew double digits, our operating expenses declined double digits as we continue to control our expenses diligently and balance investments for future growth. Cost of revenue in Q4 was $174 million, down 2% due to continued cost optimization work on the infrastructure side, even while MAUs reached an all-time high and engagement continued to grow. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $446 million, down 12%. Our heightened focus on driving operational efficiencies throughout the business showed through again this quarter. All of our operating expense line items declined year-over-year, led by sales and marketing, which declined 18% as we lapped our large brand marketing campaign from Q4 2022. These efforts led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA coming in at $365 million, an all-time high. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%, up 1,400 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.5 billion. Now, I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the first quarter. We expect Q1 2024 revenue to be in the range of $690 million to $705 million, representing 15% to 17% growth and a meaningful acceleration from our Q4 '23 revenue growth. It's also worth noting that our guide implies up to a 500 basis point acceleration on top of a stable comp from last year, since revenue growth from Q4 '22 to Q1 '23 was relatively consistent. I'd like to provide some additional color and context behind this guide for Q1. First, we're in the midst of an adoption curve of our lower funnel advertising products. In 2023, many of our largest and most sophisticated advertisers took advantage of lower funnel ad products like mobile deep linking, shopping ads or API for conversions. These advertisers have seen sustained performance gains with these formats and are growing their budgets with us, the benefits of which we've seen throughout the course of the year and accelerating into Q1, which is off to a strong start, as Bill mentioned. We see multiple of our large sophisticated retail advertisers allocating more of their performance budgets to us after seeing a longer track record of return on ad spend. As a result, we are beginning to garner more meaningful shares of their overall ad budgets, and we see more of this adoption curve yet to play out with many of our retailers. Second, we launched direct links in late Q3 and early Q4 to help drive more clicks and conversions for all of the other advertisers who may not have as much mobile app penetration and were not good candidates for mobile deep linking. We created value for those advertisers by doubling the clicks we drove for advertisers in Q4. However, we believe the value capture from direct links will come over the course of 2024 and beyond as those advertisers use their own analytics to measure attribution from Pinterest and incrementally increase their budgets with us as a result. Third, our Q1 revenue guidance includes an emerging contribution from third-party ad demand. We are pleased with how this is tracking and we'll continue to learn, iterate, optimize and ramp over the course of this year and beyond. Finally, our guidance takes into account a modest impact from foreign exchange rates. Turning to our Q1 expense guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $450 million to $465 million, growing 9% to 13%. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to continue our infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore, we anticipate non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q4. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we are investing in head count for AI talent across our business and in sales and marketing, where we will be investing in B2B marketing to advertisers. As we said during Investor Day, we plan to have a steady ramp to the low 30s percent adjusted EBITDA margin range in the next three to five years. Consistent with that, we are anticipating margin expansion again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023 as we balance investing in growth and falling profitability through to the bottom line. As a reminder, the pacing of that margin expansion in 2024 is likely to be more front-loaded in the first quarter due to the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margin we saw as we progress through the quarters of 2023. In summary, 2023 was an instrumental year as we built the foundation for our future growth and return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year. Our Q1 guidance implies further acceleration, which shows that we are making good progress towards our long-term goals. As we look to this year, we plan to build on that momentum and continue executing against our key strategic priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Julia. I'm proud of all we were able to achieve in the last year, and I'm even more excited for the year ahead. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nQ - Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question, and thanks for all the details in the prepared remarks. I want to go back to some of the comments more broadly on the advertising environment because I think generally investors and analysts have heard a variety of messages about the health of brand advertising and direct response advertising and certain geographic exposure over the last sort of two weeks. Can you just go into a little bit more detail on what you saw in Q4 and how you sets you up for cumulative advertising budget conversations into Q1 and through the remainder of 2024? Thanks so much.\nWilliam Ready: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. So we also see the broader ad market as stable to improving. For us, Retail was the fastest growing segment. And we're seeing across the entire ad industry, performance matters more than ever, and we're winning on that front. We're driving more performance to advertisers than ever before. As I mentioned in my remarks, large advertisers are opening up their performance budgets for us. Doubling our clicks sent to advertisers year-on-year, a strong indicator of not only the value that we have already created, but of how much more value capture is still left in front of us on that. So we also see that improvement, but performance is the name of the game, and we've made a major progression on performance over the last 18 months. And so those are the comments I'd make offer because Julia wants to add any more on some of the other things that we saw in the market there.\nJulia Donnelly: I'd say the only other thing we called this out in the script, Eric, is we did see not a significant impact from the Middle East, if we talked about on the prior earnings call. So that was a very temporary impact to us. It was fully recovered by the time we got on the last call. So that to us was not a major headwind, given the fact that we are making this transition to more performance budgets, as Bill alluded to. We did see a little bit of tail off in December from the food and beverage category, which is consistent with the public commentary that we've seen elsewhere, we're seeing that headwind continue into Q1. But in general, Q1 is off to a really, really good start, and we feel very confident in the acceleration that we're seeing and guiding to in Q1, which is a result of a lot of the lower funnel investments that Bill was alluding to earlier.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Thanks, guys. Question on the Google partnership. So Bill, everybody can see that the ARPU gap between Europe and U.S. for you guys is about twice as big as Meta. So can you talk about, I guess, the difference between the Google partnership and what you have going with Amazon right now? And is the mix of categories outside of retail that Google brings to the table going to - could that be more meaningful in terms of your ARPU improvement? And are you allowed to use any of those non-retail categories in the U.S. from Google or not? Thanks a lot.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Ross. Great question. And as we've talked about on the international front, we see Pinterest significantly undermonetized across the board. But the most undermonetized internationally. We have approximately 80% of our users outside the US, but only 20% of our revenue. So as we shared at our Investor Day, we think that's a meaningful opportunity for us to increase that ARPU internationally. At Investor Day, we talked about how we would leverage both 3P, as well as resellers and other partnerships to help us advance there. So, we're quite excited about the partnership with Google as particularly for those unmonetized markets, we think it can help us to accelerate the ARPU journey for those markets and bring more relevant content and actionable content to users in those markets. As we've demonstrated that our users have a commercial intent on our platform, the ads can be great content. You've seen that in our increase of impressions, ad impressions, while also increasing engagement, demonstrating that the ads can be great content when they use it in a commercial context, we think it will also be additive from that perspective as well. Your question on Amazon, we feel really good about the way the Amazon partnership is scaling also. And there are international markets that can be in play there as well. So as we've talked about the 3P strategy overall, we think about 3P as a way to fill in gaps in our auction and bring more relevant content to our users. And so we're quite pleased with the way the Amazon partnership is progressing. And the Google partnership with the focus on our unmonetized or undermonetized international markets, we think will be quite additive as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Rich Greenfield with Lightshed Partners. Your line is now open.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm seeing more and more video ad units when I'm on Pinterest, just scrolling through the feed. I guess the question, Bill, is when you talk about AI and machine learning, I guess, how should we think about how your algorithms and systems are figuring out whether to deliver a static image ad or a video ad for each available ad opportunity. And then just any comments on sort of the conversion of ROEs [ph] that you're seeing for video ads versus the static ads, any trends? Or any color you can give us would be really helpful? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Sure, thanks. Thanks, Rich. So video remains more than 30% of our revenue. It's been a bright spot for us on the platform that we are driving really great monetization on video. And we've talked about how much AI is a core competency for us and how much that has driven increases in relevancy on the organic side, as well as improvements on the ad side as well. Our model being 100 times larger than they were a year ago, as we talked about last quarter. And so one of the things we're seeing from that AI-driven improvement in relevancy is a really good ability to discern what's relevant for which user at the right moment in time, and that includes both video and still images. And so we're seeing that work quite well in our fee, the balance between video and still imagery and I think you see it reflected quite well in our progress with users that we just put up our best user growth quarter since Q1 of 2021. We're deepening engagement per user. Gen Z is now our largest fastest-growing demographic. They're very video-centric as well. We are winning with Gen Z. So I think those are all the things I'd point to that say we're really getting the right balance of still imagery versus video with really good multi mobile capabilities and our AI-driven relevancy on those things.\nRich Greenfield: And when I look at Gen Z, is it fair to say that they're seeing an even higher percentage of video then?\nWilliam Ready: Gen Z, the demographic tends to be more video-centric and as we've talked about, we are performing quite well with Gen Z. But interestingly, it's not just video. When we see things like I talked about collages in my comments, we are creating entirely new content types on Pinterest like collages where users can curate, and they've done that historically on board, but collage as now make that an even deeper level of granularity where people can put together outfits and room designs at much greater granularity driven by AI recommendations on those things. And so we're seeing Gen Z really engage deeply with that as well. And as I mentioned in my remarks, not only is that driving engagement it's driving shopping behaviors of 75% plus of those collages that are created contain shoppable products. And so quite pleased with how our team leveraging AI is finding great ways to bring new content types to the right users at the right moment in time, particularly around commercial intent.\nRichard Greenfield: Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking questions. I have two. You talked about doubling down on momentum in '24. I was just curious if you can talk about any key priorities for the year that really stand out? And is there any change to how you're thinking about profitability in '24? And then just quickly on China advertiser spending. Any color on exposure levels and perhaps how it trended in 4Q? Thank you.\nJulia Donnelly: Sure. Thanks for the question, Doug. I'll take that one. So overall, we're feeling really good about the progress that we're making on our 3 to 5 year outlook, and we talked about at Investor Day, having a steady ramp to that low 30-ish percent EBITDA margin range in the next three to five years. As I said in my prepared remarks, we do intend to expand margin again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis points that we delivered in 2023. So we are planning to drive more margin expansion and see operating leverage in the business in 2024. On an absolute dollar basis in terms of where the areas where we're increasing our levels of investment, we plan to focus in our R&D area, tying to head count additions primarily in AI, both for - to benefit our users and our advertisers. On the sales and marketing line, we also anticipate adding to our sales organization with a focus on enhanced technical selling capabilities and also expansion of some frontline sellers in our international markets as well. To your question about China-based e-commerce retailers, we are seeing some benefit from that category of advertiser in Q4. That is a nice contributor for us. But it is by no means the only contributor. We are seeing strong growth in the retail category that is broad-based, including several other major retailers aside from those categories in China. And so we think we're a great fit for those retailers. And I don't think we're as exposed there as some of our other peers may be.\nDoug Anmuth: Got it. Thank you, Julia.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Q1 outlook. And is there a way to peel back the different drivers of this acceleration between kind of the core product improvements than the Amazon, maybe the Google contribution coming in? And then, I guess, other things like the extra day in the quarter, like if you were to peel apart those, maybe you can't quantify, but directionally, which of those has the biggest impact on driving the acceleration, which is a second, which is third? How would you triage those? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks for the question, Mark. As we talked about at our Investor Day, we've got multiple ways to win here. We've talked about driving better lower funnel performance. We are driving forward on that, performing quite well on that front. We talked about international in 3P. We see those contributing quite nicely as well. And so it is very much a multipronged approach, and we see really solid performance across each of those very much in line with the plans we laid out at our Investor Day. So, in the same way that we talked about multiple ways to win at Investor Day. We see progress on every single one of those fronts, and we see it as a balanced approach, and we continue to see that way as we look into Q1 and next year.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wanted to ask maybe bigger picture. You talked about larger retail advertising, just to allocate advertisers allocating more performance budgets to the Pinterest as you evolve from experimental. Just talk to us about the process here to get to more performance ad budgets to be that line item and how this fits in your commentary on working with agencies and incentives? And then a quick follow-up on just Mark's call, just Mark's question, just there, Julia. Any insights on just Easter adding extra -- with Easter being earlier this year and/or the extra day in the quarter? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks for the question, Ron. So as we've talked about before, we've been on a major transformation from a primarily brand ad-driven platform a couple of years ago to a performance-driven platform today. And we shared at Investor Day two thirds of our revenue now coming from the lower funnel. So we are well down that path on that transformation. At the same time, we are continuing to launch major improvements to our performance ad product and we're on an adoption curve there. So for example, we launched Mobile deep links to GA sort of middle of the year last year. And then we are still seeing more and more retailers not only adopt that, but then shift budget to us as a result of that. With direct links, we launched that as we were right into the holiday shopping season when most of the retailers are sort of hunkered down and that really making major shifts. So we're able to deliver that without the advertiser doing work, and we doubled the number of clicks we sent to advertisers year-on-year. And as we're going into Q1, we're seeing that now start to show up in budget allocations moving to us. But we think we have a lot more of that to go. And to give you a little bit more sense of this, if you looked at our lower funnel performance tools, things like conversion API, mobile deep links, direct links, clean rooms. At the start of last year, we had roughly 2% of our revenue coming from those who have at least three of those lower funnel tools. By Investor Day, that was 13% of our revenue coming from those that had at least three of those lower funnel tools. By the end of the year, it was 23% of our revenue coming from those who had at least three of those lower funnel tools. So that gives you a sense for how we're making strong progress, but also to my comments around how there is a lot more of the value capture still in front of us from products that we have already launched that we know are performing well. And of course, we are continuing to innovate there as well. So a lot more to come on that.\nJulia Donnelly: And then maybe I'll just add to that. As Bill was talking about, we're seeing nice growth from retail, in particular, and that's really kind of already capturing some of the value from some of the investments that we made over the course of 2023. One additional stat I'll share, this is on an updated version of a stat that we had last year, which is that those who have adopted our API for conversions are actually seeing retailers who adopt our API for conversions are actually seeing year-over-year growth in the 30% range compared to non-adopters of our API for conversions who are declining mid-single digits. So another further data point to support the growth that we're seeing and the budgets that are coming our way as we're delivering sustained ROAS [ph] performance. To your question on Q1 and kind of puts and takes in Q1. Just a reminder again that our acceleration that we're guiding to in Q1 is off the back of a stable comp from last year. There are kind of small puts and takes and a small tailwind from timing of Easter or addition of leap day this year, but those are by no means the major driver. The major drivers are the strength that we're seeing in the retail category tied to large advertisers, the emerging contribution from 3P and some of the other factors that we've discussed today on the call. So overall, this is us doing what we said we would do at Investor Day and delivering on some acceleration in capturing value from all of the investments that we've made over the last year, and we feel really good about the growth that we're seeing, the sustainability of that growth and the progress that we're making against those goals.\nRon Josey: Thank you, Julia. Thank you, Bill.\nJulia Donnelly: Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be from the line of Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So maybe could we dig in a little bit more on your accelerating monthly active user growth this quarter. You talked about success with Gen Z, any additional quantification you could put around that would be great. And then maybe any color around other demographics, like, for example, men and then we can see the growth by region, obviously, but any particular countries that you would call out for where you're seeing particular strength in our growth? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Certainly, on Gen Z, we've talked about it's more than 40% of our user base now. And there's multiple factors driving the improvement in users and engagement at its core. We're helping users find more of what they're interested in, on Pinterest, helping them take action on it and delivering a positive environment for them that they see as an oasis away from the toxicity of much of the rest of social media. This gets cited to us directly particularly by Gen Z users. And so we are carving out a unique space for ourselves that is quite different from the rest of social media that is more about users investing in themselves. Things are additive to their lives versus sort of viewing the lives of others or that where they feel like they have to perform for others. And so it is a really unique and ownable space, and we're seeing that really cut through with users and again, with advertisers as well to see it as a brand-safe environment. On geographies, as you mentioned, you can see the geographic growth there. The couple of things I'd mention are just on U-Can. We saw, again, another nice, really nice growth quarter there in our mature markets. I've been saying this for the last six quarters. Our mature market is much more about driving depth of engagement, and we feel really good about the depth of engagement that we're driving, particularly actionability on to the platform. You see that reflected in the increase in clicks, where users are taking action on our platform, a big question 18 months ago. Users not only come here with intent, but they are taking action. And internationally, the big question there has always been the monetization. And we have nice momentum there, but we have a lot more that we can do, and we're quite excited about our first-party selling efforts, the things we can do with reseller partners and agencies. We're making progress on those fronts and then bring 3P into the mix there with Google, particularly for those unmonetized and undermonetized markets. We think there's a lot we can do that not only drives the monetization per user, but again, drive that actionability for the user that we think can help further enhance the user engagement for users in those international markets.\nJulia Donnelly: Only other thing I'd add, Dan, to your question on sort of the acceleration that we've seen in MAU growth, which were proud of. As Bill mentioned, it is also carrying through in terms of depth of engagement. And so were continuing to see our mobile app MAU growth accelerate even faster than our total MAU growth. And as we look at total impressions, which is one of the drivers of ad impressions, but total impressions that continues to grow even faster than our MAU growth as well. So continue to see nice trends there consistent with some of the longer-term trends we shared at Investor Day.\nDan Salmon: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Kenneth Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thank you, very much. Just two, if I may, real quickly. First, on revenue mix and thinking about 4Q versus 1Q, you talked about the headwinds from the food and beverage category in 4Q continuing into 1Q, but yet you did guide to an acceleration. Should we think about that as -- is there a mix component to that, meaning heavier brand adds or heavy brand in 4Q versus 1Q? Or is that all just all DR acceleration and the 3P kicking in? And then second, please, I just hope maybe if you could walk us through a little bit. And you talked about this, Bill, about the value capture versus value creation. Looking at those impressions plus 33 in the fourth quarter, which is really impressive. As you think about throughout '24, not a 1Q question, but throughout '24, do you see that your Pinterest's ability to close that gap over time in terms of see advertising revenue relative to those impression growth? And what are the key kind of steps you're going to take to get that done? Thank you.\nJulia Donnelly: Okay. Maybe I'll take the first part of your question, Ken. So it is not mix. It is more acceleration and ongoing acceleration from retail and an emerging contribution from 3P. So we do see continuing headwind from food and beverage, but it is more that it's being even more offset by other positive growth factors that are driving our Q1 acceleration.\nWilliam Ready: And on your question on the value capture versus value create. There's always a lag between these things. Advertisers need to see the performance sustain and you see it flow through into their models and their measurement. And so the thing we feel really great about is that, that value - the value create is the hardest part and has to happen first, and we're seeing that as we drive more users with more intent to those advertisers. So that's really fantastic raw material for us. And we've only really just started the value capture on that. And what comes ahead in that is some of that is just advertisers see that bake into their own models of performance. Some of that is about getting advertisers on to privacy safe measurement. Julia talked about, and we started talking about this Q1 - late Q1, I believe, of last year around adopters of API for conversions as a cohort growing at 30%, approximately 30%, those that had not adopted being mid single-digit decliners. That trend continues as we drive that adoption. So as I mentioned in my comments, the performance doesn't matter to the advertisers if they can't see it through their measurement. So driving that adoption curve on measurement matters quite a lot as well. But we're seeing - again, we're seeing that budget shift toward us continue. We saw that through the year this past year, doubling our growth rate from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. We see further acceleration as we look into Q1 as reflected in our guide. And we think there's a lot more of that to go as we continue to drive through that adoption curve. I hope that helps.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks, and good afternoon. A couple, I guess, for me as well. Bill, maybe a follow-up on the MAUs. Are you saying that there is a faster conversion of maybe those occasional users maybe quarterly or semiannual users to monthly users? Or are you seeing just users who are new to the platform overall. And then secondly, in highlighting the improvements you've made in relevancy and recommendations of ads and cons in the platform. I know there's a lot of work with machine learning behind all of that and using signals from users. So I guess I'm just curious, how far along do you think you are in really optimizing that level of personalization and hitting those key advertiser objectives like conversion rates? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yes. Thanks for the question, Colin. So on your first question around MAU, we are seeing progress both in bringing new users to the platform. We talked about Gen Z, where we are winning with Gen Z and they are finding Pinterest quite compelling and unique and different from the rest of social media. So we are bringing new users on the platform like our Gen Z examples. But it's also the case that we are deeply engaged with existing users, giving them more reasons to come back to Pinterest more frequently. And I'd say there's two large drivers in that. One is as we make better and better recommendations. That gives them more reasons to come back and giving them more suggested use cases, helping them to broaden out what they think they can do on Pinterest showing them adjacent use cases. So that's working quite well. And then it's the actionability. As I've said many times before, Pinterest had previously solved digital window shopping, but all the stores were closed, actionability was hard. How good was the digital window shopping, so good that people would keep coming back even though all the stores were closed. But as we open those stores, people have good reason to come back more and more frequently. So the MAU acceleration and the growth there is broad-based and it is both bringing new users on the platform, winning with Gen Z, as well as driving depth of engagement with new adjacent use cases and better actionability that caused users to come back more frequently. On your second question, on relevancy. This is where we just get really amazing first-party signal that feeds AI. AI is only as good as a signal upon which is acting. And we get really amazing signal on what users are interested in. I've talked about Pinterest predicts and our ability to predict there and see trends that are coming because users plan for the future on Pinterest. We see users in their shopping journeys long before that intent has been expressed on other platforms. And so that's really rich signal. As we're leveraging next-gen AI with models that are 100 times larger than they were before, we're seeing really fantastic ability to take that completely unique signal to Pinterest and convert that into great relevant recommendations for users. I shared on our last call that we saw approximately 10 percentage point improvement in relevancy when we move to our large language models. And that flywheel between the user coming and curating, giving a signal of what they're interested in and then us being able to give better and better recommendations to users. We see that flywheel accelerating, particularly as we bring in more actionability. So again, AI is a core competency for us. And importantly, we have a completely unique signal that you wouldn't find elsewhere around the user curation particularly around their commercial intent. And when we see that really just continuing to drive that flywheel as we go forward. Hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions today. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Bill for some final closing remarks.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going. As always, we hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our full year and fourth quarter 2023 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary first quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, I want to echo Bill's sentiments about the progress we made in 2023 and how far we've come in a short period of time. Last year, we generated $3.1 billion in revenue, growing 9% with revenue reaccelerating to double-digit growth in the back half of the year. We've been strategic with our investments that enabled us to invest in high ROI projects such as AI for content recommendation and ads and accelerating the pace of innovation across the board. We did this while driving efficiencies with our infrastructure spend and keeping our total non-GAAP expenses in 2023, roughly flat compared to 2022. This allowed us to deliver $683 million of adjusted EBITDA or a 22% adjusted EBITDA margin, representing 660 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion well above our initial goal at the start of 2023 of 200 basis points. Finally, at our recent Investor Day in September, we shared our long-term outlook with a revenue CAGR in the mid to high teens and EBITDA margins expanding to the low 30s percent range in the next 3 to 5 years. Our recent results and our focus on executing against our strategic priorities sets us up well to achieve these targets over this time frame. Now I'll discuss our fourth quarter results. We ended the year with 498 million global monthly active users, representing 11% growth. This is the strongest growth we've seen since Q1 2021, with MAU growth accelerating versus last quarter and growing sequentially in all of our geographic regions. We believe that our continued investments to help users find their next use case and quickly pivot from inspiration to action and shopping are paying off as we've been able to drive deeper engagement with our users. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 97 million MAUs, growing 2%, up from 1% growth last quarter and adding 1 million MAUs sequentially for the second quarter in a row. In Europe, we had 135 million MAUs, growing 8%, an acceleration from last quarter. In our rest of world markets, we had 266 million MAUs growing 15%, continuing the trend of acceleration throughout 2023. In Q4, our global revenue was $981 million, up 12% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Our fastest-growing objective was our lowest funnel conversion objective buoyed by strength in the retail vertical, including our shopping ad format. This is a testament to the innovative work we are doing to drive more clicks and conversions for performance advertisers and demonstrates that our business is evolving as we are deploying more lower funnel products and getting access to more performance budgets. Our awareness objective was also relatively resilient, with strength from new formats like Premier Spotlight, as this was the first holiday season with this offering. However, this growth was partially offset by headwinds from the food and beverage category, as these advertisers pulled back spending towards the end of the quarter due to challenges from macro headwinds. We estimate that the underperformance in the food and beverage category created roughly 1 percentage point of headwind to total revenue growth in Q4. Turning to our geographical breakouts. In the US and Canada, we generated $778 million in revenue, growing 8%. Strength came from retailers and from emerging categories, including financial services. In Europe, revenue was $162 million, growing 32% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. Strength in Europe came from retail and CPG categories. Revenue from Rest of World was $41 million, growing 27% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. In Q4, ad impressions, which is composed of ad load and total impressions, including both organic and paid impressions, accelerated to 33% growth driven both by increases in total impressions and increases in ad load. This marks the sixth quarter in a row where we've been able to grow both total impressions and ad load demonstrating that ads can grow in tandem with engagement, especially when those ads are relevant to users. During the holiday season, our continued investments in whole page optimization to dynamically flex up ad load when users express commercial intent enabled us to open up more ad supply, especially when users were leaned in to shop during the holiday season. Offsetting the growth in ad impressions was a 16% decline in ad pricing due to our continued work to drive greater platform efficiency for lower funnel advertisers, which lowered prices and improved return on ad spend for those advertisers. Now, I'd like to turn to expenses. While our Q4 revenue grew double digits, our operating expenses declined double digits as we continue to control our expenses diligently and balance investments for future growth. Cost of revenue in Q4 was $174 million, down 2% due to continued cost optimization work on the infrastructure side, even while MAUs reached an all-time high and engagement continued to grow. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $446 million, down 12%. Our heightened focus on driving operational efficiencies throughout the business showed through again this quarter. All of our operating expense line items declined year-over-year, led by sales and marketing, which declined 18% as we lapped our large brand marketing campaign from Q4 2022. These efforts led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA coming in at $365 million, an all-time high. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%, up 1,400 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.5 billion. Now, I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the first quarter. We expect Q1 2024 revenue to be in the range of $690 million to $705 million, representing 15% to 17% growth and a meaningful acceleration from our Q4 '23 revenue growth. It's also worth noting that our guide implies up to a 500 basis point acceleration on top of a stable comp from last year, since revenue growth from Q4 '22 to Q1 '23 was relatively consistent. I'd like to provide some additional color and context behind this guide for Q1. First, we're in the midst of an adoption curve of our lower funnel advertising products. In 2023, many of our largest and most sophisticated advertisers took advantage of lower funnel ad products like mobile deep linking, shopping ads or API for conversions. These advertisers have seen sustained performance gains with these formats and are growing their budgets with us, the benefits of which we've seen throughout the course of the year and accelerating into Q1, which is off to a strong start, as Bill mentioned. We see multiple of our large sophisticated retail advertisers allocating more of their performance budgets to us after seeing a longer track record of return on ad spend. As a result, we are beginning to garner more meaningful shares of their overall ad budgets, and we see more of this adoption curve yet to play out with many of our retailers. Second, we launched direct links in late Q3 and early Q4 to help drive more clicks and conversions for all of the other advertisers who may not have as much mobile app penetration and were not good candidates for mobile deep linking. We created value for those advertisers by doubling the clicks we drove for advertisers in Q4. However, we believe the value capture from direct links will come over the course of 2024 and beyond as those advertisers use their own analytics to measure attribution from Pinterest and incrementally increase their budgets with us as a result. Third, our Q1 revenue guidance includes an emerging contribution from third-party ad demand. We are pleased with how this is tracking and we'll continue to learn, iterate, optimize and ramp over the course of this year and beyond. Finally, our guidance takes into account a modest impact from foreign exchange rates. Turning to our Q1 expense guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $450 million to $465 million, growing 9% to 13%. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to continue our infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore, we anticipate non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q4. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we are investing in head count for AI talent across our business and in sales and marketing, where we will be investing in B2B marketing to advertisers. As we said during Investor Day, we plan to have a steady ramp to the low 30s percent adjusted EBITDA margin range in the next three to five years. Consistent with that, we are anticipating margin expansion again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023 as we balance investing in growth and falling profitability through to the bottom line. As a reminder, the pacing of that margin expansion in 2024 is likely to be more front-loaded in the first quarter due to the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margin we saw as we progress through the quarters of 2023. In summary, 2023 was an instrumental year as we built the foundation for our future growth and return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year. Our Q1 guidance implies further acceleration, which shows that we are making good progress towards our long-term goals. As we look to this year, we plan to build on that momentum and continue executing against our key strategic priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill. I'd say the only other thing we called this out in the script, Eric, is we did see not a significant impact from the Middle East, if we talked about on the prior earnings call. So that was a very temporary impact to us. It was fully recovered by the time we got on the last call. So that to us was not a major headwind, given the fact that we are making this transition to more performance budgets, as Bill alluded to. We did see a little bit of tail off in December from the food and beverage category, which is consistent with the public commentary that we've seen elsewhere, we're seeing that headwind continue into Q1. But in general, Q1 is off to a really, really good start, and we feel very confident in the acceleration that we're seeing and guiding to in Q1, which is a result of a lot of the lower funnel investments that Bill was alluding to earlier. Sure. Thanks for the question, Doug. I'll take that one. So overall, we're feeling really good about the progress that we're making on our 3 to 5 year outlook, and we talked about at Investor Day, having a steady ramp to that low 30-ish percent EBITDA margin range in the next three to five years. As I said in my prepared remarks, we do intend to expand margin again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis points that we delivered in 2023. So we are planning to drive more margin expansion and see operating leverage in the business in 2024. On an absolute dollar basis in terms of where the areas where we're increasing our levels of investment, we plan to focus in our R&D area, tying to head count additions primarily in AI, both for - to benefit our users and our advertisers. On the sales and marketing line, we also anticipate adding to our sales organization with a focus on enhanced technical selling capabilities and also expansion of some frontline sellers in our international markets as well. To your question about China-based e-commerce retailers, we are seeing some benefit from that category of advertiser in Q4. That is a nice contributor for us. But it is by no means the only contributor. We are seeing strong growth in the retail category that is broad-based, including several other major retailers aside from those categories in China. And so we think we're a great fit for those retailers. And I don't think we're as exposed there as some of our other peers may be. And then maybe I'll just add to that. As Bill was talking about, we're seeing nice growth from retail, in particular, and that's really kind of already capturing some of the value from some of the investments that we made over the course of 2023. One additional stat I'll share, this is on an updated version of a stat that we had last year, which is that those who have adopted our API for conversions are actually seeing retailers who adopt our API for conversions are actually seeing year-over-year growth in the 30% range compared to non-adopters of our API for conversions who are declining mid-single digits. So another further data point to support the growth that we're seeing and the budgets that are coming our way as we're delivering sustained ROAS [ph] performance. To your question on Q1 and kind of puts and takes in Q1. Just a reminder again that our acceleration that we're guiding to in Q1 is off the back of a stable comp from last year. There are kind of small puts and takes and a small tailwind from timing of Easter or addition of leap day this year, but those are by no means the major driver. The major drivers are the strength that we're seeing in the retail category tied to large advertisers, the emerging contribution from 3P and some of the other factors that we've discussed today on the call. So overall, this is us doing what we said we would do at Investor Day and delivering on some acceleration in capturing value from all of the investments that we've made over the last year, and we feel really good about the growth that we're seeing, the sustainability of that growth and the progress that we're making against those goals. Thank you. Only other thing I'd add, Dan, to your question on sort of the acceleration that we've seen in MAU growth, which were proud of. As Bill mentioned, it is also carrying through in terms of depth of engagement. And so were continuing to see our mobile app MAU growth accelerate even faster than our total MAU growth. And as we look at total impressions, which is one of the drivers of ad impressions, but total impressions that continues to grow even faster than our MAU growth as well. So continue to see nice trends there consistent with some of the longer-term trends we shared at Investor Day. Okay. Maybe I'll take the first part of your question, Ken. So it is not mix. It is more acceleration and ongoing acceleration from retail and an emerging contribution from 3P. So we do see continuing headwind from food and beverage, but it is more that it's being even more offset by other positive growth factors that are driving our Q1 acceleration."

            "name": "William Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. In Q4, our team executed well against our strategic priorities, growing users and engagement, gaining further traction with our lower funnel advertising offerings and delivering on operational efficiency. Our efforts to grow users and deepen engagement continue to yield strong results. Global MAUs hit another all-time record of $498 million, growing 11% accelerating from last quarter and growing sequentially in all of our geographic regions. Q4 revenue of $981 million grew 12%, marking continued double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year. And while growing revenue and engagement, we continue to demonstrate operational efficiency and disciplined expense management, resulting in Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $365 million, or a 37% margin up more than 1400 basis points from last year. Our strong product delivery in Q4 and throughout 2023, with investments focused in lower funnel offerings like mobile deep linking, shopping ads, API for conversions and most recently direct links are delivering sustained ROI improvements for advertisers. This is leading to advertisers growing their budgets with us and has resulted in further acceleration so far in Q1, which is reflected in our guidance that Julia will describe in further detail later in the call. Before I discuss Q4, I'd like to reflect back on the progress we made over the past year. We entered 2023 with a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and a weak digital ads market. However, we delivered strong execution against the strategic priorities we laid out during the second half of 2022, which enabled us to grow through the downturn and get back to double-digit revenue growth in the back half of 2023. During this period, we made significant investments in AI that drove improvements in our overall platform for users and advertisers and we significantly accelerated product velocity across our most important priorities, propelling growth last year and laying the foundation for the future. We focused on helping users find new reasons to come back to Pinterest more often. We also invested in the elements that made Pinterest so-beloved and unique in the first place, like human curation, through saving and organizing content. And as a result, MAUs are growing and users are engaging more deeply with the platform than before. We also made significant advancements on the shopability of the platform. More than half of our users view Pinterest as a place to shop. But historically, it was not easy to click out and go to a merchant site to buy the product you found on Pinterest. Last year, we improved the shopping experience by bringing shopping content front and center into our home feed, search and related services. As a result, we saw engagement with that shoppable content accelerate, as users clicked and save that content at rates significantly higher than in the past. This was clear evidence to us that people come to Pinterest with intent and will take action when we make it easy for them to do so. On the monetization front, the teams innovated across the entire funnel with particular emphasis in the lower funnel as we made it more seamless for users to pivot from inspiration to action through increased shopability. In fact, 2023 was one of our most productive years for ads innovation, as we accelerated product delivery and launched more ad formats, tools and solutions than ever before and continue to drive adoption of our lower funnel solutions for advertisers. These include seamless handoffs like mobile deep linking and direct links, new ad formats like Premier Spotlight, travel catalogs and lead ads and measurement solutions like our API for conversion and clean room integrations. As a smaller player in the overall digital ads ecosystem, adding third-party demand to increase the comprehensiveness of our catalog and the relevance of our ads was a key priority for us. Last year, we announced and launched our first third-party ad partner with Amazon ads, which is scaling well, and we will continue to advance our third-party demand efforts this year and beyond to bring relevant ads that can enhance the user shopping journey. Putting all this together, we were able to achieve year-over-year revenue growth in every quarter in 2023 and get back to double-digit growth in the second half, and we did this while controlling our costs and expanding margins. When we started the year, we laid out a plan to achieve around 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. With revenue growth, operational rigor and cost optimization, we were able to deliver 660 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for 2023. I believe that constraints bread creativity. And in this environment, our teams are able to deliver better experiences for our users and our advertisers with clarity, focus and discipline. Lastly, with a strong executive team, many of whom joined in 2023, we have the right leadership and a strong foundation to execute against our strategic priorities in 2024 and beyond. Now let's take a closer look at the initiatives we launched in Q4 to advance our strategic priorities. During the quarter, we made key updates along the entire inspiration to action journey to grow our users and deepen engagement. These investments are paying off. We had our fastest global MAU growth since Q1 of 2021, and we're seeing our best product market fit in years, as evidenced by the strong growth in our Gen Z demographic and the fact that our most recent user cohorts are significantly more engaged in user cohorts from prior years, consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day. Starting with inspiration. We're enhancing the way users find inspiring content and hone in on exactly what they're looking for by making improvements to our core search capabilities. In Q4, we began testing generative AI-based search guides which help users to refine their understanding from broad queries like kitchen ideas and to more structured avenues of exploration like Rustic Farmhouse Kitchen or Kitchen Organization Hacks, helping users get closer to the point of action or purchase. Additionally, these generative search guides highlight the advancements we're making in AI on the platform in ways that are additive and authentic to the user and that we expect will lead to continued improvements in engagement and retention. After users search for and find the content they're looking for, we're developing new ways to help users curate that inspirational content. At our Investor Day, we introduced Collages, a new interactive pin format composed of cutouts that users can engage with. Users can tap on an image within a scene to cut out components of the image they love and combine them with other cutouts to create interactive collages of their favorite ideas, all in one place. In addition, users can tap on a cutout within a collage to see its associated products, if available, or the source pin that the object was cutout of. This has the potential to create a flywheel of content creation and engagement, which we're excited about. In Q4, we rolled out the collage functionality to nearly all iOS users globally. I'm pleased that this feature is now broadly available for our users as cutouts in collages are a new frontier of creation on Pinterest and allow users to express their creativity and taste in even more visually immersive ways. It also provides us with great first-party signals on what users are interested in, product associations, emerging trends and how we can surface more content and products that are aligned with users' evolving tastes. And we're seeing strong early results and positive feedback from our users. They're finding collage as highly engaging with users three times more likely to save collage pins versus other pins on Pinterest and the majority of collages are created by users who had not previously created a pin. Collage is also skewed heavily towards shoppable content with approximately 75% of collages utilizing a product pin showing the intent our users bring when creating and engaging with content on Pinterest. Moving further down the inspiration to action journey. We're enhancing our board functionality to help users better understand and organize their tastes. Boards are an essential part of the curation flywheel on Pinterest and provide us with important signals on user tastes and preferences, which feeds into our recommendation algorithm and further augments our ability to serve relevant content back to our users. In Q4, we launched our first auto organization feature. This feature leverages AI to simplify the Board creation process by automatically grouping similar pins into suggested boards based on what users have saved in the past. For users who generally don't curate on the platform, this feature resulted in a nearly 30% lift in boards created, highlighting how auto organization can unlock the magic of Pinterest for more users. Finally, we're making it easier for users to shift from inspiration to action and shop products they discover on Pinterest. Over the past few quarters, we've launched shopping modules that help us further capitalize on our audience who come to Pinterest with intent and improve the shopability of our platform. Last quarter, we discussed a few of these efforts for women's fashion and home decor categories, including shop the look and guided shopping modules, which surface shoppable product pins based on past saving and clicking history. In Q4, we launched Shop Similar for mobile in the same categories. While Shop the Look is activated when a user clicks on a lifestyle image such as a celebrity wearing the latest outfit trends or a beautifully curated living room, Shop Similar is activated when a user clicks on a shoppable product pin from a merchant catalog. It then showcases a carousel of similar product pins across a variety of other brands and price points, complementing the feed of related pins below. We're in the early stages of ramping, and in our experiments, shop similar drove double-digit lift in both outbound clicks and checkouts. I spent the last few moments discussing the key product updates we've made across the funnel to help users find the content that inspires them most and take action on it. The billions of intent signals we get from this on-platform, search, click and curation behavior gives us the unique ability to see trends in real time and predict consumer trends for the upcoming year through our annual Pinterest predicts report. We've had an 80% success rate in predicting future trends four years in a row. Some of our 2024 predictions are already making their way into the cultural conversation through publications like Vogue and Glamour U.K., as celebrities and users embrace Pinterest predict trends like Eclectic Grandpa Fashion Looks or Western Gothic Home Design. Blue Beauty, which predicts Gen Z and millennials will embrace Blue Hughes and their makeup protein is taking off on Pinterest right now with searches related to this trend growing 125% since the report was launched. This year, we're incorporating Pinterest's predicts activations for both consumers and advertisers. In December, for the first time, we took our predicts trends to real life. Opening the doors to our first ever predicts pop-up shop in New York, showcasing immersive displays and shoppable items inspired by the trends. Our predictions allow advertisers to plan ahead for new consumer interest, ensuring their products and ads are ready to meet ramping demand. Advertisers can also sponsor co-branded Pinterest Predicts content on our platform to reach targeted audiences. Pinterest Predicts is a great example of our ability to harness user behavior to show compelling trends in content that drive user engagement and provide advertisers with actionable insights they can't find anywhere else. With that, I'd like to turn to our second strategic priority, improving monetization per user and discuss how we're driving success for advertisers. Throughout 2023, we've been focused on driving performance for advertisers by rolling out our lower funnel tools, which include mobile deep linking, the API for conversions and clean rooms and most recently, Direct Link, which launched at the end of Q3 and ramped in Q4. The percentage of revenue from advertisers who adopted at least three of these tools increased from 2% at the beginning of 2023 to 13% at our Investor Day in September to 23% by the end of the year, marking strong progress toward our goal to be a meaningful performance player in the digital ads market. One of the key product enhancements we've rolled out within the lower funnel suite is Direct Link, which creates a more seamless handoff for advertisers. Direct Link take users to an advertiser's product page in just one click significantly reducing friction and improving the ability to take action. Direct Links also require little to no work by the advertiser to adopt and now cover 80% of our lower funnel revenue, up from 60% in October. We expect coverage to continue to increase over the course of Q1. The increased performance and value we were able to drive for advertisers in Q4 was particularly impressive. We more than doubled the amount of clicks we drove to advertisers year-over-year, a substantial increase during a retailer's most important time of year, and we were able to do so while driving high-quality engagement. Retailers are finding significant performance improvement with this format. For example, Urban Outfitters saw a 132% increase in outbound clicks and a 57% decrease in cost per click with a Direct Links enabled campaign. This is strong tangible evidence that we are creating significant real value for advertisers. This value creation comes in the form of increased clicks, lowered CPCs and therefore, higher return on ad spend from our lower funnel products. Each time we have launched products that created meaningful advertiser value, we have seen budgets shift in our direction in the month and quarters that followed as advertisers were able to see and measure sustained performance. Given that we launched these products throughout the year, with Direct Links rolling out most recently during the holiday shopping period, much of the value capture from these new products is still in front of us, given the lag between value creation and value capture. We've seen the same value creation versus value capture adoption curve play out in our business already with larger, more sophisticated retailers taking advantage of products like mobile deep linking and API for conversion and subsequently growing their spend with us. The cumulative effect of the significant improvement in Pinterest's lower funnel and performance ad capability over the last 18 months is that we are increasingly moving from advertisers experimental and social budgets to their performance budgets, which tend to be larger and more resilient. With our improved lower funnel solutions, we know we're driving more clicks in conversions, but performance is only as good as an advertiser's ability to measure it. Moreover, as the industry goes through additional privacy centric changes this year with the expectation that a major browser will be deprecating third-party cookies, there is heightened urgency from agencies and advertisers to drive adoption of future-proofing measurement tools. From a targeting perspective, we believe we are well positioned relative to others due to the first-party signals we capture through user intent expressed directly on our platform. We are a lean forward platform and relevant ads or content to our users. From a conversion visibility and measurement standpoint, we have a broad suite of solutions, which are becoming indispensable for performance advertisers to measure and optimize the value of their spend. This is why we've been heavily focused on adoption of our API for conversions and clean room solutions and providing more third-party measurement solutions for advertisers. On API for conversions, we've laid the groundwork for more adoption in 2024, including reducing the set up time for advertisers through interface updates, while integrating with 24 partners like LiveRamp, Adobe and Salesforce. Additionally, sophisticated advertisers are seeing the value of investing in clean rooms to measure campaign performance on Pinterest. Recently, a large CPG partner enabled measurement through clean rooms and found that their Pinterest's campaign drove a 16-point lift in incremental sales. We also offer a suite of first-party and third-party measurement tools to plug into advertisers measurement system of truth, whether it's brand and conversion lift studies, platform metrics and insights or highly sophisticated media mix modeling and multitouch attribution studies. As we've discussed on previous earnings calls, we're going through a critical shift in the industry and a top priority for our company is growing the adoption of these alternative measurement solutions this year. To do so, we've implemented new adoption goals into our sales force compensation structure to encourage further advertiser penetration. We're growing our performance optimization team who can help with technical selling, and we're continuing to explore deeper partnerships with agencies and integrations with additional partners. In addition to format and measurement innovations, we remain focused on bringing AI-based automation to the forefront of our campaign creation experience. We have many of the components in place for a fully automated ad system including automatic bidding, campaign budget optimization and whole page optimization, which enables us to surface more relevant and performant [ph] ads when a user expresses commercial intent. These tools drive better results in aggregate for our advertisers. For example, automatic bidding covers 85% of our revenue, and whole page optimization is resulting in greater efficiencies across our full funnel. Reducing the time and effort for advertisers on campaign set up, while improving ROI is top of mind moving forward, and we'll see a steady progression of increased automation and easier add platform functionality throughout this year as we continue to build out these products. Next, I want to provide an update on our third-party demand efforts. Consistent with the time line we laid out at our Investor Day, Amazon ads in the US is live on search and related surfaces. And as of this quarter, we are testing it on the home feed. In addition, we always said we would have multiple partners and the third-party partners would be an important component of our overall international expansion. Today, I'm pleased to announce our next third-party ad integration with Google. This partnership will focus on monetizing several of our currently unmonetized international markets by enabling ads to be served on Pinterest via Google's Ad Manager. We went live a couple of weeks ago, and this is starting to ramp. Third-party ad demand is scaling as we anticipated. And while it was not a significant revenue contributor in Q4, we are now seeing it contribute more meaningfully to our growth this quarter, and we expect that to continue going forward. Our third strategic priority is continued focus on operational rigor and discipline. As I mentioned before, I'm proud of our team's execution here as our operating expenses declined year-over-year, and we grew our EBITDA margins by over 1,400 basis points. Julie will provide more details on our future profitability outlook later in the call. Lastly, I want to spend a few moments discussing a topic that's most importance to this company and to me personally. Since joining Pinterest, I've talked extensively about Pinterest as a positive place online and how maintaining this positivity is a pivotal component of our ethos as a company. It's also a meaningful differentiator for our platform and a core part of our strategy for growing users and advertisers. Users, especially Gen Z, often crave respite from social media and see Pinterest as a positive alternative. Advertisers for their part, want to be present in a positive, brand-safe environment that can also deliver performance. I recently had the opportunity to speak alongside key thought leaders at the inaugural Youth Online Safety Summit hosted by Commonsense Media, a leading advocacy organization working to ensure that the Internet is healthy, safe and empowering for young people. It was an honor to be able to speak alongside the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, about how Pinterest is working to build an alternative social media business model, one that is focused on positivity. We're not perfect, and we don't have all the answers. Like the rest of the industry, we have a long way to go, but it is my intention to make Pinterest a safe place for everyone, especially on people. We're one of the few places online that is about focusing on your own life versus just observing the lives of others, about making plans for what you intend to do. We've taken a radically different stance than our competitors, and we're seeing it pay off in the emotional well-being of our users and in our business outcomes. These principles are at the heart of our technology, our AI and our policies, and we are being accountable and transparent about how we're doing and sharing our learnings across the industry. Our company mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love and our work to make Pinterest a positive corner of the internet is an integral part of how we embody our mission every day. Now I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more about our financial performance. Thanks, Julia. I'm proud of all we were able to achieve in the last year, and I'm even more excited for the year ahead. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Eric. So we also see the broader ad market as stable to improving. For us, Retail was the fastest growing segment. And we're seeing across the entire ad industry, performance matters more than ever, and we're winning on that front. We're driving more performance to advertisers than ever before. As I mentioned in my remarks, large advertisers are opening up their performance budgets for us. Doubling our clicks sent to advertisers year-on-year, a strong indicator of not only the value that we have already created, but of how much more value capture is still left in front of us on that. So we also see that improvement, but performance is the name of the game, and we've made a major progression on performance over the last 18 months. And so those are the comments I'd make offer because Julia wants to add any more on some of the other things that we saw in the market there. Thanks, Ross. Great question. And as we've talked about on the international front, we see Pinterest significantly undermonetized across the board. But the most undermonetized internationally. We have approximately 80% of our users outside the US, but only 20% of our revenue. So as we shared at our Investor Day, we think that's a meaningful opportunity for us to increase that ARPU internationally. At Investor Day, we talked about how we would leverage both 3P, as well as resellers and other partnerships to help us advance there. So, we're quite excited about the partnership with Google as particularly for those unmonetized markets, we think it can help us to accelerate the ARPU journey for those markets and bring more relevant content and actionable content to users in those markets. As we've demonstrated that our users have a commercial intent on our platform, the ads can be great content. You've seen that in our increase of impressions, ad impressions, while also increasing engagement, demonstrating that the ads can be great content when they use it in a commercial context, we think it will also be additive from that perspective as well. Your question on Amazon, we feel really good about the way the Amazon partnership is scaling also. And there are international markets that can be in play there as well. So as we've talked about the 3P strategy overall, we think about 3P as a way to fill in gaps in our auction and bring more relevant content to our users. And so we're quite pleased with the way the Amazon partnership is progressing. And the Google partnership with the focus on our unmonetized or undermonetized international markets, we think will be quite additive as well. Sure, thanks. Thanks, Rich. So video remains more than 30% of our revenue. It's been a bright spot for us on the platform that we are driving really great monetization on video. And we've talked about how much AI is a core competency for us and how much that has driven increases in relevancy on the organic side, as well as improvements on the ad side as well. Our model being 100 times larger than they were a year ago, as we talked about last quarter. And so one of the things we're seeing from that AI-driven improvement in relevancy is a really good ability to discern what's relevant for which user at the right moment in time, and that includes both video and still images. And so we're seeing that work quite well in our fee, the balance between video and still imagery and I think you see it reflected quite well in our progress with users that we just put up our best user growth quarter since Q1 of 2021. We're deepening engagement per user. Gen Z is now our largest fastest-growing demographic. They're very video-centric as well. We are winning with Gen Z. So I think those are all the things I'd point to that say we're really getting the right balance of still imagery versus video with really good multi mobile capabilities and our AI-driven relevancy on those things. Gen Z, the demographic tends to be more video-centric and as we've talked about, we are performing quite well with Gen Z. But interestingly, it's not just video. When we see things like I talked about collages in my comments, we are creating entirely new content types on Pinterest like collages where users can curate, and they've done that historically on board, but collage as now make that an even deeper level of granularity where people can put together outfits and room designs at much greater granularity driven by AI recommendations on those things. And so we're seeing Gen Z really engage deeply with that as well. And as I mentioned in my remarks, not only is that driving engagement it's driving shopping behaviors of 75% plus of those collages that are created contain shoppable products. And so quite pleased with how our team leveraging AI is finding great ways to bring new content types to the right users at the right moment in time, particularly around commercial intent. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Mark. As we talked about at our Investor Day, we've got multiple ways to win here. We've talked about driving better lower funnel performance. We are driving forward on that, performing quite well on that front. We talked about international in 3P. We see those contributing quite nicely as well. And so it is very much a multipronged approach, and we see really solid performance across each of those very much in line with the plans we laid out at our Investor Day. So, in the same way that we talked about multiple ways to win at Investor Day. We see progress on every single one of those fronts, and we see it as a balanced approach, and we continue to see that way as we look into Q1 and next year. Thanks for the question, Ron. So as we've talked about before, we've been on a major transformation from a primarily brand ad-driven platform a couple of years ago to a performance-driven platform today. And we shared at Investor Day two thirds of our revenue now coming from the lower funnel. So we are well down that path on that transformation. At the same time, we are continuing to launch major improvements to our performance ad product and we're on an adoption curve there. So for example, we launched Mobile deep links to GA sort of middle of the year last year. And then we are still seeing more and more retailers not only adopt that, but then shift budget to us as a result of that. With direct links, we launched that as we were right into the holiday shopping season when most of the retailers are sort of hunkered down and that really making major shifts. So we're able to deliver that without the advertiser doing work, and we doubled the number of clicks we sent to advertisers year-on-year. And as we're going into Q1, we're seeing that now start to show up in budget allocations moving to us. But we think we have a lot more of that to go. And to give you a little bit more sense of this, if you looked at our lower funnel performance tools, things like conversion API, mobile deep links, direct links, clean rooms. At the start of last year, we had roughly 2% of our revenue coming from those who have at least three of those lower funnel tools. By Investor Day, that was 13% of our revenue coming from those that had at least three of those lower funnel tools. By the end of the year, it was 23% of our revenue coming from those who had at least three of those lower funnel tools. So that gives you a sense for how we're making strong progress, but also to my comments around how there is a lot more of the value capture still in front of us from products that we have already launched that we know are performing well. And of course, we are continuing to innovate there as well. So a lot more to come on that. Thank you. Certainly, on Gen Z, we've talked about it's more than 40% of our user base now. And there's multiple factors driving the improvement in users and engagement at its core. We're helping users find more of what they're interested in, on Pinterest, helping them take action on it and delivering a positive environment for them that they see as an oasis away from the toxicity of much of the rest of social media. This gets cited to us directly particularly by Gen Z users. And so we are carving out a unique space for ourselves that is quite different from the rest of social media that is more about users investing in themselves. Things are additive to their lives versus sort of viewing the lives of others or that where they feel like they have to perform for others. And so it is a really unique and ownable space, and we're seeing that really cut through with users and again, with advertisers as well to see it as a brand-safe environment. On geographies, as you mentioned, you can see the geographic growth there. The couple of things I'd mention are just on U-Can. We saw, again, another nice, really nice growth quarter there in our mature markets. I've been saying this for the last six quarters. Our mature market is much more about driving depth of engagement, and we feel really good about the depth of engagement that we're driving, particularly actionability on to the platform. You see that reflected in the increase in clicks, where users are taking action on our platform, a big question 18 months ago. Users not only come here with intent, but they are taking action. And internationally, the big question there has always been the monetization. And we have nice momentum there, but we have a lot more that we can do, and we're quite excited about our first-party selling efforts, the things we can do with reseller partners and agencies. We're making progress on those fronts and then bring 3P into the mix there with Google, particularly for those unmonetized and undermonetized markets. We think there's a lot we can do that not only drives the monetization per user, but again, drive that actionability for the user that we think can help further enhance the user engagement for users in those international markets. And on your question on the value capture versus value create. There's always a lag between these things. Advertisers need to see the performance sustain and you see it flow through into their models and their measurement. And so the thing we feel really great about is that, that value - the value create is the hardest part and has to happen first, and we're seeing that as we drive more users with more intent to those advertisers. So that's really fantastic raw material for us. And we've only really just started the value capture on that. And what comes ahead in that is some of that is just advertisers see that bake into their own models of performance. Some of that is about getting advertisers on to privacy safe measurement. Julia talked about, and we started talking about this Q1 - late Q1, I believe, of last year around adopters of API for conversions as a cohort growing at 30%, approximately 30%, those that had not adopted being mid single-digit decliners. That trend continues as we drive that adoption. So as I mentioned in my comments, the performance doesn't matter to the advertisers if they can't see it through their measurement. So driving that adoption curve on measurement matters quite a lot as well. But we're seeing - again, we're seeing that budget shift toward us continue. We saw that through the year this past year, doubling our growth rate from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. We see further acceleration as we look into Q1 as reflected in our guide. And we think there's a lot more of that to go as we continue to drive through that adoption curve. I hope that helps. Yes. Thanks for the question, Colin. So on your first question around MAU, we are seeing progress both in bringing new users to the platform. We talked about Gen Z, where we are winning with Gen Z and they are finding Pinterest quite compelling and unique and different from the rest of social media. So we are bringing new users on the platform like our Gen Z examples. But it's also the case that we are deeply engaged with existing users, giving them more reasons to come back to Pinterest more frequently. And I'd say there's two large drivers in that. One is as we make better and better recommendations. That gives them more reasons to come back and giving them more suggested use cases, helping them to broaden out what they think they can do on Pinterest showing them adjacent use cases. So that's working quite well. And then it's the actionability. As I've said many times before, Pinterest had previously solved digital window shopping, but all the stores were closed, actionability was hard. How good was the digital window shopping, so good that people would keep coming back even though all the stores were closed. But as we open those stores, people have good reason to come back more and more frequently. So the MAU acceleration and the growth there is broad-based and it is both bringing new users on the platform, winning with Gen Z, as well as driving depth of engagement with new adjacent use cases and better actionability that caused users to come back more frequently. On your second question, on relevancy. This is where we just get really amazing first-party signal that feeds AI. AI is only as good as a signal upon which is acting. And we get really amazing signal on what users are interested in. I've talked about Pinterest predicts and our ability to predict there and see trends that are coming because users plan for the future on Pinterest. We see users in their shopping journeys long before that intent has been expressed on other platforms. And so that's really rich signal. As we're leveraging next-gen AI with models that are 100 times larger than they were before, we're seeing really fantastic ability to take that completely unique signal to Pinterest and convert that into great relevant recommendations for users. I shared on our last call that we saw approximately 10 percentage point improvement in relevancy when we move to our large language models. And that flywheel between the user coming and curating, giving a signal of what they're interested in and then us being able to give better and better recommendations to users. We see that flywheel accelerating, particularly as we bring in more actionability. So again, AI is a core competency for us. And importantly, we have a completely unique signal that you wouldn't find elsewhere around the user curation particularly around their commercial intent. And when we see that really just continuing to drive that flywheel as we go forward. Hopefully, that helps. Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going. As always, we hope you enjoy the rest of your day."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations. You may go ahead.\nNeil Doshi: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to Pinterest's earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. I'm Neil Doshi, Head of Investor Relations for Pinterest. Joining me today on the call are Bill Ready, Pinterest's CEO; and Julia Donnelly, our CFO. Now I'll cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our performance, operations and outlook may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, our results, trends and outlook for Q4 2023 and beyond are preliminary and are not an assurance of future performance. We are making these forward-looking statements based on information available to us as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update them later unless required by law. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and presentation, which are distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at investor.pinterestinc.com. Lastly, all growth rates discussed in today's prepared remarks should be considered year-over-year unless otherwise specified. And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Neil, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. We made great progress in Q3, as we accelerated our revenue growth and strengthened our fundamentals. Our efforts in deepening engagement and growing monetization are yielding results. We ended the quarter with 482 million monthly active users, up 8% to an all-time high exceeding our peak users from the pandemic period surge by refocusing on Pinterest's unique differentiators as a visual search, discovery and shopping platform. Total revenue was $763 million, up 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. This represents the third quarter in a row of accelerating revenue growth. Finally, the strong revenue growth, coupled with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $185 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24%, a 1,300 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. Last month, we hosted Pinterest's first ever Investor Day, where we shared an in-depth view of our strategy, the progress we've made to date, and what we're building for the future. It was great to see many of you in person. And if you haven't seen it, you can watch the event on our Investor Relations website. You heard there from many members of our senior management on why Pinterest is unique and different from other platforms, and why we have such a massive opportunity ahead of us. Pinterest users engage in dynamic multi-session journeys that go from inspiration to action. In other words, people are saving and curing ideas and products they hope to make, do or buy today and in the future. That means they easily pick up where they left off every time they use Pinterest with our recommendation getting increasingly relevant each time. These user journeys can span many verticals and include a wide variety of actionable outcomes like freshening up your wardrobe, finding gift ideas or recruiting a travel itinerary. The inspiration to action journey we're furthest along in building a shopping. We know more than half our users view Pinterest as a place to shop. So our focus over the last year has been to make Pinterest more shoppable. When users are in a commercial mindset, we can drive better engagement through highly relevant ads and we can grow monetization by delivering more views, clicks and conversions and customers to our advertising partners, thereby fueling our flywheel for engagement and revenue growth. This ability to have a full funnel for users and advertisers on the same platform provides compounding benefits to both parties and is one of our core differentiators. We also laid out our financial targets for the future, where we expect to drive revenue growth at a mid to high-teens compound annual growth rate and expand our adjusted EBITDA margins to reach the low 30% range in the next three to five years. We plan to achieve this by focusing on three key priorities: growing users and DPA engagement per user, improving monetization and delivering profitable growth through operational rigor. Today, Julia and I will provide you with an update on those priorities. Let's start with our work on growing users and deepening engagement. We continue to use AI to improve the relevance and personalization of our content recommendations and satisfy user intent on our platform through improved shopping experiences. As we noted at our Investor Day, we're seeing strength with our Gen Z users, who are our fastest-growing and most engaged users. We are also seeing our strongest product market fit in years as evidenced by our recent cohorts who saved 2 times more content in their first year on Pinterest relative to older cohorts. Let me walk you through some of the product updates we've made that are driving these outcomes. Among our efforts to deepen engagement with our users is helping users rediscover existing use cases and find new use cases in categories on Pinterest. During the quarter, we launched the More Ideas tab at the top of the home feed to allow users to easily access their board themes and quickly refocus on an ongoing use case. Our AI recommendation engine builds off of the save content from those boards to recommend additional pins that provide users with more points of inspiration, resulting in strong growth and saving on the platform. We also made continued progress on incorporating shopping into the forefront of the user experience on Pinterest, which is driving engagement by helping users seamlessly pick up where they left off from previous sessions and complete their inspiration to action journeys. Our new Shop the Look module, which we launched in Q2, helps users to easily shop what they see in lifestyle images. When a user clicks on one of these lifestyle images, the Shop the Look module will appear as a carousel within the Pin Closeup. Within that module, we employ AI and computer vision to then recommend similar buyable items within our merchant catalog that users can easily shop. In fact, 70% products recommended in Shop the Look are rated as exact or highly relevant matches. We've previously discussed the launch of a new AI-driven guided browsing experience to recommend new content from adjacent use cases based on user interest. In Q3, we expanded our guided browsing modules in the U.S. and Canada region to promote more shopping behavior by resurfacing relevant viable pins based on content users have engaged with in the past. For example, if you previously saved or clicked on a leather jacket and a pair of boots, we can serve a personalized carousel on the home feed resurfacing those same pins or related items to encourage you to continue your shopping journey. These improvements enable us to show users shoppable content aligned with their interests with seamless hand-offs to the merchant app or website that users can easily purchase. Next, I'd like to discuss how we're improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full funnel platform. The continued innovation in our ad stack across formats, tools and measurement solutions enables us to improve performance for our advertisers and grow our revenue. At the lower end of the funnel, which now makes up roughly two-thirds of our revenue, we are focused on helping advertisers gain clicks, conversions and customers. On past earnings calls, we discussed the success we're seeing with Mobile Deep Links, or MDL, where advertisers can now direct link users directly into the relevant product page and checkout experience in their mobile app. This is a great solution for merchants who have stand-alone apps with broad consumer penetration. As we've noted before, MDL is performing extremely well in our tests. Participating advertisers saw a 235% lift in conversion rates, along with a 35% improvement in their CPAs. We're now bringing this solution to those advertisers who either don't have an app or rely primarily on their website for traffic and sales. This product is called Direct Links, which we launched in Q3. I'd like to spend a moment to dive deeper into Direct Links and why I believe this can become a significant unlock for advertiser value. Direct Link brings a user experience similar to MDL to merchant websites taking the user from an add-on Pinterest directly to a product purchase experience on the merchant website in just one click. This simplified experience creates a more seamless shopping journey for the user and drives more website traffic and conversions for the advertiser. So far, we've migrated approximately 60% of our lower funnel revenue to Direct Links and have seen strong results. As we noted at our Investor Day, we saw 88% higher outbound click-through rates and a 39% decrease in cost per outbound click for CPC objectives from early adopters. We plan to roll Direct Links out to the remaining eligible lower funnel objectives, including CPC video ads and conversion ads by the end of Q1 '24 to increase our penetration of Direct Links and lower funnel revenue. On the video side, we believe bringing Direct Links to video will be an important unlock for us given the strength we're seeing with video ads on the platform, especially in the lower funnel. And for conversion objectives, results from initial testing have been very strong driving similarly substantial results as we saw with CPC campaigns. In addition to lower funnel innovation, this year, we continued to launch new formats building on our strength at the top of the funnel, such as Premier Spotlight, showcase and quiz ads (ph). These formats help brands interact with the user and tell their story in an engaging way. In Q3, we expanded our Premier Spotlight ads from search to the home feed, and we are seeing good traction from this ad unit among brand advertisers. For example, Madelin Canada leveraged both Premier Spotlight on the home feed and search to promote their new concealer. This high-impact format drove a 2 times higher video completion rate versus the average video campaign. Not only are we driving full funnel outcomes for advertisers. We are also helping them measure the value that Pinterest uniquely delivers in privacy safe ways. This is a critical element to our success, especially, as we look towards a cookie-less future. We continue to move along the adoption curve for our API for conversions product. Adoption for this product comes from two avenues, direct implementation with advertisers and partner integrations. Our sales force continues to make great strides in getting advertisers to integrate with our API for conversions, with revenue coverage being a top-level goal across the sales organization. We are also integrating with partners that many of our advertisers plug into. For instance, in Q3, we onboarded several partners like Adobe Commerce and Salesforce Commerce Cloud to help drive more adoption of API for conversions. Integrating with partners allows us to meet advertisers where they are and enables a more frictionless experience and improving conversion visibility. For example, PacSun, a leading U.S. based retailer that is popular with Gen Z, seamlessly adopted our API for conversions through our new Salesforce Commerce Cloud app. After installing API for conversions, PacSun saw a 7 times increase in attributed conversion rate. And as we mentioned during our Investor Day, we are making solid progress here. Our API for conversion solution accounted for 28% of our total revenue as of August, up from 14% at the start of the year. In addition to helping advertisers measure the value of Pinterest, we're also working towards fundamentally improving our ability to show the right ad to the right user at the right time, which feeds into the overall performance of our ads. We've long said that ads, when relevant, are additive to the user experience. This year, we've made step function modeling improvements to better match ads to the users for whom they are most engaging and relevant. And as we flex up ad load with whole page optimization, we're able to serve more of these relevant ads to users who are displaying commercial intent, all while simultaneously growing engagement on the platform. For example, in Q2, we expanded our use of GPU serving to our monetization engine, which enabled us to use models that were 100 times larger. As a result, we're able to better use our first-party user signals to understand commercial intent and thus show more relevant ads to match that intent. In Q3, we began leveraging a longer history of users on-platform behaviors in our ads models. Longer user history means more user signals, which in turn enables us to better predict and surface ads tailored to our users' preferences and tastes. On search specifically, we made improvements in our ability to match relevant ads to user search queries. By utilizing AI and large language models, we were able to more precisely link product metadata to user queries to show ads that are visually and contextually relevant. These two launches drove meaningful improvements across cost per click and cost per action and better ad relevance. Improved capabilities in our ad delivery model are also important as we think about augmenting our first-party sales efforts. Opening up our platform to third-party ad partners will allow us to accelerate monetization by improving ad relevance and auction density. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, our first 3P partnership with Amazon Ads is ramping ahead of schedule and we are pleased with early results with over 50% improvement in relevance on search and a 100% improvement in relevance on related items in early tests. We noted that we were testing this on search in the U.S., and we are now beginning to roll out this test on our related item surface in the U.S. as well. Consistent with our prior comments on this topic, A partnership of this scale is a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue impact likely being in early 2024. Our extensive upfront work integrating third-party demand into our platform has laid the groundwork for more streamlined integrations of potential additional third-party partners in the future. Finally, we're continuing to drive operational rigor through further cost discipline, which resulted in strong EBITDA and EBITDA margin expansion again this quarter. We are tracking nicely toward our mid to long-term margin expansion goals. I'm proud of our teams for all their hard work and execution this past quarter, the results of which are abundantly clear. I'll now turn the call over to Julia, who will provide further updates on our financials.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our preliminary fourth quarter outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. To echo Bill's sentiment, I am proud of our team's execution, which resulted in a great quarter, marked by strong monthly active user growth, continued revenue acceleration and significant year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. It is clear that the strategic shifts we have implemented in our business over the last year leaning into the differentiators of our platform and accelerating our ads product velocity are resonating with users and advertisers alike. We ended the quarter with 482 million global monthly active users, growing 8% and reaching a new all-time high. Our investments in increasing shopability and deploying AI across our recommendation engine are paying off. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 96 million monthly active users, up 1% year-over-year and we added approximately 1 million users versus last quarter. In Europe, we finished the quarter with 128 million monthly active users, up 7%, an acceleration from last quarter. In our rest of world markets, monthly active users were 258 million, up 12%, continuing the trend of acceleration throughout 2023. Now to revenue. The strength we saw this quarter further demonstrates how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel. Total revenue came in at $763 million, up 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in overall revenue was driven by our awareness objectives and conversion objectives, including our lowest funnel shopping ads format. In the U.S. and Canada, revenue was $618 million, an increase of 8%, accelerating to the highest growth we've seen since Q3 '22. Strength came from CPG, retail and certain emerging categories like financial services and restaurants. Europe revenue was $114 million, growing 33%, or 25% on a constant currency basis. We experienced strong growth across CPG, emerging verticals such as travel, technology and auto and from large agencies. Revenue from Rest of World was $31 million, growing 29% or 28% on a constant currency basis. It is also useful to look at revenue through the lens of ad impressions and ad pricing trends. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, ad impressions growth is driven by total impressions, both organic and paid and ad load. Over the last several quarters, we've been able to drive increases in both total impressions and in ad loads simultaneously, thereby demonstrating that relevant ads can be synergistic with engagement. In Q3, we continued this trend with ad impressions growing 26%, driven from both increases in total impressions and increases in ad load. Meanwhile, the price of ads declined 12% this quarter. While pricing still remains under pressure, this is an improvement from the 20% decline we saw last quarter, driven by industry-wide demand stabilization as well as the AI-fueled ad stack efficiencies we drove on the platform in Q3. Now let's turn to expenses. Cost of revenue was $167 million, down 7% year-over-year and roughly flat versus Q2. This result is due to efficiencies being driven across storage and compute infrastructure, even amidst our strong user and engagement growth and continued AI deployment throughout our business. Overall, non-GAAP operating expense was $415 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. This outperformed our expectations and is a reflection of our overall focus on expense management as we realized additional cost savings in the quarter on lower spend in technology and outside services. We have been pleased by our ability to drive double-digit revenue growth even as operating expenses declined year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA had a strong quarter, coming in at $185 million or a 24% margin, up 13 percentage points versus a year ago, driven by strong revenue performance, efficiency in our cost of revenue and the year-over-year decline in operating expenses. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Now I'd like to provide preliminary financial guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2023, we expect revenue to grow in the 11% to 13% range, continuing the trajectory of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth throughout 2023. Our revenue guidance also takes into account a modest foreign exchange impact. Moving down the P&L. While we don't guide cost of revenue specifically, we do want to remind everyone that cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue typically runs lower in Q4 due to the higher seasonal revenue we see in the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to decline in the 9% to 13% range year-over-year as we lap our large brand marketing campaign in Q4 last year. Please note that our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. Finally, our focus on revenue growth and operational rigor has allowed us to meaningfully expand adjusted EBITDA margins over the course of this year. At the beginning of this year, we committed to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year for full year 2023. As the year progressed, we felt confident in our ability to exceed 200 basis points based on our expense discipline, and we doubled our commitment to roughly 400 basis points. Based on our progress in accelerating revenue growth and further controlling costs, we now expect to see significant adjusted EBITDA margin expansion again in Q4, which would put us on track to achieve approximately 600 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for full year 2023. To close, our Q3 performance tells an impressive story, significant monthly active user growth, strong and accelerating revenue generation and effective cost management. all of which continues to put us on the path to deliver on the longer-term financial targets we recently provided. I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Julia. We've made great progress across our business in the past year, and we're just getting started. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration and to shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions and thanks for the details and prepared remarks. Maybe two, if I can. Bill, this year has been dominated by elements of some of the headwinds the advertising industry has faced, brand advertising, the macroeconomic conditions. How would you characterize the headwinds from those dynamics versus the tailwinds building on the shopping and the direct response side, when you think about the exit velocity investors should have in mind in terms of revenue moving out of 2023 and into 2024? And then Julie, at the Investor Day, we talked a lot about long-term margin potential, can you balance the margin potential you see in the business against some of the investments that you and Bill see as critical to make in the short to medium term to set up for that revenue success? Thanks so much.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks for the question, Eric. So in terms of the broader ad environment, we've seen some stabilization there. And for us, particularly, retail has been an area of strength. I think it's been most pronounced with the larger, more sophisticated advertisers. And in addition to that stabilization in the broader ad market, as we've been improving our performance solutions, particularly at the lower funnel and better measurement. I think that's been reflected in our results with steady acceleration each quarter. And so you saw that in our Q3 results. You see it reflected in our Q4 guide as well around that study acceleration. And I'll give it over to Julia for the other part of your question.\nJulia Donnelly: Yeah, Eric. So thanks so much for the question. So as we think about kind of margin expansion potential from here. Maybe stepping back for a minute, we feel really good about the progress we've made so far in delivering margin expansion. We started the year with a 200 basis points margin expansion goal and we're on track now to triple that to 600 basis points for 2023. You're right that at Investor Day, we said we plan to get to the low 30s percent range in three to five years from now and we get there with a steady progression. We are still planning for that. This year, the combination of revenue acceleration and cost discipline led to outperformance on margin expansion. However, there are a lot of investment opportunities with high ROI, particularly in staffing sort of our R&D and product focus and technology areas that we want to fund as we think about balancing investment in the business and capturing the opportunity ahead of us, and flowing through profitability to the bottom line. So given that for next year, we're not specific guidance, but we do expect further margin expansion that will be more modest than the 600 basis points we are delivering this year in particular. And overall, we remain committed to steadily expanding our margins as we march up to that low 30% range over the next three to five years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, Bill. For Bill or Julia, just going back to the Investor Day, there was a slide, I believe it was in Julia's section that showed kind of these colored bar charts around how much of the growth has been coming from ad load increase versus usage growth following the WPO change. And the question is, as we bring on Amazon and other third-party partners in the future, what do you think of the sustainability of that trend of increasing ad load? And is that a multiple year dynamic? How do you see that playing out as we bring on more demand? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Ross. So as we've discussed, we have more than half the users on Pinterest, and you say they're here to shop. And when they use it in a commercial mindset, relevant ads can be great content for the user. And so you've seen us proving that out over the course of the last year. And when we think about the third-party partnerships, we talked about this at Investor Day, and the progress we've seen so far, one of the most encouraging things we've seen as we're bringing on third-party demand with our Amazon ads partnership is the strong improvement in relevance. So we noted at Investor Day that we saw a 50% improvement in relevance on search. And as we're coming into related items, we're seeing 100% improvement on related items from that third-party demand. So the analogs that I have say to me that over a multiyear journey, our ad load when they use it in a commercial context, can be a multiple of what it is today. And that's being driven by both improvements in the platform as well as getting the right relevant demand onto the platforms. And we've made continued progress in both. But we see a multiyear period there without can continue. I'd also highlight just the dynamic of -- as we've been doing at the best proof point that we're turning the ads in the relevant content for users, is that even as we've taken ad load up, you've seen -- we've seen all of our measures of engagement growing faster than the user growth, which means we're deepening engagement per user, even as ad load grows at a multiple of -- or grows faster than the engager. So I think that's the best proof point that as we bring in the right relevant ads for that user in the commercial context, that's -- they're finding that as engaging content.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thank you. First, just on the partner monetization, it sounds like Amazon is progressing faster than you guys expected and good early results. Remind us what the big outstanding blocks you need to get through to scale that with other partners and with other partners and then is there any of the acceleration in 4Q coming from Amazon? And then the second one would just be more broadly on generative AI. You guys have a lot of interesting user data, content, context like anything you're working on interesting on the consumer-facing side for generative AI that you want to call out? Thanks.\nWilliam Ready: Great. Thanks for the question. So with the Amazon partnership, we gave an update just two weeks before the end of the quarter at our Investor Day. And what we've continued to see is consistent with the comments we made there, and as a reminder, what we talked about at Investor Day, we see really good progress. We're testing, learning, iterating and we're focused on creating a really great relevant user experience and valuable merchant experience. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing on that front. That's the biggest breakthrough and this is demonstrating the increase in relevancy from bringing on third-party demand. As I noted in the prior question, 50% increase in relevance on search and 100% increase in relevance on related items, I that just bodes really well for where we can go with that. So those are the biggest things to solve for. As we've been calling out, it is a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue to hit early in '24. So that's with regard to your question on Amazon. The other part of your question around potential new partners. We've commented on this from early on that part of what made us a multi-quarter implementation is that we were fitting the platform for third-party demand generally, not just one partner. So that sets us up well to expand to other partners as we go into '24. And we've been really focused on making sure we get this first one really right, but we have built it in such a way that we think it sets us up well to expand to additional partners as we go into '24. And then on the generative AI front, it's -- AI generally has been a really great source of strength for us. And the places that we've talked about where our use of large language models, 100 times larger models, GPU serving all these great AI technologies, giving us significant increases in relevance, approximately 10 percentage point increase in relevance we talked about on last quarter's call and at Investor Day. So that's been going really well. And the newer products like our creative studio that is creating dynamic content for ads, for advertisers to make those ads more compelling and engaging for users. We're early in our testing there, but we've seen just a palpable response from advertisers in terms of their excitement about engaging with that product and the things that we can do there. And then finally, other elements of the core experience. There's just really nice improvements happening throughout the core user experience that maybe more subtle as a user, but actually driving really great results like guided search experiences, getting you to more related items. These are things where we're seeing just areas where you would normally see progress on basis point. I mentioned that approximately 10% increase in relevancy. That's a place you normally see improvements in basis points to say, 10% -- approximately 10 percentage points improvement in relevancy there. Those kinds of gains are just unheard of. And so we feel really good about the progress that we're making with AI and large language models and the core technologies there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please proceed.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks, Bill and Julia for taking the question. I got a couple. One, just -- I want to follow up, Bill, you were talking about sort of the, I guess, you called it the compounding benefit to both Pinterest and your content and advertising partners on ad load and how it's not impacting engagement. What does that tell you in terms of like, does that imply that there's still lots of room to run in terms of what the ad load could be? I mean you sort of framed it as I think you were about to say multiples and then you sort of said it was the percentage increase. But I'm just wondering, is there any way to frame how much is ad load up? And as you sort of see the engagement benefits from better targeting of ads and content do you think that there is multiples to go in terms of ad load over the course of the next several years? And then two, just because I've been using Pinterest a lot over the last few months and one of the things I certainly noticed is the presence of Timo (ph), wondering if there's any way you can sort of quantify, has Timo been a major advertiser year-over-year? How much of an impact has it had positively on your business year-over-year, would be helpful just to put it into context.\nWilliam Ready: Great. Thanks for the question, Rich. So stated very simply, there's a lot of room to run on ad load, again, both through the unlock of whole paid optimization and our ability to look at the ads of relevant content as well as being able to ingest more relevant third-party demand as well as getting more first-party demand as our advertisers, particularly retailers are seeing more performance from us and wanting to bring more relevant inventory onto the platform. We think there's a lot of room to run there. Over a multiyear period, the analogs that I would have in my mind would say to me that when the users in a commercial context on our platform, which again more than half users are here to shop, but when they use it in a commercial context I think the analogs I would look to would say that we could support a multiple of the ad load that we currently have. That will be a multiyear journey to get to that. But I think that means there's just a lot of runway in front of us on where ad load can go. And the key proof points that I would have had in my mind coming in five quarters ago, were really around whole page optimization, proving out that the users wanted to shop and would engage all the way through the lower funnel and the ability to bring in more demand rapidly and all those major unlocks, we have progressed quite nicely on all those, but there's a lot more runway to go to get to get all the goodness out of that. That will be a multiyear journey, which is why we feel confident in our prospects as we look forward. And then on the other part of your question on Timo (ph), our strength in retail has been broad-based. So if you looked at our strength in retail, the largest advertisers, the larger, more sophisticated advertisers they've been seeing really great results from our latest product developments and they have been leading into the platform, each of our largest, most sophisticated advertisers across retail have been growing faster than the growth rate of our revenue overall. So they're leaning in and contributing to growth. And then Timo has been a nice -- I will not comment on any one specific, but just sort of Asian e-commerce exporters generally have been a nice contributor to that. But we don't feel particularly concentrated or exposed given that our strength in retail has been very broad-based.\nNeil Doshi: Operator next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, excuse me. The first one, at the Analyst Day, you gave that great chart where you sort of showed the growth in engagement versus that basket of saves and impressions versus the DAU versus the mile growth. Can you just update us for how fast that engagement grew in the quarter? I think it was up 14% in 2Q just for context. How quickly was it up in 3Q? And then the second one, you have a lot of different monetization sort of irons in the fire. Can you sort of walk through some of the key technological hurdles you still have to overcome for direct links and deep links as we think about those fully rolling out throughout 2024?\nJulia Donnelly: Yes. Thanks, Brian, for the question. I'll take the first part and maybe kick it over to Bill for the second part of your question. So we did see engagement trends continue the same trends that we showed at Investor Day. So we talked about strong engagement growth on the call. We also talked about the increase in ad impressions of 26% being driven by both total impressions growth increasing and ad load increasing. So the same trend of ongoing engagement growth across the basket of metrics that we monitor and talked about on Investor Day, continues to hold for Q3 specifically. And now Bill for the second part.\nWilliam Ready: Yeah. So this is actually a really great area, Brian, in terms of what's required to implement our lower funnel solutions here and how that's going. So Mobile Deep Links, which had has had really great results and been, 235% lift in conversion rates, which is really experienced taking the user from Pinterest, straight into the product and buying experience in a retailer's mobile app. But there's a lot of retail that may not have users on their mobile app. And so with Direct Link, we're now taking that a similar experience that will drop the user straight into a product and/or purchase experience with the retailer's website or mobile website, and we're deploying that very rapidly. And we're actually able to deploy that even faster than mobile deep links. So we now have approximately 60% of our revenue of our lower funnel revenue has been migrated to direct links. And so the value creation of that has really been tremendous. We talked about 88% higher outbound click-through rate and 39% decrease in cost per outbound click. That's just really phenomenal value creation for the advertiser. And so advertisers have been seeing that. The other thing to note is that we are still in the beginning of capturing the value from that because we started rolling that out sort of in the back half of Q3. And I shared some comments as to how we're continuing to roll that out into Q4 and even into Q1, and we have our measurement progress that lets the advertisers measure all that goodness that they're seeing. So the shift of budgets that can result from that, I think while we have really accelerated the value creation for the advertiser, and they're really pleased with what they're seeing. I'd say we're still early on in capturing the value from that. So I think there's a lot of tailwind to that deployment as we continue forward into Q4 and in the next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Two questions, please. The growth in MAUs was most pronounced in ROW -- the rest of the world regions. Any particular markets there or countries you would call out there? Is there something that suggests that, that growth is there's a new growth element in ROW? And then secondly, I think two other companies have talked about seeing a little bit of a pause in ad spend due to geopolitical factors earlier in the quarter? Are you seeing anything like that? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: So I'll take the second part of your question first, Mark, and thanks for the questions. So before I get to that, actually, I want to just take a moment to acknowledge the tragic situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza. While Pinterest doesn't have employees there our thoughts are definitely with all those that are affected truly beyond words, the situation there. So with regard to the impact of the geopolitical situation, advertisers do react to major geopolitical situations. But spending on our platform has been relatively resilient so far in the quarter. When the Middle East conflict broke out, some brand advertisers did temporarily pause spend, and this resulted in a minor short-term impact. But we've since seen those advertisers largely return. And if the geopolitical environment were to get materially worse, we'd expect that brand advertising would be more at risk and performance ads would be more resilient. So platform skewed more to brand would be more impacted than we would be given the progress we've made in the lower funnel. But if advertisers pull back spend in a more meaningful way than what we've seen so far, we're not going to be immune to that. But taking into account everything we know today and what we've seen so far, we feel good about our ability to execute in the quarter, bolstered by our recent product improvements at the lower end of the funnel, which is factored into our Q4 guidance. And then on the math side, it continues to be a story of mature markets where it's a story of deepening engagement in mature markets. And then broad-based strength, as you look to rest of world, we're getting more and more relevant results. A lot of these things we're talking about in great improvement and relevancy using next-gen AI technology. These are things that are having a global impact in mature markets where we've seen a lot of the users that we need to see that manifest as deepening engagement per user. As you look to rest of world, you see even more mile growth happening in those markets.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. At the Analyst Day, you talked about launching a fully automated ad tool in 2024, similar to some of the other large platforms. I was just hoping you could provide an update on that? Perhaps any commentary just around how the build progress is going there? That's all. Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the question. So we're really pleased with our progress on that front. If you think about sort of the fully automated tools out there, we have most of the components that you'd want to see in that. And we're now bringing those together into a more comprehensive solution. So if you looked at -- are bidding now, we'd have a significant majority of our revenue. It would be using -- is using automated bidding today. As we look forward into '24, as we progress through the year, we're going to be giving advertisers more ability to basically give us targets, give us creative and then leave it to us to go drive campaign results for them. And so we feel like we're making really great progress there. And so we think that's another positive factor as we look forward into '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Post with Bank of America. Anthony has dropped from the call. So our next question will be from Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for the question. I have two, please. Bill, you talked about when you're talking about engagement in newer use cases, improvements in users picking up where they left off in prior sessions, talk just more about how that connected search improves overall engagement rates and just the impact to overall use cases? And then with mobile deep linking fully launched in July, love to hear just more insights on overall adoption now or GA. And particularly, I think I heard you say we launched Direct Link in 3Q, but there's more to go. So any insights on MDL and Direct Link would be helpful. Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yeah. So on this sort of picking up on Journeys, they're multi session. One of the things I think people may not fully appreciate is that a significant portion of commercial journeys are, in fact, multi-session. And if you were to look over the shoulder of a user that's shopping, the way this would manifest as you'd see 30 or 40 browser chats opened at a time, oftentimes, which is reflective of how users think about these shopping sessions as multi-session experiences. This is a real core strength of Pinterest, like that pain point of having 30 or 40 browser tabs open at once. That's sort of a core pain point that Pinterest solves. And so as users are saving on our platform at an increasing rate, we talked about our most recent cohorts being approximately twice as engaged as past cohorts and saving being a core element of that. As we're making that experience easier and better for the users to go save those journeys with us, come back and pick up where they left off and get great recommendations like taking the example I gave us taking the jacket and the shoes that you saved, but then coming back and not only do you get more recommendations about that, but things if you go with it are things are relevant to your style. We're seeing that really play well with users and give you the more reasons to come back to Pinterest, more frequently for their shopping needs. And so we feel really excited about the results there, but we still have a lot more that we can go forward with. But it's a core strength of Pinterest. And it's really unique to our platform, fundamentally different than what users would do on other platforms. And so as we're leaning into that, we're seeing a differentiation assign through more and more. And then on Mobile Deep Links and Direct Links, the great news with Direct Link is that we've been able to deploy that more easily for retailers without them having to do work on their end. They still need to do work to measure and then to reallocate budgets. But our ability to go deliver them more clicks, we then will do that without work by the advertisers, particularly with retailers that we're getting into shopping. And so that 88% lift in clicks that we noted is a tremendous value creation for the advertisers. And as we look forward, and they're getting that -- they're seeing that come through in their measurement models and they're thinking about budget, we see a lot of that value capture is still in front of us, even though we're moving very rapidly on the value creation for the advertiser.\nRonald Josey: Thank you, Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. A couple for me as well. I guess, first off, when you look at the incremental revenues on the platform, I'm curious how much of that growth is from new advertisers versus just higher budget allocation from existing advertisers? And then secondly, apologies if I missed this, but did you provide an update for Q4 to date on API for conversions, the penetration rate across revenues in the platform? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yeah. So on your first question, we've seen certainly a nice mix of new advertisers coming in as well as they're seeing compelling results. But as I noted in my prior comments, our strength, particularly in retail has been broad-based. And we've actually seen the larger, more sophisticated advertisers have been at the core of that. And so seeing those most sophisticated advertisers are seeing great performance from us. There is a cohort growing faster than our revenue overall. In fact, across all of our large sophisticated advertisers, particularly in retail, we're seeing them growing faster than our revenue growth rate overall. So I think that bodes really well for just how our lower funnel performance-oriented solutions are driving value for advertisers and that's working well with large retailers. It's also helping to bring in emerging categories as well. To comment on some of those emerging categories like travel and financial services and others. And so there are new advertisers coming on to the platform as well. But retail has been the largest contributor to our growth, and driven particularly by larger sophisticated advertisers, which we always say, if you can make them happy, you can make just about anybody happy. And so we expect that, that trend of other advertisers coming in or leaning more into the platform will only continue.\nJulia Donnelly: And then, Collin, to your second question about the sort of penetration update on API for conversion. So we did not update that stat simply because we just gave it to you all last month at Investor Day. So just a reminder there, at that time, we said that as of August, 28% of total revenue has adopted the API for conversions app, which is up from 14% at the start of the year. So continuing to see nice progress there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelley with Stifel. You may proceed.\nMark Kelley: Great. Thanks very much. I have two quick ones. The first one is just on just the importance of whether it's Amazon or other third-party demand partners that you bring on over time. I guess how important are those partnerships to international expansion? Does that make it easier, partnering with a tech provider that's kind of widely adopted? That's the first one. And then the second one, just a follow-up on API for conversions. Is that something that you expect to kind of slowly increase in terms of adoption and then kind of a rush at the last minute when cookies are deprecated on Chrome? I guess what's the path forward bigger picture?\nWilliam Ready: Thanks for the questions, Mark. So on your first question there, we've not talked about -- there's no specific new announcements around third-party for international anything like that. But we have talked about how we are significantly undermonetized internationally and that as we look forward, and think about how 3P could help with our business overall, international is definitely a place that we think third-party demand can be particularly helpful. We had some comments on this in Investor Day, both around third parties around working with resellers internationally, all of which can help accelerate our progress. international. So that's definitely something that we're focusing on as we go into next year is driving greater ARPU internationally given our under monetization there. And we see third-party as a contributor to that, along with other efforts like resellers and other things that can bring relevant demand onto the platform internationally. And then on Cappy (ph), to your point, as we go into '24, I think we've seen, as we look back towards the larger, more sophisticated advertisers have been at the earlier end of the adoption curve on these things. But as we look into '24 and there'll be -- that has been stated, desire to make further progress by browser -- major browser providers and deprecating cookies. I think that will create more forcing function for the industry as we go into '24. So I don't have a better crystal ball than anybody else, but I do think as we move toward that cookie less future that will create some forcing function for advertisers to implement privacy safe measurement. And then I think the other thing just as we face a cookies future, we talked about this, we think the industry broadly is in a similar boat around the implement privacy safe measurement tools. But we think platforms are in very different boats as it pertains to being able to serve relevant ads to users and stated very simply, Pinterest doesn't need to follow users around the Internet to know what they're interested in. Users come on Pinterest and tell us what they're interested in. So our ability to serve great relevant ads to users is driven by what users do on our platform, correctly by our first a signal. And so we think we're positioned quite well as it pertains to delivering great relevant ads for users even as we move into a cookie less future. And then on the measurement side, yes, the industry I suspect we'll continue to accelerate the adoption of those prove safe management tools as we go into '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nTom Champion: Good afternoon. Bill, on Amazon, is there any sensitivity to managing the existing 1P advertiser base when layering on a major partner or additional partners in the future? Is there any impact to existing advertiser price or ROI or any trade-off there to keep in mind? And then Julia, maybe for you, just curious if you could discuss the very strong revenue growth in Europe in 3Q. Any call outs there? Anything to monitor on the regulatory front there as well? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Tom, for the questions. To your point on 1P versus 3P, I think you're sort of getting out, like is there a channel complex kind of issue there. And we've not really seen that surface. What we've really seen surface, and I think this is evidenced by the meaningful increase in relevance is that we're really seeing a lot of new demand that's coming through that. You would have the relevancy increases if you weren't seeing new demand that wasn't already on the platform. So that's really been the highlight so far is that it's making it so that there's new relevant demand showing up on our platform, which is why it's been so engaged in positive for users. So we've not seen any particular concern there, certainly something we would watch for and pay attention to. We actually think these things are quite synergistic with one another. And then I'll give it over to...\nJulia Donnelly: Yes. So Tom, on your question on sort of European growth in Q3 specifically. So we did see some strong growth there from CPG and also from emerging verticals such as technology and the auto vertical. But this was also amplified by strong growth with agencies. As we've talked about, historically, agencies play a differential role in the European market specifically. Some of it was also, to be fair, a little bit of an easier comp in Q3 of last year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. And so I think that's something also that's worth calling out and no major impact that we see today in our business or expect on the regulatory front either.\nOperator: Thank you. This was the last question for today's call. So I will now hand the call over to Bill Ready for closing remarks.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going, and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes today's Pinterest third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our preliminary fourth quarter outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. To echo Bill's sentiment, I am proud of our team's execution, which resulted in a great quarter, marked by strong monthly active user growth, continued revenue acceleration and significant year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. It is clear that the strategic shifts we have implemented in our business over the last year leaning into the differentiators of our platform and accelerating our ads product velocity are resonating with users and advertisers alike. We ended the quarter with 482 million global monthly active users, growing 8% and reaching a new all-time high. Our investments in increasing shopability and deploying AI across our recommendation engine are paying off. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 96 million monthly active users, up 1% year-over-year and we added approximately 1 million users versus last quarter. In Europe, we finished the quarter with 128 million monthly active users, up 7%, an acceleration from last quarter. In our rest of world markets, monthly active users were 258 million, up 12%, continuing the trend of acceleration throughout 2023. Now to revenue. The strength we saw this quarter further demonstrates how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel. Total revenue came in at $763 million, up 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in overall revenue was driven by our awareness objectives and conversion objectives, including our lowest funnel shopping ads format. In the U.S. and Canada, revenue was $618 million, an increase of 8%, accelerating to the highest growth we've seen since Q3 '22. Strength came from CPG, retail and certain emerging categories like financial services and restaurants. Europe revenue was $114 million, growing 33%, or 25% on a constant currency basis. We experienced strong growth across CPG, emerging verticals such as travel, technology and auto and from large agencies. Revenue from Rest of World was $31 million, growing 29% or 28% on a constant currency basis. It is also useful to look at revenue through the lens of ad impressions and ad pricing trends. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, ad impressions growth is driven by total impressions, both organic and paid and ad load. Over the last several quarters, we've been able to drive increases in both total impressions and in ad loads simultaneously, thereby demonstrating that relevant ads can be synergistic with engagement. In Q3, we continued this trend with ad impressions growing 26%, driven from both increases in total impressions and increases in ad load. Meanwhile, the price of ads declined 12% this quarter. While pricing still remains under pressure, this is an improvement from the 20% decline we saw last quarter, driven by industry-wide demand stabilization as well as the AI-fueled ad stack efficiencies we drove on the platform in Q3. Now let's turn to expenses. Cost of revenue was $167 million, down 7% year-over-year and roughly flat versus Q2. This result is due to efficiencies being driven across storage and compute infrastructure, even amidst our strong user and engagement growth and continued AI deployment throughout our business. Overall, non-GAAP operating expense was $415 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. This outperformed our expectations and is a reflection of our overall focus on expense management as we realized additional cost savings in the quarter on lower spend in technology and outside services. We have been pleased by our ability to drive double-digit revenue growth even as operating expenses declined year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA had a strong quarter, coming in at $185 million or a 24% margin, up 13 percentage points versus a year ago, driven by strong revenue performance, efficiency in our cost of revenue and the year-over-year decline in operating expenses. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Now I'd like to provide preliminary financial guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2023, we expect revenue to grow in the 11% to 13% range, continuing the trajectory of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth throughout 2023. Our revenue guidance also takes into account a modest foreign exchange impact. Moving down the P&L. While we don't guide cost of revenue specifically, we do want to remind everyone that cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue typically runs lower in Q4 due to the higher seasonal revenue we see in the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to decline in the 9% to 13% range year-over-year as we lap our large brand marketing campaign in Q4 last year. Please note that our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. Finally, our focus on revenue growth and operational rigor has allowed us to meaningfully expand adjusted EBITDA margins over the course of this year. At the beginning of this year, we committed to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year for full year 2023. As the year progressed, we felt confident in our ability to exceed 200 basis points based on our expense discipline, and we doubled our commitment to roughly 400 basis points. Based on our progress in accelerating revenue growth and further controlling costs, we now expect to see significant adjusted EBITDA margin expansion again in Q4, which would put us on track to achieve approximately 600 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for full year 2023. To close, our Q3 performance tells an impressive story, significant monthly active user growth, strong and accelerating revenue generation and effective cost management. all of which continues to put us on the path to deliver on the longer-term financial targets we recently provided. I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Yeah, Eric. So thanks so much for the question. So as we think about kind of margin expansion potential from here. Maybe stepping back for a minute, we feel really good about the progress we've made so far in delivering margin expansion. We started the year with a 200 basis points margin expansion goal and we're on track now to triple that to 600 basis points for 2023. You're right that at Investor Day, we said we plan to get to the low 30s percent range in three to five years from now and we get there with a steady progression. We are still planning for that. This year, the combination of revenue acceleration and cost discipline led to outperformance on margin expansion. However, there are a lot of investment opportunities with high ROI, particularly in staffing sort of our R&D and product focus and technology areas that we want to fund as we think about balancing investment in the business and capturing the opportunity ahead of us, and flowing through profitability to the bottom line. So given that for next year, we're not specific guidance, but we do expect further margin expansion that will be more modest than the 600 basis points we are delivering this year in particular. And overall, we remain committed to steadily expanding our margins as we march up to that low 30% range over the next three to five years. Yes. Thanks, Brian, for the question. I'll take the first part and maybe kick it over to Bill for the second part of your question. So we did see engagement trends continue the same trends that we showed at Investor Day. So we talked about strong engagement growth on the call. We also talked about the increase in ad impressions of 26% being driven by both total impressions growth increasing and ad load increasing. So the same trend of ongoing engagement growth across the basket of metrics that we monitor and talked about on Investor Day, continues to hold for Q3 specifically. And now Bill for the second part. And then, Collin, to your second question about the sort of penetration update on API for conversion. So we did not update that stat simply because we just gave it to you all last month at Investor Day. So just a reminder there, at that time, we said that as of August, 28% of total revenue has adopted the API for conversions app, which is up from 14% at the start of the year. So continuing to see nice progress there. Yes. So Tom, on your question on sort of European growth in Q3 specifically. So we did see some strong growth there from CPG and also from emerging verticals such as technology and the auto vertical. But this was also amplified by strong growth with agencies. As we've talked about, historically, agencies play a differential role in the European market specifically. Some of it was also, to be fair, a little bit of an easier comp in Q3 of last year, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. And so I think that's something also that's worth calling out and no major impact that we see today in our business or expect on the regulatory front either."

            "name": "William Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. We made great progress in Q3, as we accelerated our revenue growth and strengthened our fundamentals. Our efforts in deepening engagement and growing monetization are yielding results. We ended the quarter with 482 million monthly active users, up 8% to an all-time high exceeding our peak users from the pandemic period surge by refocusing on Pinterest's unique differentiators as a visual search, discovery and shopping platform. Total revenue was $763 million, up 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. This represents the third quarter in a row of accelerating revenue growth. Finally, the strong revenue growth, coupled with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $185 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24%, a 1,300 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. Last month, we hosted Pinterest's first ever Investor Day, where we shared an in-depth view of our strategy, the progress we've made to date, and what we're building for the future. It was great to see many of you in person. And if you haven't seen it, you can watch the event on our Investor Relations website. You heard there from many members of our senior management on why Pinterest is unique and different from other platforms, and why we have such a massive opportunity ahead of us. Pinterest users engage in dynamic multi-session journeys that go from inspiration to action. In other words, people are saving and curing ideas and products they hope to make, do or buy today and in the future. That means they easily pick up where they left off every time they use Pinterest with our recommendation getting increasingly relevant each time. These user journeys can span many verticals and include a wide variety of actionable outcomes like freshening up your wardrobe, finding gift ideas or recruiting a travel itinerary. The inspiration to action journey we're furthest along in building a shopping. We know more than half our users view Pinterest as a place to shop. So our focus over the last year has been to make Pinterest more shoppable. When users are in a commercial mindset, we can drive better engagement through highly relevant ads and we can grow monetization by delivering more views, clicks and conversions and customers to our advertising partners, thereby fueling our flywheel for engagement and revenue growth. This ability to have a full funnel for users and advertisers on the same platform provides compounding benefits to both parties and is one of our core differentiators. We also laid out our financial targets for the future, where we expect to drive revenue growth at a mid to high-teens compound annual growth rate and expand our adjusted EBITDA margins to reach the low 30% range in the next three to five years. We plan to achieve this by focusing on three key priorities: growing users and DPA engagement per user, improving monetization and delivering profitable growth through operational rigor. Today, Julia and I will provide you with an update on those priorities. Let's start with our work on growing users and deepening engagement. We continue to use AI to improve the relevance and personalization of our content recommendations and satisfy user intent on our platform through improved shopping experiences. As we noted at our Investor Day, we're seeing strength with our Gen Z users, who are our fastest-growing and most engaged users. We are also seeing our strongest product market fit in years as evidenced by our recent cohorts who saved 2 times more content in their first year on Pinterest relative to older cohorts. Let me walk you through some of the product updates we've made that are driving these outcomes. Among our efforts to deepen engagement with our users is helping users rediscover existing use cases and find new use cases in categories on Pinterest. During the quarter, we launched the More Ideas tab at the top of the home feed to allow users to easily access their board themes and quickly refocus on an ongoing use case. Our AI recommendation engine builds off of the save content from those boards to recommend additional pins that provide users with more points of inspiration, resulting in strong growth and saving on the platform. We also made continued progress on incorporating shopping into the forefront of the user experience on Pinterest, which is driving engagement by helping users seamlessly pick up where they left off from previous sessions and complete their inspiration to action journeys. Our new Shop the Look module, which we launched in Q2, helps users to easily shop what they see in lifestyle images. When a user clicks on one of these lifestyle images, the Shop the Look module will appear as a carousel within the Pin Closeup. Within that module, we employ AI and computer vision to then recommend similar buyable items within our merchant catalog that users can easily shop. In fact, 70% products recommended in Shop the Look are rated as exact or highly relevant matches. We've previously discussed the launch of a new AI-driven guided browsing experience to recommend new content from adjacent use cases based on user interest. In Q3, we expanded our guided browsing modules in the U.S. and Canada region to promote more shopping behavior by resurfacing relevant viable pins based on content users have engaged with in the past. For example, if you previously saved or clicked on a leather jacket and a pair of boots, we can serve a personalized carousel on the home feed resurfacing those same pins or related items to encourage you to continue your shopping journey. These improvements enable us to show users shoppable content aligned with their interests with seamless hand-offs to the merchant app or website that users can easily purchase. Next, I'd like to discuss how we're improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full funnel platform. The continued innovation in our ad stack across formats, tools and measurement solutions enables us to improve performance for our advertisers and grow our revenue. At the lower end of the funnel, which now makes up roughly two-thirds of our revenue, we are focused on helping advertisers gain clicks, conversions and customers. On past earnings calls, we discussed the success we're seeing with Mobile Deep Links, or MDL, where advertisers can now direct link users directly into the relevant product page and checkout experience in their mobile app. This is a great solution for merchants who have stand-alone apps with broad consumer penetration. As we've noted before, MDL is performing extremely well in our tests. Participating advertisers saw a 235% lift in conversion rates, along with a 35% improvement in their CPAs. We're now bringing this solution to those advertisers who either don't have an app or rely primarily on their website for traffic and sales. This product is called Direct Links, which we launched in Q3. I'd like to spend a moment to dive deeper into Direct Links and why I believe this can become a significant unlock for advertiser value. Direct Link brings a user experience similar to MDL to merchant websites taking the user from an add-on Pinterest directly to a product purchase experience on the merchant website in just one click. This simplified experience creates a more seamless shopping journey for the user and drives more website traffic and conversions for the advertiser. So far, we've migrated approximately 60% of our lower funnel revenue to Direct Links and have seen strong results. As we noted at our Investor Day, we saw 88% higher outbound click-through rates and a 39% decrease in cost per outbound click for CPC objectives from early adopters. We plan to roll Direct Links out to the remaining eligible lower funnel objectives, including CPC video ads and conversion ads by the end of Q1 '24 to increase our penetration of Direct Links and lower funnel revenue. On the video side, we believe bringing Direct Links to video will be an important unlock for us given the strength we're seeing with video ads on the platform, especially in the lower funnel. And for conversion objectives, results from initial testing have been very strong driving similarly substantial results as we saw with CPC campaigns. In addition to lower funnel innovation, this year, we continued to launch new formats building on our strength at the top of the funnel, such as Premier Spotlight, showcase and quiz ads (ph). These formats help brands interact with the user and tell their story in an engaging way. In Q3, we expanded our Premier Spotlight ads from search to the home feed, and we are seeing good traction from this ad unit among brand advertisers. For example, Madelin Canada leveraged both Premier Spotlight on the home feed and search to promote their new concealer. This high-impact format drove a 2 times higher video completion rate versus the average video campaign. Not only are we driving full funnel outcomes for advertisers. We are also helping them measure the value that Pinterest uniquely delivers in privacy safe ways. This is a critical element to our success, especially, as we look towards a cookie-less future. We continue to move along the adoption curve for our API for conversions product. Adoption for this product comes from two avenues, direct implementation with advertisers and partner integrations. Our sales force continues to make great strides in getting advertisers to integrate with our API for conversions, with revenue coverage being a top-level goal across the sales organization. We are also integrating with partners that many of our advertisers plug into. For instance, in Q3, we onboarded several partners like Adobe Commerce and Salesforce Commerce Cloud to help drive more adoption of API for conversions. Integrating with partners allows us to meet advertisers where they are and enables a more frictionless experience and improving conversion visibility. For example, PacSun, a leading U.S. based retailer that is popular with Gen Z, seamlessly adopted our API for conversions through our new Salesforce Commerce Cloud app. After installing API for conversions, PacSun saw a 7 times increase in attributed conversion rate. And as we mentioned during our Investor Day, we are making solid progress here. Our API for conversion solution accounted for 28% of our total revenue as of August, up from 14% at the start of the year. In addition to helping advertisers measure the value of Pinterest, we're also working towards fundamentally improving our ability to show the right ad to the right user at the right time, which feeds into the overall performance of our ads. We've long said that ads, when relevant, are additive to the user experience. This year, we've made step function modeling improvements to better match ads to the users for whom they are most engaging and relevant. And as we flex up ad load with whole page optimization, we're able to serve more of these relevant ads to users who are displaying commercial intent, all while simultaneously growing engagement on the platform. For example, in Q2, we expanded our use of GPU serving to our monetization engine, which enabled us to use models that were 100 times larger. As a result, we're able to better use our first-party user signals to understand commercial intent and thus show more relevant ads to match that intent. In Q3, we began leveraging a longer history of users on-platform behaviors in our ads models. Longer user history means more user signals, which in turn enables us to better predict and surface ads tailored to our users' preferences and tastes. On search specifically, we made improvements in our ability to match relevant ads to user search queries. By utilizing AI and large language models, we were able to more precisely link product metadata to user queries to show ads that are visually and contextually relevant. These two launches drove meaningful improvements across cost per click and cost per action and better ad relevance. Improved capabilities in our ad delivery model are also important as we think about augmenting our first-party sales efforts. Opening up our platform to third-party ad partners will allow us to accelerate monetization by improving ad relevance and auction density. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, our first 3P partnership with Amazon Ads is ramping ahead of schedule and we are pleased with early results with over 50% improvement in relevance on search and a 100% improvement in relevance on related items in early tests. We noted that we were testing this on search in the U.S., and we are now beginning to roll out this test on our related item surface in the U.S. as well. Consistent with our prior comments on this topic, A partnership of this scale is a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue impact likely being in early 2024. Our extensive upfront work integrating third-party demand into our platform has laid the groundwork for more streamlined integrations of potential additional third-party partners in the future. Finally, we're continuing to drive operational rigor through further cost discipline, which resulted in strong EBITDA and EBITDA margin expansion again this quarter. We are tracking nicely toward our mid to long-term margin expansion goals. I'm proud of our teams for all their hard work and execution this past quarter, the results of which are abundantly clear. I'll now turn the call over to Julia, who will provide further updates on our financials. Thanks, Julia. We've made great progress across our business in the past year, and we're just getting started. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration and to shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Thanks for the question, Eric. So in terms of the broader ad environment, we've seen some stabilization there. And for us, particularly, retail has been an area of strength. I think it's been most pronounced with the larger, more sophisticated advertisers. And in addition to that stabilization in the broader ad market, as we've been improving our performance solutions, particularly at the lower funnel and better measurement. I think that's been reflected in our results with steady acceleration each quarter. And so you saw that in our Q3 results. You see it reflected in our Q4 guide as well around that study acceleration. And I'll give it over to Julia for the other part of your question. Thanks, Ross. So as we've discussed, we have more than half the users on Pinterest, and you say they're here to shop. And when they use it in a commercial mindset, relevant ads can be great content for the user. And so you've seen us proving that out over the course of the last year. And when we think about the third-party partnerships, we talked about this at Investor Day, and the progress we've seen so far, one of the most encouraging things we've seen as we're bringing on third-party demand with our Amazon ads partnership is the strong improvement in relevance. So we noted at Investor Day that we saw a 50% improvement in relevance on search. And as we're coming into related items, we're seeing 100% improvement on related items from that third-party demand. So the analogs that I have say to me that over a multiyear journey, our ad load when they use it in a commercial context, can be a multiple of what it is today. And that's being driven by both improvements in the platform as well as getting the right relevant demand onto the platforms. And we've made continued progress in both. But we see a multiyear period there without can continue. I'd also highlight just the dynamic of -- as we've been doing at the best proof point that we're turning the ads in the relevant content for users, is that even as we've taken ad load up, you've seen -- we've seen all of our measures of engagement growing faster than the user growth, which means we're deepening engagement per user, even as ad load grows at a multiple of -- or grows faster than the engager. So I think that's the best proof point that as we bring in the right relevant ads for that user in the commercial context, that's -- they're finding that as engaging content. Great. Thanks for the question. So with the Amazon partnership, we gave an update just two weeks before the end of the quarter at our Investor Day. And what we've continued to see is consistent with the comments we made there, and as a reminder, what we talked about at Investor Day, we see really good progress. We're testing, learning, iterating and we're focused on creating a really great relevant user experience and valuable merchant experience. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing on that front. That's the biggest breakthrough and this is demonstrating the increase in relevancy from bringing on third-party demand. As I noted in the prior question, 50% increase in relevance on search and 100% increase in relevance on related items, I that just bodes really well for where we can go with that. So those are the biggest things to solve for. As we've been calling out, it is a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue to hit early in '24. So that's with regard to your question on Amazon. The other part of your question around potential new partners. We've commented on this from early on that part of what made us a multi-quarter implementation is that we were fitting the platform for third-party demand generally, not just one partner. So that sets us up well to expand to other partners as we go into '24. And we've been really focused on making sure we get this first one really right, but we have built it in such a way that we think it sets us up well to expand to additional partners as we go into '24. And then on the generative AI front, it's -- AI generally has been a really great source of strength for us. And the places that we've talked about where our use of large language models, 100 times larger models, GPU serving all these great AI technologies, giving us significant increases in relevance, approximately 10 percentage point increase in relevance we talked about on last quarter's call and at Investor Day. So that's been going really well. And the newer products like our creative studio that is creating dynamic content for ads, for advertisers to make those ads more compelling and engaging for users. We're early in our testing there, but we've seen just a palpable response from advertisers in terms of their excitement about engaging with that product and the things that we can do there. And then finally, other elements of the core experience. There's just really nice improvements happening throughout the core user experience that maybe more subtle as a user, but actually driving really great results like guided search experiences, getting you to more related items. These are things where we're seeing just areas where you would normally see progress on basis point. I mentioned that approximately 10% increase in relevancy. That's a place you normally see improvements in basis points to say, 10% -- approximately 10 percentage points improvement in relevancy there. Those kinds of gains are just unheard of. And so we feel really good about the progress that we're making with AI and large language models and the core technologies there. Great. Thanks for the question, Rich. So stated very simply, there's a lot of room to run on ad load, again, both through the unlock of whole paid optimization and our ability to look at the ads of relevant content as well as being able to ingest more relevant third-party demand as well as getting more first-party demand as our advertisers, particularly retailers are seeing more performance from us and wanting to bring more relevant inventory onto the platform. We think there's a lot of room to run there. Over a multiyear period, the analogs that I would have in my mind would say to me that when the users in a commercial context on our platform, which again more than half users are here to shop, but when they use it in a commercial context I think the analogs I would look to would say that we could support a multiple of the ad load that we currently have. That will be a multiyear journey to get to that. But I think that means there's just a lot of runway in front of us on where ad load can go. And the key proof points that I would have had in my mind coming in five quarters ago, were really around whole page optimization, proving out that the users wanted to shop and would engage all the way through the lower funnel and the ability to bring in more demand rapidly and all those major unlocks, we have progressed quite nicely on all those, but there's a lot more runway to go to get to get all the goodness out of that. That will be a multiyear journey, which is why we feel confident in our prospects as we look forward. And then on the other part of your question on Timo (ph), our strength in retail has been broad-based. So if you looked at our strength in retail, the largest advertisers, the larger, more sophisticated advertisers they've been seeing really great results from our latest product developments and they have been leading into the platform, each of our largest, most sophisticated advertisers across retail have been growing faster than the growth rate of our revenue overall. So they're leaning in and contributing to growth. And then Timo has been a nice -- I will not comment on any one specific, but just sort of Asian e-commerce exporters generally have been a nice contributor to that. But we don't feel particularly concentrated or exposed given that our strength in retail has been very broad-based. Yeah. So this is actually a really great area, Brian, in terms of what's required to implement our lower funnel solutions here and how that's going. So Mobile Deep Links, which had has had really great results and been, 235% lift in conversion rates, which is really experienced taking the user from Pinterest, straight into the product and buying experience in a retailer's mobile app. But there's a lot of retail that may not have users on their mobile app. And so with Direct Link, we're now taking that a similar experience that will drop the user straight into a product and/or purchase experience with the retailer's website or mobile website, and we're deploying that very rapidly. And we're actually able to deploy that even faster than mobile deep links. So we now have approximately 60% of our revenue of our lower funnel revenue has been migrated to direct links. And so the value creation of that has really been tremendous. We talked about 88% higher outbound click-through rate and 39% decrease in cost per outbound click. That's just really phenomenal value creation for the advertiser. And so advertisers have been seeing that. The other thing to note is that we are still in the beginning of capturing the value from that because we started rolling that out sort of in the back half of Q3. And I shared some comments as to how we're continuing to roll that out into Q4 and even into Q1, and we have our measurement progress that lets the advertisers measure all that goodness that they're seeing. So the shift of budgets that can result from that, I think while we have really accelerated the value creation for the advertiser, and they're really pleased with what they're seeing. I'd say we're still early on in capturing the value from that. So I think there's a lot of tailwind to that deployment as we continue forward into Q4 and in the next year. So I'll take the second part of your question first, Mark, and thanks for the questions. So before I get to that, actually, I want to just take a moment to acknowledge the tragic situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza. While Pinterest doesn't have employees there our thoughts are definitely with all those that are affected truly beyond words, the situation there. So with regard to the impact of the geopolitical situation, advertisers do react to major geopolitical situations. But spending on our platform has been relatively resilient so far in the quarter. When the Middle East conflict broke out, some brand advertisers did temporarily pause spend, and this resulted in a minor short-term impact. But we've since seen those advertisers largely return. And if the geopolitical environment were to get materially worse, we'd expect that brand advertising would be more at risk and performance ads would be more resilient. So platform skewed more to brand would be more impacted than we would be given the progress we've made in the lower funnel. But if advertisers pull back spend in a more meaningful way than what we've seen so far, we're not going to be immune to that. But taking into account everything we know today and what we've seen so far, we feel good about our ability to execute in the quarter, bolstered by our recent product improvements at the lower end of the funnel, which is factored into our Q4 guidance. And then on the math side, it continues to be a story of mature markets where it's a story of deepening engagement in mature markets. And then broad-based strength, as you look to rest of world, we're getting more and more relevant results. A lot of these things we're talking about in great improvement and relevancy using next-gen AI technology. These are things that are having a global impact in mature markets where we've seen a lot of the users that we need to see that manifest as deepening engagement per user. As you look to rest of world, you see even more mile growth happening in those markets. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the question. So we're really pleased with our progress on that front. If you think about sort of the fully automated tools out there, we have most of the components that you'd want to see in that. And we're now bringing those together into a more comprehensive solution. So if you looked at -- are bidding now, we'd have a significant majority of our revenue. It would be using -- is using automated bidding today. As we look forward into '24, as we progress through the year, we're going to be giving advertisers more ability to basically give us targets, give us creative and then leave it to us to go drive campaign results for them. And so we feel like we're making really great progress there. And so we think that's another positive factor as we look forward into '24. Yeah. So on this sort of picking up on Journeys, they're multi session. One of the things I think people may not fully appreciate is that a significant portion of commercial journeys are, in fact, multi-session. And if you were to look over the shoulder of a user that's shopping, the way this would manifest as you'd see 30 or 40 browser chats opened at a time, oftentimes, which is reflective of how users think about these shopping sessions as multi-session experiences. This is a real core strength of Pinterest, like that pain point of having 30 or 40 browser tabs open at once. That's sort of a core pain point that Pinterest solves. And so as users are saving on our platform at an increasing rate, we talked about our most recent cohorts being approximately twice as engaged as past cohorts and saving being a core element of that. As we're making that experience easier and better for the users to go save those journeys with us, come back and pick up where they left off and get great recommendations like taking the example I gave us taking the jacket and the shoes that you saved, but then coming back and not only do you get more recommendations about that, but things if you go with it are things are relevant to your style. We're seeing that really play well with users and give you the more reasons to come back to Pinterest, more frequently for their shopping needs. And so we feel really excited about the results there, but we still have a lot more that we can go forward with. But it's a core strength of Pinterest. And it's really unique to our platform, fundamentally different than what users would do on other platforms. And so as we're leaning into that, we're seeing a differentiation assign through more and more. And then on Mobile Deep Links and Direct Links, the great news with Direct Link is that we've been able to deploy that more easily for retailers without them having to do work on their end. They still need to do work to measure and then to reallocate budgets. But our ability to go deliver them more clicks, we then will do that without work by the advertisers, particularly with retailers that we're getting into shopping. And so that 88% lift in clicks that we noted is a tremendous value creation for the advertisers. And as we look forward, and they're getting that -- they're seeing that come through in their measurement models and they're thinking about budget, we see a lot of that value capture is still in front of us, even though we're moving very rapidly on the value creation for the advertiser. Thank you. Yeah. So on your first question, we've seen certainly a nice mix of new advertisers coming in as well as they're seeing compelling results. But as I noted in my prior comments, our strength, particularly in retail has been broad-based. And we've actually seen the larger, more sophisticated advertisers have been at the core of that. And so seeing those most sophisticated advertisers are seeing great performance from us. There is a cohort growing faster than our revenue overall. In fact, across all of our large sophisticated advertisers, particularly in retail, we're seeing them growing faster than our revenue growth rate overall. So I think that bodes really well for just how our lower funnel performance-oriented solutions are driving value for advertisers and that's working well with large retailers. It's also helping to bring in emerging categories as well. To comment on some of those emerging categories like travel and financial services and others. And so there are new advertisers coming on to the platform as well. But retail has been the largest contributor to our growth, and driven particularly by larger sophisticated advertisers, which we always say, if you can make them happy, you can make just about anybody happy. And so we expect that, that trend of other advertisers coming in or leaning more into the platform will only continue. Thanks for the questions, Mark. So on your first question there, we've not talked about -- there's no specific new announcements around third-party for international anything like that. But we have talked about how we are significantly undermonetized internationally and that as we look forward, and think about how 3P could help with our business overall, international is definitely a place that we think third-party demand can be particularly helpful. We had some comments on this in Investor Day, both around third parties around working with resellers internationally, all of which can help accelerate our progress. international. So that's definitely something that we're focusing on as we go into next year is driving greater ARPU internationally given our under monetization there. And we see third-party as a contributor to that, along with other efforts like resellers and other things that can bring relevant demand onto the platform internationally. And then on Cappy (ph), to your point, as we go into '24, I think we've seen, as we look back towards the larger, more sophisticated advertisers have been at the earlier end of the adoption curve on these things. But as we look into '24 and there'll be -- that has been stated, desire to make further progress by browser -- major browser providers and deprecating cookies. I think that will create more forcing function for the industry as we go into '24. So I don't have a better crystal ball than anybody else, but I do think as we move toward that cookie less future that will create some forcing function for advertisers to implement privacy safe measurement. And then I think the other thing just as we face a cookies future, we talked about this, we think the industry broadly is in a similar boat around the implement privacy safe measurement tools. But we think platforms are in very different boats as it pertains to being able to serve relevant ads to users and stated very simply, Pinterest doesn't need to follow users around the Internet to know what they're interested in. Users come on Pinterest and tell us what they're interested in. So our ability to serve great relevant ads to users is driven by what users do on our platform, correctly by our first a signal. And so we think we're positioned quite well as it pertains to delivering great relevant ads for users even as we move into a cookie less future. And then on the measurement side, yes, the industry I suspect we'll continue to accelerate the adoption of those prove safe management tools as we go into '24. Thanks, Tom, for the questions. To your point on 1P versus 3P, I think you're sort of getting out, like is there a channel complex kind of issue there. And we've not really seen that surface. What we've really seen surface, and I think this is evidenced by the meaningful increase in relevance is that we're really seeing a lot of new demand that's coming through that. You would have the relevancy increases if you weren't seeing new demand that wasn't already on the platform. So that's really been the highlight so far is that it's making it so that there's new relevant demand showing up on our platform, which is why it's been so engaged in positive for users. So we've not seen any particular concern there, certainly something we would watch for and pay attention to. We actually think these things are quite synergistic with one another. And then I'll give it over to... Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going, and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day."

And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Neil, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Q2 was a solid quarter marked by strong growth across our business. We're seeing ongoing momentum, giving us continued confidence that our strategy is yielding results with more potential as we look ahead. We ended the quarter with 465 million MAUs, up 8%. Our total revenue was $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We stay disciplined with our expenses and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $107 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. Before we dive into the key highlights from Q2, I'd like to share more about what we've accomplished over the last year since I joined and why I'm excited for the opportunities ahead. During this time, we've become laser-focused on our strategy of building upon our core differentiators and visual discovery to help our users go from inspiration to action. With that focus on our strategic priorities, we've successfully returned to strong user and engagement growth while delivering consistent year-on-year revenue growth and returning to margin expansion despite the downturn in the advertising environment. On the engagement side, we've utilized next-generation AI technologies to service more relevant and personalized content and improve ad relevance, driven more intent to action and focused our content strategy to bring actionable content from a range of sources, including users, creators, publishers and retailers. As a result, monthly active users have grown more than 30 million over the last 12 months. Our users are also coming back more frequently and are engaging more deeply. Engagement metrics such as sessions, impressions and saves grew substantially faster than our users across all of our regions over the same period. It's worth noting that we have seen these engagement gains over the past year during a period where we have also grown our ad load on the platform, proving that relevant ads, including lower funnel ad formats can be good content for users in a unique setting like ours with high commercial intent. We continue to see significant benefits and momentum from whole page optimization and ongoing improvements to our ads quality, targeting and relevancy. We increased our focus on making Pinterest more shoppable by integrating shopping into the core experiences of our platform. We're now seeing strong growth and engagement with shopping related content on our core surfaces. And for the past four quarters, shopping ads revenue has grown multiples of our total revenue growth. I believe we are just scratching the surface when it comes to monetizing lower funnel behavior on Pinterest. Importantly, we also accelerated innovation on behalf of our advertisers, tripling the number of ad product formats released so far this year versus last and introducing important measurement solutions that prove our value to advertisers. We are seeing revenue from advertisers who take advantage of these measurement tools to grow significantly faster, a positive sign for the future as we increase adoption of these tools among our customer base. We also opened our platform to third-party demand partners, starting with Amazon Ads platform. To summarize, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished over the last year, and we're just getting started. We look forward to sharing more details and a comprehensive update on our strategy during our Investor Day, taking place in San Francisco on September 19. With that backdrop, I'll now move on to the progress we've made in the second quarter, advancing our strategic priorities and driving the business forward. First, I'd like to discuss how we are deepening engagement with our existing users and growing new users in Q2, driven by our AI efforts in relevance and personalization as well as a clear focus on satisfaction of user intent. In Q2, our global MAUs grew 8%, while our mobile app MAUs, which account for over 80% of our revenue and impressions grew 16%. In addition, our U-Can mobile app MAUs grew 9%, accelerating from Q1. Our users were also visiting us more frequently. The basket of metrics that we use to measure engagement, such as sessions, impressions and saves grew significantly faster than MAUs in Q2 in all regions, consistent with the trends we have observed the last four quarters. To help bring this to life, I'd like to share a few examples of how we are driving engagement on the platform, starting with how we are implementing AI to better serve our users. Nearly a year ago, we began moving to next-gen AI capabilities, enabling us to use recommender models that were 100 times larger than before. We combined our first-party proprietary data with our AI-based computer vision and search technologies to improve the perceived relevance for recommendations on related pens, driving proceed relevance up by nearly 10 points from a year ago to 94%. This means that when users are searching for something on Pinterest, we are returning results that they find relevant and helpful and we're doing this with a very high degree of accuracy. More recently, as we have continued to focus on what our users really want from us, we've incorporated into our AI models more signals from our platform. As an example, in the first half of this year, we unlocked further engagement gains by incorporating propensity to share into our AI recommender models. By recommending content that users are more likely to share, we improved retention of our core users, and we grew revisits from dormant users as they are more likely to engage with recommended content from people they know. In Q2, another source of engagement gains came from the launch of our new guided browsing experience designed to help episodic users rediscover existing use cases and find their next project or passion on Pinterest. This experience adds a set of horizontal images across the home feeds grid where we can show more content based on the user's intent. The valuable signals we get from this new browsing module helps optimize the user experience for previous or new use cases and deliver more relevant shopping experiences We've seen a meaningful lift in revisitation as a result. As we continue to focus on improving the inspiration to action journey for users across our platform, we're seeing users explore more interest outside of our core home, food, fashion and beauty verticals, with strong growth in the number of MAUs engaging with emerging verticals such as men's fashion, auto, health and travel in the first half of this year. Lastly, we continue to see strong growth with Gen Z users on Pinterest who in Q2 were our largest contributor to overall engagement growth and the fastest growing cohort growing double digits and accounting for a larger portion of our overall mix. In particular, we found that our Gen Z users consistently engage more deeply on the platform than our older cohorts as measured by their saves and close up activity on the platform. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full funnel platform. These ad offerings allow us to reach a broader set of advertisers to diversify and grow our revenue base and also help us deliver improved results to our advertisers based on their performance criteria. First, let's start with how we are innovating at the lower end of the funnel, where we are helping retailers gain customers, not just transactions. In July, we brought our mobile deep linking product or MDL to general availability, opening up this highly performant offering to more advertisers. MDL is a great fit for retailers who want to drive users to purchase an item on their mobile app and has been a significant driver of our shopping ads revenue growth over the past 9 months. By taking what we've learned through MDL, we are planning to expand our lower funnel offerings to include more seamless one-click site handoffs in the back half of this year. This gives retailers who don't have a stand-alone app or prefer to do a one-click hand off directly to their site, the flexibility to choose what works best for their objectives. Travel catalogs are another format we debuted in the quarter, allowing advertisers to reach users who are in the midst of planning, organizing and taking action on their travel dreams. It's built on our product catalog technology and automatically turns each listing into a dynamic product pen with relevant booking information such as hotel name, pricing, images and descriptions. As an example, TUI, one of the world's leading tourism groups based in Germany added travel catalogs to their full funnel strategy to drive more users to their available hotel listings. In Q2, their campaign yielded strong results with a 6 times higher outbound click-through rate and an 80% lower outbound cost per click than they were seeing in previous conversion campaigns. Furthermore, we made good headway with helping advertisers measure the efficacy of their campaigns on Pinterest. Since introducing our conversion API in Q4, we've steadily grown the percentage of revenue from advertisers who adopted our conversion API solution. In addition to innovating on the lower funnel, we've also continued to innovate on upper funnel ad formats to build on our strength in that segment of the market and meet advertiser demand. In June, we made our Premier Spotlight ad format, which is our upper funnel takeover video ad unit on our search surface available for all advertisers. We're seeing early adoption from a large number of brand advertisers such as MAX, formerly known as HBOMax and Comcast XFINITY. Similar to last quarter, in Q2, we continued to drive a more than 30% increase in our global ad impressions or monetizable supply due to engagement gains and dynamically flexing ad load when a user is expressing intent through whole page optimization. We are also leveraging next-gen AI on our ad products, and we're seeing a profound impact in our ad capabilities. In Q2, we expanded our use of GPU serving from core engagement AI models to our ad delivery models, which enabled us to use models that are 100 times larger than before in ads as well as organic. The cumulative impact was a 5% reduction in cost per action and over 10% lift in click-through rates. I'm very proud of our team's execution on the monetization side, but we are still early in our ad platform evolution. I believe third-party partnerships can be additive by expanding the depth of advertisers bringing more relevant ads and improving our auction density. We announced our first third-party partnership with Amazon Ads in April. This partnership has strong synergies as Pinterest has significant commercial intent and consumer desire to go from inspiration to action while Amazon ads can bring more shoppable content with a great consumer buying experience. As I said on our last call, a partnership of this scale will be a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue impact likely being in early 2024. However, we have recently begun testing live traffic with Amazon ads. We are very pleased with the pace of implementation in Q2 and the early results of our testing in Q3 so far. Looking at our overall progress on shopping, we're quite excited at the momentum we're generating. We're building a powerful flywheel that is driving increased engagement among our users and delivering greater value to our advertisers. We're utilizing next-gen AI models with our first-party signal to recommend brands and products that are aligned with user preferences, and this is resonating with users. In Q1, we continued to grow the overall distribution of shopable 10 [ph] or products you can take action on, on the home feed. And in Q2, we've expanded this to all of our core surfaces. Users are actively engaging with this content with click-through rates and saves of shoppable 10 growing over 50%, accelerating from the 35% we saw in Q1. In Q2, we also launched a new automated shop-to-look module for home decor and fashion pens that utilizes AI to recommend similar shoppable products tied to our merchant catalogs. In our early A/B tests, Shop the - look is unlocking greater value for merchants as this high-intent traffic drove a 9% increase in conversions. And these innovations continue to manifest in robust shopping ads revenue, which continue to grow at a pace meaningfully faster than our overall revenue rate. Now I'd like to discuss our focus on operational rigor. As we've said in the past, we're instilling a culture where we are more focused on what drives results for users and advertisers and being more rigorous with our expenses, ultimately making us a more durable company. We've been able to accelerate our pace of innovation while also being disciplined on expense management, resulting in positive outcomes for our users, advertisers and shareholders. In Q1, we took steps to reduce our expenses and drive greater efficiencies in our business, including rightsizing our workforce to align talent to our strategic priorities and restructuring our real estate portfolio. In Q2, we identified further cost efficiencies, leading to operating expenses that were lower than we guided to. Later in the prepared remarks, Julia will share our latest outlook on expenses and margin expansion for the year. Finally, I'd like to talk about our progress in making Pinterest more positive place on the Internet. Our commitment to fostering a more positive environment resonates with advertisers. We believe our relative brand safety remains a driver for advertisers to invest more and spend on Pinterest. Our efforts and positivity also resonate with users. For example, we're building inclusive AI technology like skin tone diversification that helps users personalize their experience and see themselves on Pinterest. In Q2, we improved the skin tone diversification of our core feeds, which led to engagement wins. We want others to join us on our mission to make the Internet a more positive place. In June, we created the inspired Internet pledge in collaboration with the Digital Wellness lab at Boston Children's Hospital. The pledge is the call to action for tech companies and the broader digital ecosystem to unite with the common goal of making the Internet a safer and healthier place for everyone, especially young people. Before turning the call over, I wanted to say a few words about our new CFO, Julia Donnelly, and why I'm so excited to partner with her going forward. We ran an extensive search for a CFO, and I know Julia is the right leader and partner to help our team grow and scale Pinterest. Prior to joining Julia was VP of Finance and Accounting at Wayfair, where she was responsible for the entire global finance and accounting organizations as well as Investor Relations and Corporate Development. She is a strategic, disciplined and highly regarded executive with an impressive background leading all aspects of finance within an innovative, high-growth public company. Her leadership and deep experience across e-commerce, media and technology will be invaluable as we position ourselves for the next chapter of entrust. I'll now turn the call over to Julie to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.\nJulia Donnelly: Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to join the Pinterest team. As you can imagine, it's been a busy and exciting few weeks since I joined in late June. First, I'd like to discuss a few of the reasons why I came to Pinterest and why I'm even more excited about the opportunity ahead. Before joining, I followed Pinterest extensively as a beloved brand with an inspiring and positive consumer app and a strong financial model. From my previous role, I've also watched Pinterest become an incredibly performant and innovative advertising platform. Coming from what I would consider a best-in-class e-commerce advertiser, I've had first-hand experience and how Pinterest is uniquely able to help marketers find users who are in the midst of an inspiration journey where they're looking to buy but not quite sure what they want and then ultimately take action to bring that to life. Over the last few weeks, sitting inside the company, I can attest to the excitement and energy from our teams on everything we are building for our users and advertisers. I'm honored to take on the CFO role and join the management team at Pinterest to continue building on this momentum. Leveraging my background in e-commerce, I look forward to helping us navigate through this exciting next chapter of growth, capturing the significant revenue potential ahead through strong operating execution and sound investments. Looking ahead, I'm excited to develop a productive dialogue with the shareholder and analyst community as well as sharing more about progress to date and future potential ahead at our Investor Day in September. Now turning to our results in the second quarter. In my remarks today, I'll discuss our Q2 financial performance and provide our preliminary outlook for Q3. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Bill mentioned, our investments in AI and new user experiences drove strong engagement on our platform in Q2, resulting in 465 million global monthly active users, an increase of over 30 million users over the last 12 months. We grew monthly active users 8% on a year-over-year basis globally, the highest growth we've seen during the last 2 years. In the U.S. and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, up 3%. In Europe, monthly active users were 124 million, up 6%. And in our Rest of World markets, monthly active users were 246 million, up 10%. Underlying our monthly active user metric, we had even faster growth and engagement as measured by sessions, impressions and SAFE [ph] which is a testament to the work we're doing around deepening engagement with our users. And I'm excited about the progress we're making with Gen Z users, which was our fastest-growing segment and an important and influential demographic for marketers in many of our core verticals. Turning to our financial performance. Global revenue for the second quarter came in at $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. and Canada revenue was $565 million, an increase of 4%. Europe revenue was $114 million, growing 12% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Revenue from Rest of World was $29 million, growing 32% or 35% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased to see global year-over-year revenue growth continued to strengthen this quarter versus Q1 '23 and Q4 '22. A testament that while the ad market remains somewhat choppy, advertisers continue to turn to turn to Pinterest because of our highly attractive user demographics, relative brand-safe environment and the strong return on ads spend we can deliver. During the quarter, at the top of the funnel, we saw strength and awareness objectives as many brand advertisers, particularly CPG advertisers, were able to meet their goals given our engagement gains and attractive pricing. Contributing to this growth were video ads and our new premier Spotlight takeover ad unit. At the bottom of the funnel this quarter, strength came from larger, more sophisticated advertisers who leaned into our shopping ads format driven by adoption of mobile deep-linking and our conversion API. However, we also experienced headwinds from those who have yet to adopt our measurement tools and pockets of distressed retail advertisers. Finally, across all parts of the funnel, we continue to gain good traction with advertisers in emerging verticals such as travel, autos and financial services, helping us further diversify our advertiser base outside of our traditional areas of strength. In terms of overall auction dynamics in the second quarter, ad supply grew more than 30%, driven by engagement gains and opening up supply to whole page optimization, and the price of ads declined 20% due primarily to a softer pricing environment across all geographies. Moving down the P&L. Cost of revenue was $164 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter versus Q1. This is the third quarter in a row of sequential declines in our cost of revenue line item as our teams implemented a number of efficiency projects across storage and compute infrastructure. It has been exciting to see how we can realize these efficiencies in our cost of revenue even while we drive significant engagement gains and ad stack innovation and leverage AI throughout our business. Overall, our non-GAAP operating expense was $440 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially versus Q1. This was below our guidance as we were able to drive more cost efficiencies, particularly in our R&D and G&A functions while also shifting some of our marketing spend from Q1 into Q2. Adjusted EBITDA had a very strong quarter, coming in at $107 million or a 15% margin, up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased revenue, efficiency in our cost of revenue and operating expense discipline. This quarter, we successfully completed our $500 million stock repurchase program, well ahead of the 12-month plan to complete the program as we saw openings to be opportunistic with our purchases during the quarter. We continue to be mindful of managing dilution. Capital allocation will be a topic of our - at our upcoming Investor Day, and we look forward to sharing more details at that time. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Now I'd like to provide preliminary financial guidance for the third quarter. While the overall digital ads market appears to be stabilizing, the recovery remains uneven with pockets of strength and weakness. We expect Q3 revenue to grow in the high single-digits range year-over-year. Based on what we are seeing right now, we expect to land towards the middle of that range, which would represent a moderate acceleration from the growth rate we saw in Q2. This includes a small impact from foreign exchange, which is reflected in our guide. Turning to expenses. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low single digits range year-over-year. Please note that our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. As we have noted previously, we are committed to expanding adjusted EBITDA margins in full year 2023 on the order of a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year in any state of the world. Based on the revenue acceleration and the expense outlook provided above, we believe the adjusted EBITDA we expect to deliver in Q3 puts us on the path to double that prior commitment, resulting in roughly 400 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for full year 2023. We feel good about the progress we've made on users, engagement and monetization while also maintaining cost discipline to ensure we are investing in areas with clear line of sight to strong returns to capture the sizable revenue potential we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill for a few final words.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Julia. I'm proud of our team's execution to deliver strong results in Q2. And I'm confident that we're making the appropriate investments to provide great experiences for our users and more value for advertisers. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: We will now open the line for questions. The first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I could. Bill, first for you. You talked a lot about product and platform iteration and there's also a lot of talk about the current advertising environment. Can you talk a little bit about when you think about the elements of revenue reacceleration that are building in your business, how much are elements that are within your control based on things you're building and sort of executing on inside the business versus elements of volatility down to the broader ad environment or macro environment that are somewhat out of your control. And then the second one, Julia first, congrats on the new role. I look forward to working with you going forward. I wanted to come back to your comments during your prepared remarks and just delve a little bit deeper in what you see as some of the big opportunities or agenda items that you want to tackle in this role as the CFO? Thanks so much.\nBill Ready: Thanks for the question, Eric. So to your first question, on what we can control and what's sort of in the broader environment. The broader environment is seeing some stabilization and some signs of recovery, but there's still a lot of puts and takes and a lot of choppiness out there. Direct example of that is if you look at pricing impact, which would be sort of a direct evidence of sort of softness in the ad market, that's down 20% year-on-year for us. That's pretty consistent with what you see across other large platforms, some of which have had year-on-year declines last year and year-on-year declines again this year, they were double digit plus or 15 percentage point plus. So you have this pretty strong pricing headwind, which is just the element of like softness in the broader market. And so while there is some signs of stabilization in pockets of recovery, there's still choppiness in that as evidenced by both us and other major platforms with that pretty material headwind on pricing. But if you look at - to your question of what we can control there, we feel fantastic about the progress that we're making. And the things in our control, most noteworthy, the return to user growth, we just put up our largest user growth quarter in 2-plus years deepening engagement on the platform. We've talked about how, given the high commerciality of what users do on our platform, that we can take ad load much higher than what it has been that ads in a commercial context can be really relevant content. And so we can take ad load higher even while driving deeper engagement, and you see that evidence in our results. That's a really unique thing in the ad world to be able to do that. And particularly in social media, where ads tend to sort of take the user away from what they're trying to do because they're more of an entertainment mode. Here, because we have the user in a lean forward intent mode, we are demonstrating through our whole page optimization work and our dynamic ad load that we've been able to take ad load up 30% - or drive 30%-plus lift in impressions, part of that driven by growth in user engagement, but a big part of that driven by increasing ad load while engagement is up meaning we're proving out those ads as relevant content. So I think that, coupled with the advertiser side of this, where as they're getting more adoption of our measurement tools, they continuously as they adopt our latest measurement tools, spend more and tend to be much faster growers than those on the rest of our platform. I've shared this in some prior remarks later in the quarter this past quarter that those that have adopted our measurement tools tend to grow on the order of 30% year-on-year. Those that have not yet adopted our mid-single-digit decline. So as we're driving that adoption curve, that headwind will increasingly flip around to tailwind for us. And so those are things that are in our control that again, if you step back from it, give us lots of confidence in where we're going. And I think it's why if you step all the way back and you look at us versus the broader ad market, we're one of the only major ad platforms that has grown consistently every quarter through the downturn in the ad market. and why we're seeing acceleration quarter-on-quarter. And while that acceleration is moderate, when you look at the 20 point-plus headwind on pricing and the fact that we're one of the only consistent growers through the downturn, I think that speaks to the really positive progress on the platform. And then final point, I'd just say a year ago, one of the big questions was would shopping work on the platform. We had user research to send more than half the year here to shop, the wood shopping work on the platform. And there, I think our results just could not be more encouraging. We talked about 50%-plus year-on-year improvement in engagement with shoppable content as we brought shoppable content on to our main surfaces. And that's accelerating quarter-on-quarter from 35% last quarter. So that as an indicator of the commerciality of our platform and what we can do for advertisers, I think, again, just gives us tremendous optimism. And while we can't predict when the sort of pricing headwinds in the broader ad market alleviate or turn back into a tailwind, we've been able to deliver really solid growth even with a 20-point plus headwind. And I'll give it to Julia for your second question.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks, Eric, for the question. I appreciate it. So first, let me start with just a couple of observations. It's been obviously an exciting few weeks here for me at Pinterest. And from my prior seat, I heard a lot about Pinterest and the exciting pace of innovation that was taking place. Now that I'm on the inside, it's great to see that many other advertisers are really recognizing the same. When I first got here, the teams had just gotten back from can. They were talking about the buzz and momentum from agencies and advertisers about all the ad products we're building. As we mentioned earlier, we've actually tripled the number of ad formats released so far this year versus last year, and we're really accelerating the pace of ad stack innovation meaningfully as we described earlier. So that's starting to really get recognized by the broader advertiser community, which is great to see. The second observation I'd have is just how impressed I've been early in here just the level of engineering and product talent that we have inside the company here, particularly in our AI functions. We have really world-class AI teams that have - Pinterest has been a talent magnet on that front. So I'm impressed to see and learn how embedded AI actually is in virtually every aspect of our platform today. And as you think about sort of agenda items and where we go from here, obviously, I'm very excited about the direction that this team already has taken a company and that's a big part of why I chose to join and help build on that momentum. I'd say we've made some real progress over the last year. But my - where I look forward to partnering with the team is continuing to make sure we're driving those investments in areas with really clear line of sight to returns where we're investing in that growth to capture the revenue opportunity but also doing so profitably and looking to drive that operating leverage over time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. So we're starting to see these really nice SKU-level ads from Amazon showing up in the app. And you just mentioned that you guys have been able to increase that load pretty nicely even before turning these on. So I guess, can you just talk about like how you think about ad load, the ceiling to ad load if there is one? And then how these new Amazon - compare from a pricing perspective to the directly sold interest ads? And then the second question is just on the new categories, the travel, financial services, auto, just how you guys are viewing? I know it's early, but how are you viewing those non-endemic categories in terms of potential opportunity in the next couple of years? Thanks a lot.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Ross. So on your point on the Amazon Ads partnership, as I've said before, we really believe that the commerciality on our platform can allow us to take ad load much higher. We don't break out ad loads specifically, but we've talked about the 30%-plus growth in monetizable supply, which is meaningfully faster than our engagement growth overall. That's really been driven by bringing more relevant shoppable content onto the platform for users. So Amazon as a partner, we're quite encouraged that they can bring more of that shoppable content plus a great buying experience for users. And so while it's a multi-quarter implementation and again, a reminder that the biggest element of that revenue we expect to start hitting in early '24, we're really pleased with the pace of implementation. And in those early results, if I explained a bit on those early results that we're so happy about one of the biggest things we're happy about is that we're seeing improvement and relevancy even beyond what we're already very optimistic expectations on our side. And so as we see that it's contributing to more relevant shopping content that further bolsters our view that we can take ad load much higher. And if you compared to other analogs that I've seen in past life and that you all could see as you sort of count ad load or add slots on other sort of shopping experiences. -- ad load provided we have the right relevancy, Adlocan [ph] be a multiple of what it is today for our users particularly when users are in commercial context and more than half the users are here to shop. So I think that says that there is still a lot more runway ahead, quite a high ceiling for where we can go with ad load. And the fact that we've already been growing at 30% plus year-on-year in terms of overall monetizable supply, while also increasing engagement is proving out that theory of the case that we can grow ad load while also making it relevant engagement driving content for our users. So we feel really good about all that. And then to your second question on new categories and how we're seeing those sort of previously non- categories, across Pinterestinc, we talked about the uniqueness of Pinterestinc being that it's a great full funnel platform where people would go from inspiration to action. But we knew that actionability was historically a weaker part of the platform as we've been bringing in more satisfaction of intent, more ability to go from intent to action, we're seeing that, that is resonating across categories, across verticals. And so a few that we mentioned, like travel, auto, men's fashion, we're seeing that as we're doing more to create satisfaction intent, that is applying well across other categories. Travel is probably the most noteworthy I mentioned in my prepared remarks, travel is quite a large ad market overall. People have always dreamed about travel on Pinterestinc. But again, like shopping, the actionability was lower as we've taken our work in shopping, applied a lot of that base technology to travel and opened up a travel catalog as we now have made more of those travel ads and clickable and engageable by the user with things like pricing information availability we're seeing that, that intent to action effort is driving really good results with users and with advertisers. So I think that's quite encouraging that while we still have tremendous runway to go in shopping, there are other meaningful categories and verticals on Pinterest. And so we're quite excited about that. Finally, I would just say on the organic side of that, I mentioned some of what we're doing around helping to nudge users into other use cases. I think this is one of the things we've seen historically is that Pinterest could at times be more episodic for some users, and we've been leveraging some of our AI capabilities and some of our product experiences to now nudge users towards other relevant categories for them. And we're finding that is working really well. So we think there's a lot more runway to go there.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open,\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thanks. A couple for me on the partner monetization side, if I can. First, it sounds like Amazon partnership is progressing faster than you guys expected. What are the big outstanding blocks you need to get through to scale that? And as you think about potentially adding other partners, like are those things that would need to get redone from scratch? Or is this more foundational platform efforts? And then second one, the partnership you guys announced with Alf [ph] how meaningful could that contribution ultimately grow to and in markets where you have their sales force helping you and other third parties, how will you kind of toggle between those sorts of go-to-market and a less? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Thanks for the question, Lloyd. So on the partnership with Amazon and sort of your broader comments on bringing on third-party demand, as we said, yes, we are very pleased with the pace of implementation and even more importantly, pleased with the significant improvement in relevancy and what that says about the long-term potential of that partnership. And so a couple of things I would note. You asked about the pace there, yes, we are pacing ahead of expectations. At the same time, as we get relevancy really right that places a much higher ceiling on the long-term potential of the partnership. So in the near term, we're making sure that even though we're really pleased with the pace and the progress and the results, then we want to make sure we do that in a methodical way, getting the relevancy really right for the user because as we do that, that gives us a much higher long-term ceiling. So we're not going to sort of sacrifice the long term to sort of go faster than is necessary in the short term, but we are seeing really positive progress there. And I'd say our long-term view of that partnership just continues to expand, even though we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of revenue contribution for this year. We do think that when you step back and say, our big opportunity here is about making our platform shoppable, in content to users. What we're seeing there is extraordinarily encouraging. I think the ceiling only continues to lift as you look at the long term there. And the pacing again is better than where we had expected. You had asked about other partners. We've mentioned this previously, we do expect to have multiple partners to help us bring in engaging relevant content, ad demand for our users. We're focused on making sure we get this first one really right. But we are building in a way that will help to sort of agree the skids for others. And so we do think as we land this one really well, and that's tracking well and we start to look towards other potential partners that we're building this in a way that is repeatable and will help us continue to accelerate as we think about where we go forward. But again, we're going to make sure we get this one really right, particularly getting that user relevancy right because we get that right, then the ability to go take that ad load up much higher while still deepening engagement with users is really the longer-term potential here. And again, all signals there are encouraging even beyond our prior expectations. You asked about what we're doing with LF [ph] and how meaningful that could be. So for that, as we think about international, we do think that our international monetization is a big opportunity for us. This past year, we had to really focus on making sure that we made some meaningful updates to our user experience and our ad capabilities in our largest markets, which are highly competitive, and so we feel good about the progress we've made on that. We did start to make some focused investment in international, particularly with agencies and partners that can help us drive more distribution and meeting our advertisers where they are. And so as we have leaned into agency deals and partners that can help us distribute internationally, we have seen those have performed quite well without speaking to any one specific partner, we've seen that those have been growing at a much faster rate of revenue than what we would see otherwise So we think there's a lot more yield in that. And as we look into '24, we think international that has probably been under monetized across the board, we have been even more under monetized internationally. And so I think we have some really encouraging proof points to say there's a lot more we can lend into international monetization as we go into '24, particularly with partners like olefin others that can help us accelerate that distribution. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. I want to ask about the two things: the LLM models, the impact you've seen in terms of cost per action, reduced cost per action and lift in CTRs, I would assume these are still kind of early stage results for you. Could you talk maybe about what kind of long-term impact you could see? Or is that kind of in the unknown knowns. How much better do you think the application of large language models to Pinterest much more of an improvement could you see on both the user and the advertiser side? And then one specific question about this data point you provided on a month ago about how 10% of your advertisers were -- had adopted your measurement tools, and they're growing 30% year-over-year in terms of their ad spend with you. Where are those two numbers now? And like what's a reasonable expectation for when 10% gets to 50%? Thank you very much.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Mark. Appreciate the questions. So on LLM models, two things are simultaneously true. O ne is we are seeing tremendous benefit, and we are pretty far along with what we're doing there. The second thing is true, though, is that as you look at the longer, I think there is a lot more runway to go in terms of what we can do with that core technology, particularly when you consider the fact that, that technology is going to continue advancing. So to be more specific, on larger models and next-gen AI capabilities moving from CPUs and GPUs, things like that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really started into that nearly a year ago. These things were available prior to sort of a lot of the sort of big uptick in sort of the news cycle around earlier this year. These things were available, and I worked close with them in past lives, knew the potential there, and it's something that we really started to lean into nearly a year ago. We started first on the organic side. And so as you look over the past several quarters, the fact that we've been able to take our recommender models up to be 100 times larger than what they were. I mentioned on the call that 10 percentage point improvement in perceived relevancy by the user. In the world of search, advertising, discovery, 10 percentage point improvements in relevancy are like completely unheard of, like the magnitude of that like cannot be overstated. So I think that says, okay, we're seeing really tremendous impact from that, and we're well on our way on that on the organic side. On the ad side, we just started bringing that over to the ad side now with models 100 times larger. So we got right on the organic side first. Now we're bringing it to the ad side. And yes, same thing on the ad side, when you look at those things like a 5% reduction in CPA and a 10% lift in click-through rates, again, in the world of advertising, those are unheard of kind of numbers. And so we're early on there, but the impacts were profound. So we're quite excited about how much more runway is left with those things. But we're deep enough in it to know that we feel like we are absolutely drafting on that acceleration in innovation that's happening in AI generally. It's been a core strength of Pinterest for a long time, computer vision as one of the places that has been sort of at the forefront of sort of advancements in AI and computer vision has been a strength for Pinterest, and we've got a really talented team there. So we feel really well positioned on continuing leverage from AI or further along on organic, but with a lot of runway to go on the ad side, we're earlier there, but already seeing profound impacts. So again, tons of runway on both. I think on your second question around the 10% of advertisers that had adopted measurement tools growing 30% on the range of 30%. We gave that update pretty deep into the quarter last quarter. So we're not updating those specific numbers at this moment. We're going to have our Investor Day coming up. We'll talk more about some of the progress there. The one thing I will say is that we've seen really nice continued adoption. The biggest thing I've been watching for is, as we continue along that adoption curve, do we continue to see the linkage between advertisers adopting the measurement tools and then seeing that they were getting much better performance than what they had realized from Pinterest and increasing spend. And that linkage, not only has that remained present as we've continued along that adoption curve, that linkage is becoming stronger. And maybe to give a little bit of a qualitative example of that when we were at can [ph] not that long ago and great gathering of many of the world's leading advertisers, we had tremendous buzz there on a number of fronts, just around the overall acceleration in our platform, our users and the acceleration of our ad platform. But this point of advertisers adopting and seeing that they were getting much more performance than what they had realized and there were much more performance oriented solutions available for them than what had been available for things like mobile deep link and things like that, that are driving great lower funnel performance. There was really good buzz around that. And there's nothing better than having a large sophisticated advertiser out there saying, \"Oh, yes, we adopted that from Pinterest and saw really great results. And I think I mentioned that in my prior commentary that as we look at those that have adopted so far or the early adopters actually tended to be the larger, more sophisticated advertisers, the hardest ones to please. So I said before, if you can make them happy, you can make anybody happy. And that's what we've been seeing is that as successive cohorts are adopting, that linkage is not only still present, but getting stronger in terms of them seeing more performance than they realize and therefore, increasing their spend with us.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is now open.\nRich Greenfield: Bill, you were talking about sort of the AI and targeting. And I guess there's just this growing fear among investors that everyone not named Meda [ph] Google, Apple will be sort of a little struggle to compete in AI as we look out over the next 2 years? And given the importance of AI bot as you were talking about from content recommendations and ad targeting, and I know sort of the history you spoke to at Pinterest in terms of computer vision. But would love to get a sense of how you think about how you compete with the - what is, I guess, the juggernaut in tech, especially given your background at Google. And then I just got a quick follow-up on demographics?\nBill Ready: All right. Maybe we get the follow-up quickly, just so we know what it is, and we don't lose it from you.\nRich Greenfield: The follow-up is just you talked about the demographic group, and you talked about Gen Z growing so quickly. As we look at all of the different demos that use Pinterest, especially as you think about shopping, the actual -- taking action on content and buying content, do you see any major deviations or changes in terms of what behavior looks at by demographic as you look by cohort? Anything to kind of call out in terms of what you're seeing on shopping activity specifically?\nBill Ready: Okay. Great. Thank you, Rich. So on your first question on AI, I think there's a question of do the benefits only accrue to the largest. I think we're already providing a pretty strong counterpoint to that. And actually, if you step back, I think if you look at like cloud computing, while yes, cloud computing had a lot of benefits to the largest providers of cloud computing, it also created a lot of ability for a broad swath of people to engage. And I think you're seeing that with AI that yes, you have some of the largest players that are providing a lot of great capabilities there, but they're also externalizing those through cloud compute. It's also the case that the open source community is advancing really rapidly, and you're seeing some of these open source models are actually comparing quite favorably to some of the things that you would have seen come from the very largest players. And if I step back for a moment, I would actually take the view that I think in this sort of first round of next-gen AI, I think you've seen a lot of value accrue to the model creators. As you play that forward, I actually think there's going to be a lot of value that starts to accrue to the places that have really unique signal and really unique user interactions. The AI is only as good as the signal of home, which is acting. And when you look at it through that lens, we have a really unique signal at Pinterest. We've talked about this that unlike the rest of social media, we have very high commercial intent. But if you go further in that, it's not just we have commercial intent, it's not just that we know what people might click on or buy. These commercial journeys are long-lived, and users on Pinterest interestingly, are curating for the future. So we don't just know what people have done in the past. We know what they're planning to do in the future . When you think of the power of that signal and what that can do in terms of the power of recommendations that we can make to users, the advertising capabilities that we can open up with that I think we just have a lot of uniqueness in our signal from the fact that it's not just the people who are shopping here, they are curating here. They are not just saying, okay, here's the pair of shoes I'm interested in the hand value that I'm interested in or the dress that I'm interested in, they're saying, here's how I think about putting a great outfit together. And this handbag and these shoes go with distress, and that's being repeated across hundreds of millions of users on our platform. That is a completely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else, certainly not in the Western world. And that really unique signal as we're pairing that with those models, I think that's letting us do really unique things with the way that we can make recommendations. So when I talk about that relevancy, a really interesting thing to think about for us it's not even just that a search relevancy, you're saying, \"Okay, you search for the sign we give you the right thing. We're doing that on things like related items. And so to get to things like 94% plus relevancy, when we're doing broader sort of discovery for the user, that is exceptionally difficult, but is an example of us taking the models that are becoming more generally available for all and then applying them to really unique signals and really unique user interactions on our platform. So I feel that we are quite well positioned in the longer term sort of move towards next-gen AI and the dynamics there, I think, are quite favorable for us. And again, I think no better way than to demonstrate that in your results, and we've been doing that. I think your second question on demographic groups. We've noted this multiple times that Gen Z is our fastest-growing demographic and our largest contributor to overall engagement, which means it's not just a high growth rate on a small denominator, it's our largest contributor to overall engagement growth. That's a really interesting thing I've worked on a lot of different consumer products and a lot of different platforms. Generally, as you get a more mature platform or a more mature product, each successive cohort is a little less engaged, a little weaker. To be able to say that we have Gen Z a more recent cohort that's actually engaging even more deeply than our prior cohorts, I think is quite exceptional. And I think it gets to the fact that what we're solving with this ability to go from dreaming to doing and to use pents as a way to play in your future, whether that's in travel or in shopping I think that's really resonating in a lot of our next-gen experiences that we're bringing are resonating there as well, things like what we've done with shuffles and the ability to go even more uniquely curate these things, that's working quite well. Shopping , you asked about that specifically. I think we're finding that to be broadly resonant. And so not only is the shopping behavior broadly resonant across demographics, I mentioned that, that shopping behavior or sort of if you step back and say, doing more inspiration to action, we're seeing that work across other verticals and categories. That's quite encouraging for us as well like the travel sampling we've spoken about. Operator we'll take our last question.\nOperator: Absolutely. The last question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Bill, I know you touched on Tapi [ph] I guess I just want to understand what's keeping advertisers from adopting here? And what are you doing proactively to move them along the adoption curve? And then secondly, any comments on the MAU decline in Europe in 2Q. I don't know if that was part of the birthday collection dynamic that you've talked about. And just curious if you have any thoughts on the overall 3Q MAU outlook? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Doug. I'll take your first one and then give Julie the second one. So our conversion API is important to hit. Our conversion API, we've only recently put that out there. It's been on the market less than a year. So we're early on with that. So to say what's keeping folks from adopting it, we're really pleased with the progress that we've been making on that. It's a recent product for us, and we've seen really significant uptake of that product. So we feel really good about it overall. But of course, we want to be faster, given the magnitude of its impact is so consequential for us and the advertiser. I think the spirit of your question of like, hey, how do we move along the adoption curve faster. We very much are mindful of that. So a few things that we're thinking about. The first is with that being a recently introduced product, we've really been getting our own go-to-market really tight in terms of how our sales team is engaging. The more we have proof points, I talked about having large sophisticated advertisers that are speaking about how impactful it's been for them. That - those reference points are really compelling that's really helping us drive better and better go-to-market with our first-party efforts there. But the other thing that we're doing is working to meet the advertisers where they are because there's a broad-based adoption curve on these things, it's not just us with the larger platforms are putting these things out there as well. And so advertisers are moving through an adoption curve on this. So we're making sure that we're working with third-party partners. We've mentioned some of them like LiveRamp and Tealium or Google Tag Manager and then certainly, our recent partnership with Amazon's ad platform, these are all examples of integrating to the platforms where those advertisers are already integrated. So that sort of multipronged approach of saying we're going to get better and better with our own go-to-market, which is working really well and advancing quite nicely as well as meeting the advertiser where they are. Those things are sort of the two-fronted approach of how we're accelerating that. And again, the most encouraging thing is that consistently as those advertisers adopt these measurement solutions, they're seeing better performance than they expected from us and increasing their spend with us. So we think that is right now, the balance of those advertisers given us a new product being tilted towards not yet having that tool while that creates some headwind for us. We talked about that cohort being a mid-single-digit decliner. But the ones that have adopted those tend to be growers on the order of 30%, that headwind flips around a tailwind as we get more of that balance of adoption. And we are seeing strong pull-through on that.\nJulia Donnelly: And then, Doug, just on your second question about lumpily active user kind of trends, specifically in Europe and globally and now look for Q3. I'd say, as Bill noted, we feel really great about the monthly active user growth that we've seen globally. So we're at a 2-year high, both globally and in the U.S. and in rest of world and near-tear high in Europe as well, if you look at year-over-year. Comps on MAUs. So I think we're feeling really good there. There is some seasonality in the business on monthly active users as we called out on our prior earnings call. This is Q2 is a 30-day look back and during the month of June. And so you do typically see a little bit more seasonal weakness in Q2 and then that reverts back in Q3. So it's important to really focus on year-over-year metrics looking here. And on that basis, we're continuing to feel quite strong. Birthday collection was something we noted on the prior call that ended up being a nonfactor and not material. So overall, feeling very good about all the trends that we're seeing on MAUs, the return on our marketing spend and all the user and growth engagements that we're investing in. And I would expect that we don't guide on MAUs for Q3 specifically. But in general, we feel really good about being able to maintain those year-over-year increases going forward.\nNeil Doshi: All right. Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going, and hope you all enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines. +",

            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to join the Pinterest team. As you can imagine, it's been a busy and exciting few weeks since I joined in late June. First, I'd like to discuss a few of the reasons why I came to Pinterest and why I'm even more excited about the opportunity ahead. Before joining, I followed Pinterest extensively as a beloved brand with an inspiring and positive consumer app and a strong financial model. From my previous role, I've also watched Pinterest become an incredibly performant and innovative advertising platform. Coming from what I would consider a best-in-class e-commerce advertiser, I've had first-hand experience and how Pinterest is uniquely able to help marketers find users who are in the midst of an inspiration journey where they're looking to buy but not quite sure what they want and then ultimately take action to bring that to life. Over the last few weeks, sitting inside the company, I can attest to the excitement and energy from our teams on everything we are building for our users and advertisers. I'm honored to take on the CFO role and join the management team at Pinterest to continue building on this momentum. Leveraging my background in e-commerce, I look forward to helping us navigate through this exciting next chapter of growth, capturing the significant revenue potential ahead through strong operating execution and sound investments. Looking ahead, I'm excited to develop a productive dialogue with the shareholder and analyst community as well as sharing more about progress to date and future potential ahead at our Investor Day in September. Now turning to our results in the second quarter. In my remarks today, I'll discuss our Q2 financial performance and provide our preliminary outlook for Q3. All financial metrics, except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Bill mentioned, our investments in AI and new user experiences drove strong engagement on our platform in Q2, resulting in 465 million global monthly active users, an increase of over 30 million users over the last 12 months. We grew monthly active users 8% on a year-over-year basis globally, the highest growth we've seen during the last 2 years. In the U.S. and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, up 3%. In Europe, monthly active users were 124 million, up 6%. And in our Rest of World markets, monthly active users were 246 million, up 10%. Underlying our monthly active user metric, we had even faster growth and engagement as measured by sessions, impressions and SAFE [ph] which is a testament to the work we're doing around deepening engagement with our users. And I'm excited about the progress we're making with Gen Z users, which was our fastest-growing segment and an important and influential demographic for marketers in many of our core verticals. Turning to our financial performance. Global revenue for the second quarter came in at $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. and Canada revenue was $565 million, an increase of 4%. Europe revenue was $114 million, growing 12% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Revenue from Rest of World was $29 million, growing 32% or 35% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased to see global year-over-year revenue growth continued to strengthen this quarter versus Q1 '23 and Q4 '22. A testament that while the ad market remains somewhat choppy, advertisers continue to turn to turn to Pinterest because of our highly attractive user demographics, relative brand-safe environment and the strong return on ads spend we can deliver. During the quarter, at the top of the funnel, we saw strength and awareness objectives as many brand advertisers, particularly CPG advertisers, were able to meet their goals given our engagement gains and attractive pricing. Contributing to this growth were video ads and our new premier Spotlight takeover ad unit. At the bottom of the funnel this quarter, strength came from larger, more sophisticated advertisers who leaned into our shopping ads format driven by adoption of mobile deep-linking and our conversion API. However, we also experienced headwinds from those who have yet to adopt our measurement tools and pockets of distressed retail advertisers. Finally, across all parts of the funnel, we continue to gain good traction with advertisers in emerging verticals such as travel, autos and financial services, helping us further diversify our advertiser base outside of our traditional areas of strength. In terms of overall auction dynamics in the second quarter, ad supply grew more than 30%, driven by engagement gains and opening up supply to whole page optimization, and the price of ads declined 20% due primarily to a softer pricing environment across all geographies. Moving down the P&L. Cost of revenue was $164 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter versus Q1. This is the third quarter in a row of sequential declines in our cost of revenue line item as our teams implemented a number of efficiency projects across storage and compute infrastructure. It has been exciting to see how we can realize these efficiencies in our cost of revenue even while we drive significant engagement gains and ad stack innovation and leverage AI throughout our business. Overall, our non-GAAP operating expense was $440 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially versus Q1. This was below our guidance as we were able to drive more cost efficiencies, particularly in our R&D and G&A functions while also shifting some of our marketing spend from Q1 into Q2. Adjusted EBITDA had a very strong quarter, coming in at $107 million or a 15% margin, up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased revenue, efficiency in our cost of revenue and operating expense discipline. This quarter, we successfully completed our $500 million stock repurchase program, well ahead of the 12-month plan to complete the program as we saw openings to be opportunistic with our purchases during the quarter. We continue to be mindful of managing dilution. Capital allocation will be a topic of our - at our upcoming Investor Day, and we look forward to sharing more details at that time. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Now I'd like to provide preliminary financial guidance for the third quarter. While the overall digital ads market appears to be stabilizing, the recovery remains uneven with pockets of strength and weakness. We expect Q3 revenue to grow in the high single-digits range year-over-year. Based on what we are seeing right now, we expect to land towards the middle of that range, which would represent a moderate acceleration from the growth rate we saw in Q2. This includes a small impact from foreign exchange, which is reflected in our guide. Turning to expenses. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low single digits range year-over-year. Please note that our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. As we have noted previously, we are committed to expanding adjusted EBITDA margins in full year 2023 on the order of a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year in any state of the world. Based on the revenue acceleration and the expense outlook provided above, we believe the adjusted EBITDA we expect to deliver in Q3 puts us on the path to double that prior commitment, resulting in roughly 400 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for full year 2023. We feel good about the progress we've made on users, engagement and monetization while also maintaining cost discipline to ensure we are investing in areas with clear line of sight to strong returns to capture the sizable revenue potential we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill for a few final words. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I appreciate it. So first, let me start with just a couple of observations. It's been obviously an exciting few weeks here for me at Pinterest. And from my prior seat, I heard a lot about Pinterest and the exciting pace of innovation that was taking place. Now that I'm on the inside, it's great to see that many other advertisers are really recognizing the same. When I first got here, the teams had just gotten back from can. They were talking about the buzz and momentum from agencies and advertisers about all the ad products we're building. As we mentioned earlier, we've actually tripled the number of ad formats released so far this year versus last year, and we're really accelerating the pace of ad stack innovation meaningfully as we described earlier. So that's starting to really get recognized by the broader advertiser community, which is great to see. The second observation I'd have is just how impressed I've been early in here just the level of engineering and product talent that we have inside the company here, particularly in our AI functions. We have really world-class AI teams that have - Pinterest has been a talent magnet on that front. So I'm impressed to see and learn how embedded AI actually is in virtually every aspect of our platform today. And as you think about sort of agenda items and where we go from here, obviously, I'm very excited about the direction that this team already has taken a company and that's a big part of why I chose to join and help build on that momentum. I'd say we've made some real progress over the last year. But my - where I look forward to partnering with the team is continuing to make sure we're driving those investments in areas with really clear line of sight to returns where we're investing in that growth to capture the revenue opportunity but also doing so profitably and looking to drive that operating leverage over time. And then, Doug, just on your second question about lumpily active user kind of trends, specifically in Europe and globally and now look for Q3. I'd say, as Bill noted, we feel really great about the monthly active user growth that we've seen globally. So we're at a 2-year high, both globally and in the U.S. and in rest of world and near-tear high in Europe as well, if you look at year-over-year. Comps on MAUs. So I think we're feeling really good there. There is some seasonality in the business on monthly active users as we called out on our prior earnings call. This is Q2 is a 30-day look back and during the month of June. And so you do typically see a little bit more seasonal weakness in Q2 and then that reverts back in Q3. So it's important to really focus on year-over-year metrics looking here. And on that basis, we're continuing to feel quite strong. Birthday collection was something we noted on the prior call that ended up being a nonfactor and not material. So overall, feeling very good about all the trends that we're seeing on MAUs, the return on our marketing spend and all the user and growth engagements that we're investing in. And I would expect that we don't guide on MAUs for Q3 specifically. But in general, we feel really good about being able to maintain those year-over-year increases going forward."

            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Q2 was a solid quarter marked by strong growth across our business. We're seeing ongoing momentum, giving us continued confidence that our strategy is yielding results with more potential as we look ahead. We ended the quarter with 465 million MAUs, up 8%. Our total revenue was $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We stay disciplined with our expenses and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $107 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. Before we dive into the key highlights from Q2, I'd like to share more about what we've accomplished over the last year since I joined and why I'm excited for the opportunities ahead. During this time, we've become laser-focused on our strategy of building upon our core differentiators and visual discovery to help our users go from inspiration to action. With that focus on our strategic priorities, we've successfully returned to strong user and engagement growth while delivering consistent year-on-year revenue growth and returning to margin expansion despite the downturn in the advertising environment. On the engagement side, we've utilized next-generation AI technologies to service more relevant and personalized content and improve ad relevance, driven more intent to action and focused our content strategy to bring actionable content from a range of sources, including users, creators, publishers and retailers. As a result, monthly active users have grown more than 30 million over the last 12 months. Our users are also coming back more frequently and are engaging more deeply. Engagement metrics such as sessions, impressions and saves grew substantially faster than our users across all of our regions over the same period. It's worth noting that we have seen these engagement gains over the past year during a period where we have also grown our ad load on the platform, proving that relevant ads, including lower funnel ad formats can be good content for users in a unique setting like ours with high commercial intent. We continue to see significant benefits and momentum from whole page optimization and ongoing improvements to our ads quality, targeting and relevancy. We increased our focus on making Pinterest more shoppable by integrating shopping into the core experiences of our platform. We're now seeing strong growth and engagement with shopping related content on our core surfaces. And for the past four quarters, shopping ads revenue has grown multiples of our total revenue growth. I believe we are just scratching the surface when it comes to monetizing lower funnel behavior on Pinterest. Importantly, we also accelerated innovation on behalf of our advertisers, tripling the number of ad product formats released so far this year versus last and introducing important measurement solutions that prove our value to advertisers. We are seeing revenue from advertisers who take advantage of these measurement tools to grow significantly faster, a positive sign for the future as we increase adoption of these tools among our customer base. We also opened our platform to third-party demand partners, starting with Amazon Ads platform. To summarize, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished over the last year, and we're just getting started. We look forward to sharing more details and a comprehensive update on our strategy during our Investor Day, taking place in San Francisco on September 19. With that backdrop, I'll now move on to the progress we've made in the second quarter, advancing our strategic priorities and driving the business forward. First, I'd like to discuss how we are deepening engagement with our existing users and growing new users in Q2, driven by our AI efforts in relevance and personalization as well as a clear focus on satisfaction of user intent. In Q2, our global MAUs grew 8%, while our mobile app MAUs, which account for over 80% of our revenue and impressions grew 16%. In addition, our U-Can mobile app MAUs grew 9%, accelerating from Q1. Our users were also visiting us more frequently. The basket of metrics that we use to measure engagement, such as sessions, impressions and saves grew significantly faster than MAUs in Q2 in all regions, consistent with the trends we have observed the last four quarters. To help bring this to life, I'd like to share a few examples of how we are driving engagement on the platform, starting with how we are implementing AI to better serve our users. Nearly a year ago, we began moving to next-gen AI capabilities, enabling us to use recommender models that were 100 times larger than before. We combined our first-party proprietary data with our AI-based computer vision and search technologies to improve the perceived relevance for recommendations on related pens, driving proceed relevance up by nearly 10 points from a year ago to 94%. This means that when users are searching for something on Pinterest, we are returning results that they find relevant and helpful and we're doing this with a very high degree of accuracy. More recently, as we have continued to focus on what our users really want from us, we've incorporated into our AI models more signals from our platform. As an example, in the first half of this year, we unlocked further engagement gains by incorporating propensity to share into our AI recommender models. By recommending content that users are more likely to share, we improved retention of our core users, and we grew revisits from dormant users as they are more likely to engage with recommended content from people they know. In Q2, another source of engagement gains came from the launch of our new guided browsing experience designed to help episodic users rediscover existing use cases and find their next project or passion on Pinterest. This experience adds a set of horizontal images across the home feeds grid where we can show more content based on the user's intent. The valuable signals we get from this new browsing module helps optimize the user experience for previous or new use cases and deliver more relevant shopping experiences We've seen a meaningful lift in revisitation as a result. As we continue to focus on improving the inspiration to action journey for users across our platform, we're seeing users explore more interest outside of our core home, food, fashion and beauty verticals, with strong growth in the number of MAUs engaging with emerging verticals such as men's fashion, auto, health and travel in the first half of this year. Lastly, we continue to see strong growth with Gen Z users on Pinterest who in Q2 were our largest contributor to overall engagement growth and the fastest growing cohort growing double digits and accounting for a larger portion of our overall mix. In particular, we found that our Gen Z users consistently engage more deeply on the platform than our older cohorts as measured by their saves and close up activity on the platform. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full funnel platform. These ad offerings allow us to reach a broader set of advertisers to diversify and grow our revenue base and also help us deliver improved results to our advertisers based on their performance criteria. First, let's start with how we are innovating at the lower end of the funnel, where we are helping retailers gain customers, not just transactions. In July, we brought our mobile deep linking product or MDL to general availability, opening up this highly performant offering to more advertisers. MDL is a great fit for retailers who want to drive users to purchase an item on their mobile app and has been a significant driver of our shopping ads revenue growth over the past 9 months. By taking what we've learned through MDL, we are planning to expand our lower funnel offerings to include more seamless one-click site handoffs in the back half of this year. This gives retailers who don't have a stand-alone app or prefer to do a one-click hand off directly to their site, the flexibility to choose what works best for their objectives. Travel catalogs are another format we debuted in the quarter, allowing advertisers to reach users who are in the midst of planning, organizing and taking action on their travel dreams. It's built on our product catalog technology and automatically turns each listing into a dynamic product pen with relevant booking information such as hotel name, pricing, images and descriptions. As an example, TUI, one of the world's leading tourism groups based in Germany added travel catalogs to their full funnel strategy to drive more users to their available hotel listings. In Q2, their campaign yielded strong results with a 6 times higher outbound click-through rate and an 80% lower outbound cost per click than they were seeing in previous conversion campaigns. Furthermore, we made good headway with helping advertisers measure the efficacy of their campaigns on Pinterest. Since introducing our conversion API in Q4, we've steadily grown the percentage of revenue from advertisers who adopted our conversion API solution. In addition to innovating on the lower funnel, we've also continued to innovate on upper funnel ad formats to build on our strength in that segment of the market and meet advertiser demand. In June, we made our Premier Spotlight ad format, which is our upper funnel takeover video ad unit on our search surface available for all advertisers. We're seeing early adoption from a large number of brand advertisers such as MAX, formerly known as HBOMax and Comcast XFINITY. Similar to last quarter, in Q2, we continued to drive a more than 30% increase in our global ad impressions or monetizable supply due to engagement gains and dynamically flexing ad load when a user is expressing intent through whole page optimization. We are also leveraging next-gen AI on our ad products, and we're seeing a profound impact in our ad capabilities. In Q2, we expanded our use of GPU serving from core engagement AI models to our ad delivery models, which enabled us to use models that are 100 times larger than before in ads as well as organic. The cumulative impact was a 5% reduction in cost per action and over 10% lift in click-through rates. I'm very proud of our team's execution on the monetization side, but we are still early in our ad platform evolution. I believe third-party partnerships can be additive by expanding the depth of advertisers bringing more relevant ads and improving our auction density. We announced our first third-party partnership with Amazon Ads in April. This partnership has strong synergies as Pinterest has significant commercial intent and consumer desire to go from inspiration to action while Amazon ads can bring more shoppable content with a great consumer buying experience. As I said on our last call, a partnership of this scale will be a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue impact likely being in early 2024. However, we have recently begun testing live traffic with Amazon ads. We are very pleased with the pace of implementation in Q2 and the early results of our testing in Q3 so far. Looking at our overall progress on shopping, we're quite excited at the momentum we're generating. We're building a powerful flywheel that is driving increased engagement among our users and delivering greater value to our advertisers. We're utilizing next-gen AI models with our first-party signal to recommend brands and products that are aligned with user preferences, and this is resonating with users. In Q1, we continued to grow the overall distribution of shopable 10 [ph] or products you can take action on, on the home feed. And in Q2, we've expanded this to all of our core surfaces. Users are actively engaging with this content with click-through rates and saves of shoppable 10 growing over 50%, accelerating from the 35% we saw in Q1. In Q2, we also launched a new automated shop-to-look module for home decor and fashion pens that utilizes AI to recommend similar shoppable products tied to our merchant catalogs. In our early A/B tests, Shop the - look is unlocking greater value for merchants as this high-intent traffic drove a 9% increase in conversions. And these innovations continue to manifest in robust shopping ads revenue, which continue to grow at a pace meaningfully faster than our overall revenue rate. Now I'd like to discuss our focus on operational rigor. As we've said in the past, we're instilling a culture where we are more focused on what drives results for users and advertisers and being more rigorous with our expenses, ultimately making us a more durable company. We've been able to accelerate our pace of innovation while also being disciplined on expense management, resulting in positive outcomes for our users, advertisers and shareholders. In Q1, we took steps to reduce our expenses and drive greater efficiencies in our business, including rightsizing our workforce to align talent to our strategic priorities and restructuring our real estate portfolio. In Q2, we identified further cost efficiencies, leading to operating expenses that were lower than we guided to. Later in the prepared remarks, Julia will share our latest outlook on expenses and margin expansion for the year. Finally, I'd like to talk about our progress in making Pinterest more positive place on the Internet. Our commitment to fostering a more positive environment resonates with advertisers. We believe our relative brand safety remains a driver for advertisers to invest more and spend on Pinterest. Our efforts and positivity also resonate with users. For example, we're building inclusive AI technology like skin tone diversification that helps users personalize their experience and see themselves on Pinterest. In Q2, we improved the skin tone diversification of our core feeds, which led to engagement wins. We want others to join us on our mission to make the Internet a more positive place. In June, we created the inspired Internet pledge in collaboration with the Digital Wellness lab at Boston Children's Hospital. The pledge is the call to action for tech companies and the broader digital ecosystem to unite with the common goal of making the Internet a safer and healthier place for everyone, especially young people. Before turning the call over, I wanted to say a few words about our new CFO, Julia Donnelly, and why I'm so excited to partner with her going forward. We ran an extensive search for a CFO, and I know Julia is the right leader and partner to help our team grow and scale Pinterest. Prior to joining Julia was VP of Finance and Accounting at Wayfair, where she was responsible for the entire global finance and accounting organizations as well as Investor Relations and Corporate Development. She is a strategic, disciplined and highly regarded executive with an impressive background leading all aspects of finance within an innovative, high-growth public company. Her leadership and deep experience across e-commerce, media and technology will be invaluable as we position ourselves for the next chapter of entrust. I'll now turn the call over to Julie to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Julia. I'm proud of our team's execution to deliver strong results in Q2. And I'm confident that we're making the appropriate investments to provide great experiences for our users and more value for advertisers. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Thanks for the question, Eric. So to your first question, on what we can control and what's sort of in the broader environment. The broader environment is seeing some stabilization and some signs of recovery, but there's still a lot of puts and takes and a lot of choppiness out there. Direct example of that is if you look at pricing impact, which would be sort of a direct evidence of sort of softness in the ad market, that's down 20% year-on-year for us. That's pretty consistent with what you see across other large platforms, some of which have had year-on-year declines last year and year-on-year declines again this year, they were double digit plus or 15 percentage point plus. So you have this pretty strong pricing headwind, which is just the element of like softness in the broader market. And so while there is some signs of stabilization in pockets of recovery, there's still choppiness in that as evidenced by both us and other major platforms with that pretty material headwind on pricing. But if you look at - to your question of what we can control there, we feel fantastic about the progress that we're making. And the things in our control, most noteworthy, the return to user growth, we just put up our largest user growth quarter in 2-plus years deepening engagement on the platform. We've talked about how, given the high commerciality of what users do on our platform, that we can take ad load much higher than what it has been that ads in a commercial context can be really relevant content. And so we can take ad load higher even while driving deeper engagement, and you see that evidence in our results. That's a really unique thing in the ad world to be able to do that. And particularly in social media, where ads tend to sort of take the user away from what they're trying to do because they're more of an entertainment mode. Here, because we have the user in a lean forward intent mode, we are demonstrating through our whole page optimization work and our dynamic ad load that we've been able to take ad load up 30% - or drive 30%-plus lift in impressions, part of that driven by growth in user engagement, but a big part of that driven by increasing ad load while engagement is up meaning we're proving out those ads as relevant content. So I think that, coupled with the advertiser side of this, where as they're getting more adoption of our measurement tools, they continuously as they adopt our latest measurement tools, spend more and tend to be much faster growers than those on the rest of our platform. I've shared this in some prior remarks later in the quarter this past quarter that those that have adopted our measurement tools tend to grow on the order of 30% year-on-year. Those that have not yet adopted our mid-single-digit decline. So as we're driving that adoption curve, that headwind will increasingly flip around to tailwind for us. And so those are things that are in our control that again, if you step back from it, give us lots of confidence in where we're going. And I think it's why if you step all the way back and you look at us versus the broader ad market, we're one of the only major ad platforms that has grown consistently every quarter through the downturn in the ad market. and why we're seeing acceleration quarter-on-quarter. And while that acceleration is moderate, when you look at the 20 point-plus headwind on pricing and the fact that we're one of the only consistent growers through the downturn, I think that speaks to the really positive progress on the platform. And then final point, I'd just say a year ago, one of the big questions was would shopping work on the platform. We had user research to send more than half the year here to shop, the wood shopping work on the platform. And there, I think our results just could not be more encouraging. We talked about 50%-plus year-on-year improvement in engagement with shoppable content as we brought shoppable content on to our main surfaces. And that's accelerating quarter-on-quarter from 35% last quarter. So that as an indicator of the commerciality of our platform and what we can do for advertisers, I think, again, just gives us tremendous optimism. And while we can't predict when the sort of pricing headwinds in the broader ad market alleviate or turn back into a tailwind, we've been able to deliver really solid growth even with a 20-point plus headwind. And I'll give it to Julia for your second question. Thanks, Ross. So on your point on the Amazon Ads partnership, as I've said before, we really believe that the commerciality on our platform can allow us to take ad load much higher. We don't break out ad loads specifically, but we've talked about the 30%-plus growth in monetizable supply, which is meaningfully faster than our engagement growth overall. That's really been driven by bringing more relevant shoppable content onto the platform for users. So Amazon as a partner, we're quite encouraged that they can bring more of that shoppable content plus a great buying experience for users. And so while it's a multi-quarter implementation and again, a reminder that the biggest element of that revenue we expect to start hitting in early '24, we're really pleased with the pace of implementation. And in those early results, if I explained a bit on those early results that we're so happy about one of the biggest things we're happy about is that we're seeing improvement and relevancy even beyond what we're already very optimistic expectations on our side. And so as we see that it's contributing to more relevant shopping content that further bolsters our view that we can take ad load much higher. And if you compared to other analogs that I've seen in past life and that you all could see as you sort of count ad load or add slots on other sort of shopping experiences. -- ad load provided we have the right relevancy, Adlocan [ph] be a multiple of what it is today for our users particularly when users are in commercial context and more than half the users are here to shop. So I think that says that there is still a lot more runway ahead, quite a high ceiling for where we can go with ad load. And the fact that we've already been growing at 30% plus year-on-year in terms of overall monetizable supply, while also increasing engagement is proving out that theory of the case that we can grow ad load while also making it relevant engagement driving content for our users. So we feel really good about all that. And then to your second question on new categories and how we're seeing those sort of previously non- categories, across Pinterestinc, we talked about the uniqueness of Pinterestinc being that it's a great full funnel platform where people would go from inspiration to action. But we knew that actionability was historically a weaker part of the platform as we've been bringing in more satisfaction of intent, more ability to go from intent to action, we're seeing that, that is resonating across categories, across verticals. And so a few that we mentioned, like travel, auto, men's fashion, we're seeing that as we're doing more to create satisfaction intent, that is applying well across other categories. Travel is probably the most noteworthy I mentioned in my prepared remarks, travel is quite a large ad market overall. People have always dreamed about travel on Pinterestinc. But again, like shopping, the actionability was lower as we've taken our work in shopping, applied a lot of that base technology to travel and opened up a travel catalog as we now have made more of those travel ads and clickable and engageable by the user with things like pricing information availability we're seeing that, that intent to action effort is driving really good results with users and with advertisers. So I think that's quite encouraging that while we still have tremendous runway to go in shopping, there are other meaningful categories and verticals on Pinterest. And so we're quite excited about that. Finally, I would just say on the organic side of that, I mentioned some of what we're doing around helping to nudge users into other use cases. I think this is one of the things we've seen historically is that Pinterest could at times be more episodic for some users, and we've been leveraging some of our AI capabilities and some of our product experiences to now nudge users towards other relevant categories for them. And we're finding that is working really well. So we think there's a lot more runway to go there. Thanks for the question, Lloyd. So on the partnership with Amazon and sort of your broader comments on bringing on third-party demand, as we said, yes, we are very pleased with the pace of implementation and even more importantly, pleased with the significant improvement in relevancy and what that says about the long-term potential of that partnership. And so a couple of things I would note. You asked about the pace there, yes, we are pacing ahead of expectations. At the same time, as we get relevancy really right that places a much higher ceiling on the long-term potential of the partnership. So in the near term, we're making sure that even though we're really pleased with the pace and the progress and the results, then we want to make sure we do that in a methodical way, getting the relevancy really right for the user because as we do that, that gives us a much higher long-term ceiling. So we're not going to sort of sacrifice the long term to sort of go faster than is necessary in the short term, but we are seeing really positive progress there. And I'd say our long-term view of that partnership just continues to expand, even though we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of revenue contribution for this year. We do think that when you step back and say, our big opportunity here is about making our platform shoppable, in content to users. What we're seeing there is extraordinarily encouraging. I think the ceiling only continues to lift as you look at the long term there. And the pacing again is better than where we had expected. You had asked about other partners. We've mentioned this previously, we do expect to have multiple partners to help us bring in engaging relevant content, ad demand for our users. We're focused on making sure we get this first one really right. But we are building in a way that will help to sort of agree the skids for others. And so we do think as we land this one really well, and that's tracking well and we start to look towards other potential partners that we're building this in a way that is repeatable and will help us continue to accelerate as we think about where we go forward. But again, we're going to make sure we get this one really right, particularly getting that user relevancy right because we get that right, then the ability to go take that ad load up much higher while still deepening engagement with users is really the longer-term potential here. And again, all signals there are encouraging even beyond our prior expectations. You asked about what we're doing with LF [ph] and how meaningful that could be. So for that, as we think about international, we do think that our international monetization is a big opportunity for us. This past year, we had to really focus on making sure that we made some meaningful updates to our user experience and our ad capabilities in our largest markets, which are highly competitive, and so we feel good about the progress we've made on that. We did start to make some focused investment in international, particularly with agencies and partners that can help us drive more distribution and meeting our advertisers where they are. And so as we have leaned into agency deals and partners that can help us distribute internationally, we have seen those have performed quite well without speaking to any one specific partner, we've seen that those have been growing at a much faster rate of revenue than what we would see otherwise So we think there's a lot more yield in that. And as we look into '24, we think international that has probably been under monetized across the board, we have been even more under monetized internationally. And so I think we have some really encouraging proof points to say there's a lot more we can lend into international monetization as we go into '24, particularly with partners like olefin others that can help us accelerate that distribution. Operator, next question. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate the questions. So on LLM models, two things are simultaneously true. O ne is we are seeing tremendous benefit, and we are pretty far along with what we're doing there. The second thing is true, though, is that as you look at the longer, I think there is a lot more runway to go in terms of what we can do with that core technology, particularly when you consider the fact that, that technology is going to continue advancing. So to be more specific, on larger models and next-gen AI capabilities moving from CPUs and GPUs, things like that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really started into that nearly a year ago. These things were available prior to sort of a lot of the sort of big uptick in sort of the news cycle around earlier this year. These things were available, and I worked close with them in past lives, knew the potential there, and it's something that we really started to lean into nearly a year ago. We started first on the organic side. And so as you look over the past several quarters, the fact that we've been able to take our recommender models up to be 100 times larger than what they were. I mentioned on the call that 10 percentage point improvement in perceived relevancy by the user. In the world of search, advertising, discovery, 10 percentage point improvements in relevancy are like completely unheard of, like the magnitude of that like cannot be overstated. So I think that says, okay, we're seeing really tremendous impact from that, and we're well on our way on that on the organic side. On the ad side, we just started bringing that over to the ad side now with models 100 times larger. So we got right on the organic side first. Now we're bringing it to the ad side. And yes, same thing on the ad side, when you look at those things like a 5% reduction in CPA and a 10% lift in click-through rates, again, in the world of advertising, those are unheard of kind of numbers. And so we're early on there, but the impacts were profound. So we're quite excited about how much more runway is left with those things. But we're deep enough in it to know that we feel like we are absolutely drafting on that acceleration in innovation that's happening in AI generally. It's been a core strength of Pinterest for a long time, computer vision as one of the places that has been sort of at the forefront of sort of advancements in AI and computer vision has been a strength for Pinterest, and we've got a really talented team there. So we feel really well positioned on continuing leverage from AI or further along on organic, but with a lot of runway to go on the ad side, we're earlier there, but already seeing profound impacts. So again, tons of runway on both. I think on your second question around the 10% of advertisers that had adopted measurement tools growing 30% on the range of 30%. We gave that update pretty deep into the quarter last quarter. So we're not updating those specific numbers at this moment. We're going to have our Investor Day coming up. We'll talk more about some of the progress there. The one thing I will say is that we've seen really nice continued adoption. The biggest thing I've been watching for is, as we continue along that adoption curve, do we continue to see the linkage between advertisers adopting the measurement tools and then seeing that they were getting much better performance than what they had realized from Pinterest and increasing spend. And that linkage, not only has that remained present as we've continued along that adoption curve, that linkage is becoming stronger. And maybe to give a little bit of a qualitative example of that when we were at can [ph] not that long ago and great gathering of many of the world's leading advertisers, we had tremendous buzz there on a number of fronts, just around the overall acceleration in our platform, our users and the acceleration of our ad platform. But this point of advertisers adopting and seeing that they were getting much more performance than what they had realized and there were much more performance oriented solutions available for them than what had been available for things like mobile deep link and things like that, that are driving great lower funnel performance. There was really good buzz around that. And there's nothing better than having a large sophisticated advertiser out there saying, \"Oh, yes, we adopted that from Pinterest and saw really great results. And I think I mentioned that in my prior commentary that as we look at those that have adopted so far or the early adopters actually tended to be the larger, more sophisticated advertisers, the hardest ones to please. So I said before, if you can make them happy, you can make anybody happy. And that's what we've been seeing is that as successive cohorts are adopting, that linkage is not only still present, but getting stronger in terms of them seeing more performance than they realize and therefore, increasing their spend with us. All right. Maybe we get the follow-up quickly, just so we know what it is, and we don't lose it from you. Okay. Great. Thank you, Rich. So on your first question on AI, I think there's a question of do the benefits only accrue to the largest. I think we're already providing a pretty strong counterpoint to that. And actually, if you step back, I think if you look at like cloud computing, while yes, cloud computing had a lot of benefits to the largest providers of cloud computing, it also created a lot of ability for a broad swath of people to engage. And I think you're seeing that with AI that yes, you have some of the largest players that are providing a lot of great capabilities there, but they're also externalizing those through cloud compute. It's also the case that the open source community is advancing really rapidly, and you're seeing some of these open source models are actually comparing quite favorably to some of the things that you would have seen come from the very largest players. And if I step back for a moment, I would actually take the view that I think in this sort of first round of next-gen AI, I think you've seen a lot of value accrue to the model creators. As you play that forward, I actually think there's going to be a lot of value that starts to accrue to the places that have really unique signal and really unique user interactions. The AI is only as good as the signal of home, which is acting. And when you look at it through that lens, we have a really unique signal at Pinterest. We've talked about this that unlike the rest of social media, we have very high commercial intent. But if you go further in that, it's not just we have commercial intent, it's not just that we know what people might click on or buy. These commercial journeys are long-lived, and users on Pinterest interestingly, are curating for the future. So we don't just know what people have done in the past. We know what they're planning to do in the future . When you think of the power of that signal and what that can do in terms of the power of recommendations that we can make to users, the advertising capabilities that we can open up with that I think we just have a lot of uniqueness in our signal from the fact that it's not just the people who are shopping here, they are curating here. They are not just saying, okay, here's the pair of shoes I'm interested in the hand value that I'm interested in or the dress that I'm interested in, they're saying, here's how I think about putting a great outfit together. And this handbag and these shoes go with distress, and that's being repeated across hundreds of millions of users on our platform. That is a completely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else, certainly not in the Western world. And that really unique signal as we're pairing that with those models, I think that's letting us do really unique things with the way that we can make recommendations. So when I talk about that relevancy, a really interesting thing to think about for us it's not even just that a search relevancy, you're saying, \"Okay, you search for the sign we give you the right thing. We're doing that on things like related items. And so to get to things like 94% plus relevancy, when we're doing broader sort of discovery for the user, that is exceptionally difficult, but is an example of us taking the models that are becoming more generally available for all and then applying them to really unique signals and really unique user interactions on our platform. So I feel that we are quite well positioned in the longer term sort of move towards next-gen AI and the dynamics there, I think, are quite favorable for us. And again, I think no better way than to demonstrate that in your results, and we've been doing that. I think your second question on demographic groups. We've noted this multiple times that Gen Z is our fastest-growing demographic and our largest contributor to overall engagement, which means it's not just a high growth rate on a small denominator, it's our largest contributor to overall engagement growth. That's a really interesting thing I've worked on a lot of different consumer products and a lot of different platforms. Generally, as you get a more mature platform or a more mature product, each successive cohort is a little less engaged, a little weaker. To be able to say that we have Gen Z a more recent cohort that's actually engaging even more deeply than our prior cohorts, I think is quite exceptional. And I think it gets to the fact that what we're solving with this ability to go from dreaming to doing and to use pents as a way to play in your future, whether that's in travel or in shopping I think that's really resonating in a lot of our next-gen experiences that we're bringing are resonating there as well, things like what we've done with shuffles and the ability to go even more uniquely curate these things, that's working quite well. Shopping , you asked about that specifically. I think we're finding that to be broadly resonant. And so not only is the shopping behavior broadly resonant across demographics, I mentioned that, that shopping behavior or sort of if you step back and say, doing more inspiration to action, we're seeing that work across other verticals and categories. That's quite encouraging for us as well like the travel sampling we've spoken about. Operator we'll take our last question. Thanks, Doug. I'll take your first one and then give Julie the second one. So our conversion API is important to hit. Our conversion API, we've only recently put that out there. It's been on the market less than a year. So we're early on with that. So to say what's keeping folks from adopting it, we're really pleased with the progress that we've been making on that. It's a recent product for us, and we've seen really significant uptake of that product. So we feel really good about it overall. But of course, we want to be faster, given the magnitude of its impact is so consequential for us and the advertiser. I think the spirit of your question of like, hey, how do we move along the adoption curve faster. We very much are mindful of that. So a few things that we're thinking about. The first is with that being a recently introduced product, we've really been getting our own go-to-market really tight in terms of how our sales team is engaging. The more we have proof points, I talked about having large sophisticated advertisers that are speaking about how impactful it's been for them. That - those reference points are really compelling that's really helping us drive better and better go-to-market with our first-party efforts there. But the other thing that we're doing is working to meet the advertisers where they are because there's a broad-based adoption curve on these things, it's not just us with the larger platforms are putting these things out there as well. And so advertisers are moving through an adoption curve on this. So we're making sure that we're working with third-party partners. We've mentioned some of them like LiveRamp and Tealium or Google Tag Manager and then certainly, our recent partnership with Amazon's ad platform, these are all examples of integrating to the platforms where those advertisers are already integrated. So that sort of multipronged approach of saying we're going to get better and better with our own go-to-market, which is working really well and advancing quite nicely as well as meeting the advertiser where they are. Those things are sort of the two-fronted approach of how we're accelerating that. And again, the most encouraging thing is that consistently as those advertisers adopt these measurement solutions, they're seeing better performance than they expected from us and increasing their spend with us. So we think that is right now, the balance of those advertisers given us a new product being tilted towards not yet having that tool while that creates some headwind for us. We talked about that cohort being a mid-single-digit decliner. But the ones that have adopted those tend to be growers on the order of 30%, that headwind flips around a tailwind as we get more of that balance of adoption. And we are seeing strong pull-through on that."

And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Ready: Thank you, Neil, and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Q1 was a strong quarter as we continue to deliver growth driven by foundational improvements in the core Pinterest experience and by continued focus on our strategic priorities and unique differentiators. We ended the quarter with 463 million monthly active users, up 7%. Furthermore, we accelerated growth among our global and UCAN or U.S. and Canada mobile app users similar to last quarter and our measures of engagement, including impressions, sessions and time spend continue to grow significantly faster than overall users, a testament to our work to deepen engagement per user. We generated revenue of $603 million, up approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. This strength came from the top and bottom of the funnel, including demand from our brand and performance objectives. As you saw in our press release, we announced a multiyear strategic third-party ad demand partnership with Amazon, which we believe can, over time, improve monetization with relevant ad content on the platform and increased shopability for users. I'll discuss this later in my remarks. While the overall demand environment remains challenging, we're demonstrating we can continue to grow our business while also operating with more efficiency. We delivered $27 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4% as our operating expenses came in lower than expected. This is due to a variety of cost reductions we achieved in the quarter as well as timing shifts that moved some expenses to Q2 and later in the year. Even with those timing shifts, we have confidence that the operational rigor we are driving in the business gives us a clear path to margin expansion in line with our prior commitments. This quarter, we continued to execute on our key strategic priorities, including: one, growing monetization and engagement per user; two, integrating shopping into the core of the product experience; three, improving operational rigor and therefore, margin expansion; and four, strengthening our leadership as a positive and brand-safe platform, including taking further steps to enhance the well-being of our users, especially teams. In Q1, we made solid progress in deepening engagement on the platform with our existing users. Users provide strong first-party signals to their actions on Pinterest, such as searching and browsing-related items as well as by saving pins on the curated boards that create product associations unique to our platform. This signal combined with our increasingly sophisticated AI models is driving improved relevancy and personalization for users. To that end, our mobile app users who are our most engaged and monetizable users and account for more than 80% of our total impressions and revenue grew 16% globally. U.S. and Canada mobile app user growth also accelerated to 7%, and our measures of engagement continued to grow faster than overall users, which is proof that users are coming back more frequently to Pinterest as they find more of what they're looking for on the platform. We continue to make good headway in adding new users, especially Gen Z users who grew double digits and continue to be our fastest growing demographic on the platform. Gen Z users are finding value in our positive and inspirational platform and are engaging with the full breadth of content including video. During the quarter, our video content on the platform grew nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter on top of the 30% sequential growth we drove in Q4. Furthermore, in March, we announced a new publisher deal with Dotdash Meredith, one of the largest publishers in America to bring video content to the platform across lifestyle, fashion, and food categories with brands including better homes and gardens, brides, food and wine, and all recipes. We\u2019re also finding that our blend of videos and images is resonating with users, as images remain a vital part of the Pinterest value proposition. Images in addition to video help users find inspiration relevant to them, refine what they\u2019re looking for and take action. Our corpus of images continues to grow even off a very large base, and we saw that that the number of boards grew double digits in Q1. The unique curation and depth of signal we drive speaks to the high intent of our audience and the lean forward experience we have on Pinterest. We\u2019re also improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full-funnel platform. At the top of the funnel, we\u2019re seeing strength and awareness objectives as we bring greater performance for advertisers. Also, our engagement wins are contributing to this growth by delivering more supply and favorable pricing. We\u2019ve been hard at work building new ad formats that our brand advertisers have been asking for. In Q1, we began testing Premiere Spotlight, our first premium awareness offering to showcase brands in an exclusive placement on our search page with advertisers like the Coca-Cola company. Based on early testing results, Premiere Spotlight ads drive significantly higher click-through rates on average compared to standard video awareness ads on Pinterest. We also remain focused on lower funnel objectives where we believe we have a much larger opportunity to deliver convergence to advertisers looking for sales. We\u2019re doing this by growing supply, better matching that supply with relevant demand and innovating on formats actionability and measurement capabilities. In Q1, whole page optimization, which we introduced in the prior quarter continue to drive more relevant ad impressions with impressions growing faster than sessions, even as engagement improves. As a result, our ads marketplace is getting more efficient, contributing to an 8% reduction in CPAs for performance advertisers. We\u2019ve also expanded our conversion ad products with mobile deep linking or MDL. We began beta testing MDL in Q3 of last year for shopping ads. And in Q1, MDL was the primary contributor to our shopping revenue growth, which was up 40% year-over-year. Building new ad tools and formats is only part of the equation for monetization success. The other part is helping advertisers measure those results through conversion visibility and attribution solutions. In Q1, we integrated our API for conversion with Tealium to drive further advertiser adoption, and we\u2019re in the process of onboarding advertisers like Wayfair onto our live ramp clean room solution in Q2. As I\u2019ve discussed previously, I also believe there\u2019s a meaningful opportunity for us to augment our auction with third-party ad demand. This is an important lever for us to increase the comprehensiveness of our ads thereby leading to greater relevance and shopability for users and ultimately improve monetization on the platform. We believe Amazon is the right first partner as we bring third-party demand onto Pinterest because they offer a breadth of relevant shoppable ad content paired with a seamless consumer buying experience. Their broad coverage of brands and products will help accelerate our efforts to take users from inspiration to action, satisfying more of the commercial intent that users have on our platform. We\u2019re excited about this partnership and the value it can bring to users and advertisers. A partnership of this scale will be a multi-quarter implementation, and therefore it may not be until next year that we see more meaningful revenue impact. Moving to shopping. In Q1, we continue to execute on our vision to build the home of taste based shopping. Our survey work consistently shows that over 50% of users view Pinterest as a place to shop, and our long-term goal is to make every pin shoppable. In Q1, we started integrating Shoppable Pins, our products you can take action on to the home feed and improving the overall distribution of this content through investments in our core relevancy algorithm. These changes are showing promising results. Click-through rates and saves of Shoppable Pins grew over 35% year-on-year. We\u2019re also exploring new formats to make shopping more fun and engaging. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we were testing shoppable Shuffles on Pinterest with the goal of allowing users to more seamlessly access Shoppable Pins from their collages. As we started integrating more Shuffles content into the main Pinterest app, we\u2019re seeing the Shuffles with the highest number of saves have shoppable content like outfit, wedding, and home ideas. As we make products more easily discoverable and shoppable, we\u2019re also enhancing merchant value on the platform. In the last six months, we\u2019ve seen nearly a 30% increase in attributed checkouts for merchants who upload their catalogs to the platform. As I\u2019ve mentioned in past quarters, I believe our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities is enhanced by instilling a culture of operational rigor, including discipline management of expenses. We\u2019re not a growth at all cost company and our actions have proven that since I joined. Shortly after I arrived last summer, we took steps to significantly slow our pace of hiring. In Q3, we kept headcount flat and began driving meaningful improvement in infrastructure spend in Q4, while returning to user growth. In Q1, we took further actions to drive longer term efficiency in our business through our restructuring plan, which we announced at the end of March. As part of this restructuring, we reduced our real estate footprint by downsizing or completely closing several of our offices around the globe as our flexible work policies do not require our historical levels of capacity. In addition, we made a 4% reduction in our workforce in early February to better align our talent against our top strategic priorities. We remain committed to delivering meaningful margin expansion this year, even if the demand environment takes longer to improve. Todd will address this further in his remarks. As we grow users and engagement, we\u2019re also investing in making Pinterest a more positive place on the internet, which is important for our users and advertisers. For many of our users, Pinterest is a personal space online where they can discover, grow and manifest their dreams. Several third party studies have shown that users feel safer on Pinterest than other platforms, and they feel more positive when on Pinterest. We think that\u2019s worth investing in. To do that, we\u2019ve taken steps to further enhance the safety and wellbeing of our users, especially minors. In late March, we made it mandatory for users to provide their birth dates so that we can provide age appropriate features and functionality. Pinterest is now private by default for existing and new users under the age of 16, and their content and profiles won\u2019t be discoverable by others studying a new bar for user wellbeing in this industry. Our investments in being a positive platform also make good business sense. As advertisers often side our positivity and brand safe environment as a reason for spending on the platform. Lastly, we\u2019re excited that Sabrina Ellis will be joining Pinterest as our Chief Product Officer. Sabrina is passionate about our mission to create a world where inspiration and wellbeing go hand in hand. I also want to thank Naveen Gavini for his 11 years of service and dedication to Pinterest. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Todd to go into more detail on our quarter in guidance.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Thanks, Bill. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll discuss our Q1 financial performance and our preliminary Q2 outllk. All financial metrics except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified. And as a reminder, all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Stepping back, this time last year, our users were declining and pricing on our platform was elevated. A lot has changed since then, our investments in the core Pinterest experience, including improvements in relevance and personalization are user reactivation engines and adding new content, including video, have been major contributors to user and engagement growth. Additionally, we saw pricing ease over the last two quarters as we unlocked more supply through engagement gains and ad load management on the platform. While digital advertising remains challenging, we\u2019re building for the long-term and we\u2019ve made significant progress to turn Pinterest into an attractive platform for advertisers through lower, mid, and upper funnel ad formats and tools, as well as new measurement solutions. Turning to users. In Q1, 463 million monthly active users came to Pinterest, growing 7%, adding roughly 30 million users compared to a year ago and growing across all regions. In the U.S. and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, growing 1%. We had 128 million monthly active users in Europe, which grew 7%, our strongest growth in two years. And in our rest of world markets, we had 240 million monthly active users up 9%. In addition to growing our users, our investments are driving more depth of engagement with our core and new users. We measure depth of engagement by looking at a basket of metrics such as impressions, sessions, and time spent. In Q1, these metrics grew faster than our user base, which indicates that we\u2019re making good progress on this front. Turning to our financial performance, Q1 global revenue of $603 million grew approximately 5% on a reported basis and 6% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our awareness objective demonstrated strong growth in the quarter as brand advertisers took advantage of higher engagement and lower CPMs on the platform. Revenue growth from our conversion objectives remained resilient as we continue to demonstrate the value of our lower funnel format and measurement products. International was also a strong contributor to growth and accounted for nearly 20% of total revenue buoyed by traction from large and SMB advertisers. Finally, emerging verticals were a source of strength with solid growth from several non-core categories such as travel and autos. Advertisers in these verticals are turning to Pinterest to harness the unique commercial intent that our users express on our platform. For example, Southwest Airlines leaned into spring break search activity on Pinterest by utilizing the Pinterest trends tool as a planning guide. Southwest featured Pins of exciting destinations that drove flight searches on their site. Breaking out revenue by region, U.S. and Canada revenue was $486 million, an increase of 3%. Total revenue from Europe was $93 million, growing 12% on a constant currency basis or 6% on a reported basis. And total revenue from our rest of world region was $24 million, growing 42% on a constant currency basis and 38% on a reported basis. We\u2019re confident that the intent-based shopping mindset that our users bring when they come to Pinterest, coupled with improvements in shopping on the platform and our conversion-based ads business will bode well for advertisers in the long term. Now I\u2019d like to discuss our expense profile and EBITDA. Cost of revenue came in at $167 million and declined 6% sequentially as we continued to efficiently manage our infrastructure costs. Operating expenses were $413 million for the quarter, a 15% increase year-over-year, and a 19% decrease quarter-over-quarter. This was lower than our guidance for two reasons. First, we shifted some investments from Q1 into Q2, and later in the year, And second, we made further progress on our expense control across business functions. Adjusted EBITDA was $27 million in the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4%. As Bill mentioned, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of March in order to reallocate our resources against our highest priority areas. This resulted in a charge of approximately $121 million of which $113 million is non-cash. On our capital allocation strategy, as we mentioned last quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million to help manage dilution from stock-based compensation. We\u2019ve made progress repurchasing over $100 million worth of shares through April 2024. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Before I discuss our Q2 financial guidance, I wanted to provide some additional context on our monthly active user trends. Q2 is our seasonally softest quarter as people tend to travel and spend more time outside starting in June. This seasonality is particularly pronounced for us as we measure monthly active users on a 30-day look back from the last day in June. In addition, we expect that some of the recent updates we made like mandatory birthday collection will moderate the rate of year-over-year growth in the second quarter. However, we continue to invest in product experiences that we believe will grow users, drive deeper engagement and improve monetizable supply over time. Now onto our revenue guidance. The ads market continues to be uncertain, given the macroeconomic environment. We\u2019ve seen stabilization and while Q1 growth was marginally better than Q4, we still did not have visibility into an acceleration in demand. As a result, we expect our second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly consistent with the growth we saw over the last two quarters in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. While foreign exchange headwinds are moderating, we still expect a small impact in Q2, which is reflected in our guide. Moving to our non-GAAP operating expense outlook. We expect our Q2 operating expenses to grow low teams percentage points quarter-over-quarter, partially due to shifting some investments from Q1 to Q2. As a reminder, our OpEx outlook does not include the cost of revenue. Finally, as it relates to stock-based compensation, our annual employee equity merit awards will be granted in the second quarter, so we expect stock-based compensation to increase sequentially from Q1 levels. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill for some final comments.\nBill Ready: I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s execution to deliver strong results in Q1. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re making the appropriate investments that will position us to gain share when the demand environment returns. Also, we\u2019re excited to share more about our progress and long-term strategy at our first Investor Day, which we\u2019re currently planning for September. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the broader revenue commentary from the letter and your comments on the call. Can you just help us parse out a little bit of how the outside environment or the environment outside of your control is impacting elements of verticals or types of advertising, like brand advertising or direct response advertising versus the potential for tailwinds to build in your business around some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve been trying to build 2022 going into 2023, and how we should be thinking about those headwinds and tailwinds looking out over the next two to three quarters. Thanks so much.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the question. So first thing I\u2019d say we feel really great about the quarter and the progress we\u2019ve made on revenue. From everything we\u2019ve seen, we continue to grow faster than the industry on revenue. So while there\u2019s still some challenge in the macro environment. When we look at our performance relative to the broader advertising industry, we feel really good about that. As we decompose, what\u2019s happening in our revenue, what we\u2019re seeing is that there\u2019s a lot to be really excited about in terms of those advertisers that are implementing our measurement solutions like conversion API and clean rooms consistently find that they\u2019re getting better performance from Pinterest than what they had previously understood. And as they see that, they double down and invest more in Pinterest. So as the industry goes through an adoption curve on privacy safe measurement solutions, we think that bodes quite well for Pinterest given the high intent on our platform and the way that we\u2019re leaning into better ad platform performance and seeing increasing engagement from our users so that there\u2019s great supply on the platform for those advertisers to connect with. In fact, I think that\u2019s one of the real highlights of the quarter is that not only have we clearly demonstrated our return to user growth. But as we\u2019ve talked about before, there\u2019s sort of compounding layers there where our user growth being at 7% compares to our engagement growth that is solidly in the double digit range. And then our ad impressions aided by whole page optimization where we can bring dynamic ad load with greater relevance for users is north of 30% growth. And so there\u2019s multiple layers of growth there, and while the demand environment still has puts and takes in it. I think all that bodes really well for where we sit in the medium to long term. And in the near term, visibility remains a challenge and you have puts and takes, like for example, consumer spending and retail broadly for the whole retail industry down in February and March. It\u2019s a bit in my mind, premature to call an acceleration when you still have those kinds of things out there in the macro. But our relative performance, we\u2019ve grown faster than others in the space. We feel like we continue to take share and what we hear from advertisers implementing our latest, best ad solutions, including things like conversion API and clean rooms, we perform really well and gain share of wallet as they\u2019ve implemented those things. I think that\u2019s a very positive trend for us over the medium to long term, even though near term visibility, given the macro remains a challenge. I think on the second part of your question with regard to Amazon and the third party ad demand partnership there. As I\u2019ve shared on prior calls, relative to the significant amount of commercial intent on Pinterest, I think we are a platform that is still under monetized relative to the amount of intent on the platform. And so, you see us, I mentioned driving a 30% plus increase in ad impressions on the platform even while driving up engagement. This shows as we bring more relevant ads onto the platform that is not only aiding our revenue growth, aiding advertiser value, it\u2019s good for users. And a commercial context ads can be great content. So coming back to the third party demand opportunity we see a significant opportunity to bring more relevant ads onto the platform from a greater breadth of brands and products. And when we look at Amazon as a first partner, they bring great breaths on brands and products paired with a really great consumer buying experience that we think can aid progress on shopability in our platform. Finally, I\u2019ll just say, back to your question of what\u2019s in our control. We\u2019ve talked a lot about shopping on our platform, our early indicators of success on shopping. We could not feel better about as we have brought more shoppable content into our core surfaces. We\u2019ve seen 30% plus increases in engagement on shoppable pins and 30% plus year-on-year increase in attributed checkouts for merchants who are uploading their catalogs to us. So, the question of can we take users from window shopping to taking action. We have very strong signs of progress there, and while that\u2019ll be a multi-year adoption curve, we couldn\u2019t feel better about the progress that we\u2019re making there.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for all the color.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Eric. \nNeil Doshi: Operator, our next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I have two. The first one kind of goes back to your comment you made about window shopping and sort of changing the user experience being more shoppable. It seems like a lot of generative AI and a lot of new tools that are coming could really help that in a material way. I guess talk to us about how long you think that could take to really have meaningful impact on the revenue and how should we think about the potential near-term investments and the gross margin pressure from pushing more machine learning and AI investment into the P&L? And then Todd, just one on MAUs and users. As we\u2019re going through the 2Q commentary, are you expecting the North America users to be up sequentially, so through those puts and takes or how are you thinking through the users and the guidance? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. On the impact of next generation AI, it is here, you see it in our results. When we look at the significant progress we\u2019ve made on user engagement that is largely driven by improvements we have made in personalization and relevancy for users and really applying NextGen AI techniques including things like GPUs but pairing those with the really unique signal on our platform. Again, I think I\u2019ve shared a little bit of commentary about this in the past. I think the primitives of generative AI are going to be broadly accessible via cloud compute. I think we\u2019re going to be real differentiators are what are the places that have really unique signal upon which to train that AI? The AI is only as good as a signal upon which it\u2019s acting. And we have really unique first party signal not just around the intent of the user, but about things like product associations from the really unique activity that happens on our platform, like boards and curation that associates products together in ways that let us make really great conclusions through our AI training on those signals unique to our platform. So when you look at the improvements in user relevancy in the personalization there, there\u2019s a lot of work around AI that is driving those things. To your next part of the question around, the gross margin impacts and what does that mean? Yes, these things as measured on their own, can be \u2013 we can provide additional expense, but we also see them linking into greater revenue for us already as well. So, for example, using larger AI models and GPUs has been part of our progress in our ad stack. So a tangible example of that as we\u2019ve been testing the deployment of significantly larger AI models for more relevant ads. Our CPC campaign saw a greater than 5% increase in click through rate. In the world of ad stack optimization, a 5% plus increase in click through rate is phenomenal. And so we\u2019re leaning heavily into that. It\u2019s been a core competency for us for a long time. So we\u2019re leaning heavily into that and applying it to and applying that to the unique signals on our platform. And last point, the shopability progress that we\u2019ve been making there. I hit a few of these points already, but it\u2019s another place where AI\u2019s helping us a lot on those product recommendations and relevancy. And again, as we\u2019ve started to bring shoppable content into the core of our product, into the main surfaces, we\u2019re seeing 35% \u2013 greater than 35% increase in engagement on shoppable pins. And we\u2019re seeing things like our shopping ad revenue continuing to grow 40% plus year-on-year improvements in the buying experience like mobile delinking being a significant driver of that 40% increase in shopping ad revenue. So again, the proof points of are the users \u2013 are the users not only going to window shop, but are they going to take action? Are they going to engage further really strong, really clear proof points on that. And NextGen AI is a big part of how we\u2019re powering those things behind the scenes, particularly when paired with the really unique signal on our platform. I\u2019ll give it Todd for the other part of your question.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes, a couple one addition to what Bill had talked about, obviously, the investments in infrastructure, we\u2019d expect to have a return. But from a financial perspective, Brian, you\u2019re probably looking at the gross margin being at 72% this quarter versus where we were a year ago. And to Bill\u2019s point, we\u2019re getting a return on that, but the Q1 revenue that we see is seasonally weakest \u2013 seasonally the softest quarter in the year. And while we would expect that we\u2019ll invest more dollars after two quarters of sequential declines in infrastructure, we would expect to start spending more absolute dollars in infrastructure or our cost of revenue. Given the seasonality in revenue, we would expect to see some operating leverage against that line. So I think that's the financial interpretation of the returns that Bill was describing. In terms of the user question and what you're asking about in terms of seasonality, it's important to remember, the way we measure our users and report is a 30-day look back at the end of every quarter. And so in the second quarter this year, we'll look back across the month of June. That is the month where people tend to be out and about, and we've seen our seasonally softest quarter as a result of that in the second quarter. So typically, Q1 to Q2 users our MAU count has been seasonally our softest quarter. In addition to that, this year, we're making some product investments in a better user experience and leading the industry around privacy centres them with our user base. And that will moderate our year-over-year growth in our \u2013 so we have a company impact of \u2013 from a year-over-year perspective, some product investments that we think are good for our users over the long-term, coupled with a seasonally soft quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thank you both.\nBill Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hi, everybody. Bill, a quick question on the Amazon deal to follow up on the previous one. I think some folks on the line here, including me, probably a little surprised given your prior role that you guys went with Amazon. So can you walk us through like what was it about the setup here that made them the first one? Is there exclusivity or not, which I think you had said previously that it wasn't going to be exclusive. And then yes, what portions of inventory is this going to be applied to? Is it kind of across the board? Or is there going to be certain like geos or product types that this kind of partnership makes the most sense? And is the CPM going to be on a net basis, I think that would be helpful to get a clarification on. And then Todd, just one quick follow-up on the macro. The U.S. decelerated a tab in the first quarter and given all the momentum in shopping ads, [indiscernible] anything to call out there on the U.S. ad rev?\nBill Ready: Thanks, Ross. Appreciate the questions. So on the Amazon deal, I've pretty consistently commented that in a future state, we'd imagine that we would ingest third-party demand from multiple different parties, which I think is consistent with what you would see from most mature ad platforms out there that you have multiple sources of third-party demand augment in the auction. So without commenting on any other party, we chose Amazon as our first partner because we saw not only a really great opportunity to bring more brands and more products onto the platform, which we think can help comprehensiveness and shopability, but it's also paired with a really great consumer buying experience. I talked about the fantastic progress we're making in shopping overall as well as lower funnel \u2013 lower funnel objectives where we're driving strength there also with shopping and conversion objectives. So having a great consumer buying experience, we think really helps us take a step forward on our overall shopping efforts and is great for users, great for advertisers. So we felt like that was a key contributor to why Amazon is a great first partner for us. And in state, we'll have other partners. There is nothing that precludes us from that in the long term in the near term. We want to make sure we get this first partnership really right, as I shared it's going to be a multi quarter implementation. And so in the near-term, we'll be focused on making sure that we get that really right in the medium to long term. This is a broader move to leveraging third-party demand on the platform to enhance our comprehensiveness, our relevance for users and our shopability. And again, we feel great about this as a first step. You had some other detailed questions on the deal that might be a little bit more detailed and I can answer, but the overall \u2013 I think we feel great that there's fantastic mutual value in this for us and our partner, Amazon. And we think that can be the same for how we continue to work with other partners across the industry. So again, feel great about the progress there, not just in the partnership, but really what it means for users and bringing advertiser value onto our platform.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Yes. And Ross, on the question about U.S. Canada revenue growth, I would look back over a two year stack. And if you look at it on that basis, we had a little bit of a harder comp over a year ago period. So if you look at it over two years, we're pretty consistent at around 18%. However, within that, Bill talked about this at the outset around what we're seeing in pockets of our advertiser base. For those advertisers who have capital, who value positivity and brand safety, they value the insights-led selling that we can offer against the commercial intent of our users and who have adopted and see quality performance using our latest measurement solutions. We talked a lot about conversion API. We talked about clean room solutions. Those advertisers are performing exceptionally well, but you can look at the headlines and see that not everyone in retail is performing as well. So there is a mix of performance in some of these segments.\nRoss Sandler: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. I'm going to stick with the Amazon partnership and general partner monetization theme and perhaps drag you into the weeds here, Bill. But we talked to a lot of investors about this, who just don't understand the basic nuts and bolts of it. So to the extent you can elaborate more about how the Amazon partnership will work with the other like retail media network partnerships? How they'll work from a nuts and bolts perspective? Like is this Amazon kind of deploying their advertisers' budget on Pinterest? Is it also Amazon deploying their own budget or all of the kind of clicks kind of drive people back to Amazon? Anything you can share to just help explain at a basic level, how it's going to work in practice? And then the second one related to this is just like thinking about the geographical benefit of this and other partnerships. I guess our impulse has been to think that you all have been kind of slow to migrate the ad business outside the U.S., and there's a lot of markets where you have a lot of engagement already, but you just don't have a big ad business yet, is there any reason to think you can't leverage these partnerships to get kind of like a U.S. market share level of digital and other international markets on the back of these? Are we right to think that's one of the big benefits of these partnerships?\nBill Ready: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lloyd, so a lot to unpack there. So your macro \u2013 the macro point in your question, which is spot on, is that our platform \u2013 I talked about this before, our platform overall, it's a nascent \u2013 a more nascent ad platform. And relative to the very high consumer commercial intent on our platform, we're quite under monetized. And there's a real opportunity for us to simultaneously drive better user engagement through highly relevant ads that help users satisfy commercial intent while also driving up revenue on the platform. So you've seen that with like our whole page optimization and the fact that we're able to grow ad load 30% plus, while still having positive progress on engagement. This demonstrates that highly relevant ads that help the user satisfy their intent can be great content for the user and be enhancing both engagement and revenue simultaneously. So that's our macro opportunity. As you rightly called out, while we are under monetized overall, we are really under monetized internationally. And if you look at our results, you see really positive growth on a percentage basis internationally for us, which is evidence that there's a lot more potential there. And so that's something we're investing in directly with our first-party sales, but also something where we think partnerships can certainly be helpful in accelerating that progress. And so we think that overall, there's a significant opportunity to drive the monetization of our platform at a much greater rate than growth in not only users but also growth sort of engagement that we can drive monetization faster than that, particularly as we're demonstrating good results for advertisers, particularly as they implement new measurement tools, new privacy safe tools. So we feel like that is a significant opportunity for us and partnerships can definitely be helpful there. One other part \u2013 I think \u2013 sorry, one other part of your question I didn't answer. You asked about sort of teasing apart the nuances of Amazon. Like one thing in your question that again, I probably can't go into extremely nitty-gritty detail, but this is Amazon ads, not Amazon as a retailer. We certainly \u2013 you could have found lots of Amazon ads on our platform previously from Amazon as a retailer. This is Amazon ads. And so this is bringing ads from brands and other products that are leveraging the Amazon ad platform. That Amazon ad platform, one of the things that we're quite excited about is that it does also bring great buying experiences. And those buying experiences can include things for other brands and retailers. And so that is part of what is compelling about this partnership is that its \u2013 in an ad platform with a lot of brands, a lot of products that can help drive comprehensiveness for our users, but also paired with the great buying experience for the many retailers and brands that are participating in the Amazon ad platform.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Well, thank you. Congrats on the deal.\nBill Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield from LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve got one, I guess when you think about video, I think Bill, you \u2013 last quarter you said something like 10% of time spent was video, but it was like 30% of your revenue. And I\u2019m just wondering as you think about sort of the power of video you talked about sort of the increase in video content on the platform, but I guess I\u2019m curious sort of how much time spent to that how that 10% may have changed, and as we look through the remainder of 2023, given the importance of video consumption, not video content, but actually the consumption of the video is to driving your revenue, how should we think about like what you\u2019re doing and how the sort of the video transition of the content? I know it\u2019s not removing sort of pictures, but how do you think about that video transition over the course of 2023? And then just a quick follow-up on Amazon, just to try to synthesize everything you said is the ultimate takeaway that we\u2019re going to end up seeing far more shoppable ads because of this Amazon partnership as it sort of gets implemented. If we looked at Pinterest on a \u2013 if we scroll through Pinterest when we feel like there\u2019ll be a far greater number of shoppable ads between now and the end of the year at this plays out. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yes. To the last part of your question, yes. In \u2013 you\u2019re already seeing that happen where previously users \u2013 more than half of users said they were coming to Pinterest to shop. Pinterest was really solving digital window shopping, but the actionability was low. So it\u2019s sort of like Pinterest was solving digital window shopping, but the stores were closed. We are opening the stores. And the comments I made around the progress that we already have with shopping ads growing 40% year-on-year, mobile deep linking driving great conversion and being a big driver behind that growth. The 35% increase in engagement on Shoppable Pins, as we\u2019re bringing those onto our main surfaces, it\u2019s already the case that users are starting to find that much more of the things that they were finding on Pinterest before that they would\u2019ve found on Pinterest, but couldn\u2019t take action on Pinterest, which was leaked engagement to other platforms and leaked monetization to other platforms, they\u2019re now able to take action on directly on Pinterest. And so our goal is to make every pins shoppable. That\u2019s a long-term goal that won\u2019t all get solved in a single year, but we feel really good about the progress that we\u2019re already making. And yes, we think this partnership absolutely can help contribute to that. As I said before, it\u2019s a multi-quarter implementation. And so I think we\u2019ll see more of that effect coming into next year. But separate from just the one partnership, just overall, we\u2019re already seeing your macro point of like will users see more actionability on the platform? They already are great progress on it. And as we get to this holiday shopping season, we would expect that users are going to be able to engage with much more of the shoppable content on Pinterest than what they would\u2019ve previously. That\u2019s due to efforts that we already have in flight that are already in front of users and that we\u2019re growing aggressively. But it\u2019ll also be augmented by what we do with third-party partnerships like the one with Amazon. On your video point, so video continues to be north of 10% of our engagement. It\u2019s also the case that it continues to be a significantly greater percentage of our monetization. So this dynamic that we described last quarter, where last quarter I talked about, we\u2019ve got 10% plus of our engagement on video, but 30% plus of our revenue, we continue to see that kind of dynamic. And your question about the interplay between video and images, we feel like we\u2019re finding a really great balance between those two things. We have a format that is bringing both videos and images to the user in a simultaneously versus those being separate surfaces. And as we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s resonating well with users, because again users come here with intent and with purpose, and sometimes that intent and purpose is aided by video, and they have the option to engage with that. But oftentimes as they want to go refine that intent, get closer to actionability images can help them a lot with that as well. And so we continue to work through that optimization, but we feel like we\u2019re getting that balance to a good place, and we\u2019re going to continue to lean into the balance of those two things, that that that gives the user the best of both world, because we see that users absolutely want both, and both those things helps the users drive more actionability. Last thing I\u2019ll say on video, I talked about how the video corpus is growing. Our image corpus continues to grow as well. The fact that our Boards are growing 10% plus is also a good indication of the core activities that user engage with on a platform. As we are leaning into those, those are not only alive and well, but things that users are engaging with more and more. And I talked about Gen Z, as our fastest growing demographic. They\u2019re also \u2013 Gen Z is the fastest growing demographic is not just about a big growth rate on a small denominator. Gen Z is a \u2013 is the largest contributor of engagement growth as we talk about engagement growth. So we \u2013 to put it very pointedly, we are winning with Gen Z. And I think this was a big question about the platform a year ago. We\u2019ve returned to user growth. We\u2019re clearly winning with Gen Z and winning with Gen Z in a unique way where we don\u2019t need to win with them on where they go for entertainment. We\u2019re winning with them on where they go when they have intent and purpose and where they go when they\u2019re looking for an oasis away from the toxicity of the rest of social media. And that\u2019s working quite well for us, including how we\u2019re leaning into more investments in their wellbeing on our platform.\nRich Greenfield: But we shouldn\u2019t think about video being 20% or plus like that\u2019s not your goal for a year from now. It\u2019s more about balance versus a dramatic scaling up of time spent being video.\nBill Ready: Yes. We are very focused on what gives the user the best satisfaction of their intent and their purpose. And what we\u2019re finding with that is that\u2019s a balance of video and images, and you can expect us to continue progressing that in a thoughtful methodical way that helps the user satisfy their intent. And in a way, a big contrast from us with other platforms, most other platforms are talking about video as a headwind to revenue. And you\u2019re hearing us talk about video is helping to drive engagement, but we have more revenue on video than we have on engagement. So that\u2019s sort of the inverse of what you\u2019d see on other platforms. We think we can continue to manage it in that kind of fashion. Hopefully that helps.\nNeil Doshi: All right. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I guess a couple questions for me as well. I guess first off, curious if there\u2019s anything else to call out with respect to the acceleration in international users and revenues, obviously I think as Lloyd mentioned, and you guys mentioned that\u2019s a huge monetization opportunity and showing good progress there. And then we\u2019re getting a few questions on the expense guide for Q2 this sequential increase. I think it might be helpful, Todd to understand a little bit more unpack the moving parts there. Some of the timing shift and then does that serve as the baseline for modeling the sequential trend in the expenses for the rest of the year? I think more color there might be helpful. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yes. On the international side, I\u2019d say, first thing is back to the user point, what we are doing to deliver great engagement for users is working well across geography. So our return to user growth is happening across geographies both [indiscernible] and international. And so in terms of our platform returning to user growth and bringing more supply onto the platform that\u2019s consistent across geographies, we feel great about that. I think your point on monetization, we are a fraction of the monetization that we could be internationally. And particularly when you look at places like Europe that there\u2019s clear line of sight to how there\u2019s more monetization opportunity in places like Europe. Our growth rates, you can see the growth rates there are high, but the denominators are low. And we think that\u2019s a lot of go forward potential with us. But those high growth rates even on a small denominator, I think are the good indications of as we build out those investments, as we build out our ad capabilities in those international markets. Our sales teams are able to go make effective progress there. And we think there\u2019s a lot more of that to come. Finally on international, we called out large advertisers are growing with us there, and we have SMB growth and international as well. So a good balanced mix of where we think there\u2019s opportunity in international for us.\nTodd Morgenfeld: And then on \u2013 Colin, on the expense guide, if you remember back, we\u2019ve talked about this for a couple of quarters, we had a big increase in expenses last year that were largely payroll driven or headcount based. So in the first half of last year, we had a lot of attrition in the first quarter, we backfilled and accelerated hiring going into the end of Q2. And then as Bill referenced in his opening comments, we paused the rate of hiring in early Q3 and then that those efforts kind of accelerated as we moved into the end of last year and then through Q1. We also have called out historically that we had a lot of marketing spend that was variable in nature in the back half of last year that drove a lot of our expense growth in Q3 and Q4. We\u2019re lapping as a result of all of those comments. We\u2019re lapping the payroll expense growth as we go into Q3 and Q4. And then in the back half of the year, we\u2019re lapping a lot of variable marketing spend. The implication of all of that is that we will see a deceleration in year-over-year expense growth that will pick up next quarter and then accelerate going to Q3 and Q4, which will drive the margin improvement that we\u2019ve been talking about now for a few quarters.  So I know the guide suggests that we'll see a step up in sequential expenses, a lot of that is timing around a couple of marketing programs and other investments that we're making, but we would not expect to see that continue to grow in absolute dollar terms, and certainly as a percentage of revenue, we would expect to see that decelerate dramatically over the course of especially the back half of the year.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks so much for taking questions. I just wanted to take another stab at the 2Q revenue outlook. I guess, just trying to understand, is it really purely just caution on macro that kind of keeps you a little bit more muted perhaps and in the range of 4Q and 1Q versus acceleration that we're seeing from others in the industry. And as part of that, are you seeing any notable differences between omni-channel and just pure e-com? And then second, just related to AI, can you just kind of parse out how \u2013 it's clear you're using AI, how to think about it across rankings and recommendations and ad monetization, but then also how will users of Pinterest take advantage of generative AI tools going forward? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yes. So I think on sort of what we're seeing on the macro, as I shared before, there's a lot that we feel great about, but there are puts and takes out there. I think as in \u2013 the fact that we're growing revenue faster than the broader industry, I think is something that \u2013 we certainly feel great about. That's hard fought. But we feel great that we're growing revenue faster than the industry. And we have \u2013 as I shared earlier, the number of things that give us confidence that we're demonstrating good value for advertisers, even as those advertisers are digesting a lot of change. I think as compare us to others, I think there are places that maybe that are strengths for us, that are strengths for others, like international, small business and international, those kinds of things. But those are a smaller portion of our overall business. But you do see those accelerating for us as well. They're just a smaller portion of our overall business. But when you look at multiple major platforms still having year-on-year declines, and we're putting up solid growth, and we feel like we've got \u2013 even though, visibility is limited, we feel like we've got visibility to continue growth even as other larger platforms some of which are still seeing year-on-year declines. I think that's good indication of our relative performance, and I don't see that changing. We just see that visibility is limited and it feels premature to call a bottom, when you have things like consumer spending on retail still declining year-on-year. So our view of the medium and long-term, we could not feel better about. In fact, if I go back to our strategic priorities and where we were a year ago, as Todd mentioned in his script, a year ago, we'd had multiple quarters of year-on-year decline with users. We were a supply constrained platform. Advertiser value was in question, because that \u2013 the supply constraints where we sit today, we have return to user growth. We are clearly growing with Gen Z as our fastest growing demographic. We're delivering great value for advertisers. And the more advertisers implement better measurement, the more they see that we're delivering value for them. Shopping on the platform that was a real question a year ago of like, could we drive more shopping behavior, very strong proof points on that, even though we're early on in adoption curve. All those things on every one of our strategic comparatives, we've executed and I think our, beyond the progress we would have expected and with add impressions up 30% plus, had demand been constant, the growth will be screaming, right? But we can't predict when demand volatility sort of goes back to normal better than anybody else. And there continue to be a lot of puts and takes, and I think you see that reflected in others commentary with they're also calling either experiencing year-on-your declines or calling that visibility is still poor for them as well as evidenced by wide ranges and outcomes and those kinds of things.\nTodd Morgenfeld: Doug, can you just repeat your second question?\nDoug Anmuth: Just on AI, kind of how users will take advantage of generative AI tools on the Pinterest platform?\nBill Ready: Yes. I think, we are looking at this \u2013 with generative AI, we think there's a lot we can do to deliver better experiences in ways that the user that will feel natural for the user. And I think that's what you're seeing from us already, that we're using next generation AI to bring better recommendations, more shopability, better product experiences, ads that are more relevant and convert better. So you're already seeing that in the platform. So we're thinking about ways that we can bring next generation AI to users in a way that feels natural to them. And given that we're a highly visual platform, we think we'll have a lot more of those kinds of opportunities around great recommendations, users making collages on shuffles. There's a lot of great AI that's behind the way that we're doing those kinds of things. So there's a lot of that kind of stuff that you already are seeing from us, where we're going to be methodical about it. There's still a lot of open questions out there around how do you make sure there's good value exchange between platforms and publishers? How do you make sure that there are image rights and all these kinds of things that are \u2013 these are meaningful issues that we're going to be thoughtful and methodical about and we're not going to rush into sort of head first. But we're finding really great ways to leverage this technology that's already driving user benefits, and you can expect to see more of that from us.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you.\nNeil Doshi: Operator, we'll take one last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Good afternoon. Sounds like you're seeing really strong growth on mobile. And Bill, just curious how mobile or location becomes an element of the customer signal that maybe you're able to leverage in addition to the lean forward behavior element or the growth in boards. I'm just curious if that figures into your thinking at all. And then maybe just \u2013 a second one curious how you feel about assembling your team and leadership at the company and curious if the Analyst Day announcement, tentative plan, appreciate is another announcement. Thank you\nBill Ready: So on your second question around the team, feel great about the team that we have. This is a team that's winning. This is a team that's delivering great results. And you've seen us, doing that consistently over the last three quarters. And so these things are oftentimes relay races. And so even in places where we've had somebody who's led a strong leg of the race, we've brought in great talent to augment the next leg of the race. And so if part of your question there was around, our CFO transition, I'd say, it's a good opportunity for what I was already planning to do, which is to thank Todd again for having ran a really strong leg of the race probably a couple legs of the race given how long he's been here and how thoughtful he's been in the transition. And so while we don't have new news to share there right now, we've seen exceptional engagement from a number of candidates and we feel quite confident that process is progressing on track, both in terms of how thoughtful and engaged Todd has been in managing that transition, as well as our ability to make sure that we're going to have great talent going forward there as well. Sabrina, who I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, I think he is going to be a fantastic addition to the team, even as we also say thank you to Naveen, who also ran multiple really strong legs of the race for us as well. So that part we feel great about. And so on the mobile part of it, to the first part of your question, again, another really positive part of our progress, as I shared, 80% plus of our engagement and revenue comes from mobile app users. And those mobile app users both in [indiscernible] and international, growing much faster for us than users overall. So our most engaged users are growing the fastest, and that's giving us the opportunity to have greater depths of engagement. So the progress on mobile feels great. Without commenting on sort of future product announcements for those kinds of things, having the user in our mobile app, lets us control our destiny much more. And we feel fantastic about the progress there and what that lets us do to drive deeper and deeper engagement for users and deliver greater value for advertisers. So with that, again, thank you everybody for the questions. Thank you again, Todd. Since this is the last earnings call. Thank you again for a fantastic tenure here at Pinterest. Very much appreciate the partnership. Thank you to everyone on the call. Thank you to all our customers, our team members and we look forward to continuing conversation with all of you. Thank you,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today\u2019s call is now concluded. We'd like thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Todd Morgenfeld",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. In my remarks today, I'll discuss our Q1 financial performance and our preliminary Q2 outllk. All financial metrics except for revenue will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified. And as a reminder, all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Stepping back, this time last year, our users were declining and pricing on our platform was elevated. A lot has changed since then, our investments in the core Pinterest experience, including improvements in relevance and personalization are user reactivation engines and adding new content, including video, have been major contributors to user and engagement growth. Additionally, we saw pricing ease over the last two quarters as we unlocked more supply through engagement gains and ad load management on the platform. While digital advertising remains challenging, we're building for the long-term and we've made significant progress to turn Pinterest into an attractive platform for advertisers through lower, mid, and upper funnel ad formats and tools, as well as new measurement solutions. Turning to users. In Q1, 463 million monthly active users came to Pinterest, growing 7%, adding roughly 30 million users compared to a year ago and growing across all regions. In the U.S. and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, growing 1%. We had 128 million monthly active users in Europe, which grew 7%, our strongest growth in two years. And in our rest of world markets, we had 240 million monthly active users up 9%. In addition to growing our users, our investments are driving more depth of engagement with our core and new users. We measure depth of engagement by looking at a basket of metrics such as impressions, sessions, and time spent. In Q1, these metrics grew faster than our user base, which indicates that we're making good progress on this front. Turning to our financial performance, Q1 global revenue of $603 million grew approximately 5% on a reported basis and 6% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our awareness objective demonstrated strong growth in the quarter as brand advertisers took advantage of higher engagement and lower CPMs on the platform. Revenue growth from our conversion objectives remained resilient as we continue to demonstrate the value of our lower funnel format and measurement products. International was also a strong contributor to growth and accounted for nearly 20% of total revenue buoyed by traction from large and SMB advertisers. Finally, emerging verticals were a source of strength with solid growth from several non-core categories such as travel and autos. Advertisers in these verticals are turning to Pinterest to harness the unique commercial intent that our users express on our platform. For example, Southwest Airlines leaned into spring break search activity on Pinterest by utilizing the Pinterest trends tool as a planning guide. Southwest featured Pins of exciting destinations that drove flight searches on their site. Breaking out revenue by region, U.S. and Canada revenue was $486 million, an increase of 3%. Total revenue from Europe was $93 million, growing 12% on a constant currency basis or 6% on a reported basis. And total revenue from our rest of world region was $24 million, growing 42% on a constant currency basis and 38% on a reported basis. We're confident that the intent-based shopping mindset that our users bring when they come to Pinterest, coupled with improvements in shopping on the platform and our conversion-based ads business will bode well for advertisers in the long term. Now I'd like to discuss our expense profile and EBITDA. Cost of revenue came in at $167 million and declined 6% sequentially as we continued to efficiently manage our infrastructure costs. Operating expenses were $413 million for the quarter, a 15% increase year-over-year, and a 19% decrease quarter-over-quarter. This was lower than our guidance for two reasons. First, we shifted some investments from Q1 into Q2, and later in the year, And second, we made further progress on our expense control across business functions. Adjusted EBITDA was $27 million in the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4%. As Bill mentioned, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of March in order to reallocate our resources against our highest priority areas. This resulted in a charge of approximately $121 million of which $113 million is non-cash. On our capital allocation strategy, as we mentioned last quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million to help manage dilution from stock-based compensation. We've made progress repurchasing over $100 million worth of shares through April 2024. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Before I discuss our Q2 financial guidance, I wanted to provide some additional context on our monthly active user trends. Q2 is our seasonally softest quarter as people tend to travel and spend more time outside starting in June. This seasonality is particularly pronounced for us as we measure monthly active users on a 30-day look back from the last day in June. In addition, we expect that some of the recent updates we made like mandatory birthday collection will moderate the rate of year-over-year growth in the second quarter. However, we continue to invest in product experiences that we believe will grow users, drive deeper engagement and improve monetizable supply over time. Now onto our revenue guidance. The ads market continues to be uncertain, given the macroeconomic environment. We've seen stabilization and while Q1 growth was marginally better than Q4, we still did not have visibility into an acceleration in demand. As a result, we expect our second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly consistent with the growth we saw over the last two quarters in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. While foreign exchange headwinds are moderating, we still expect a small impact in Q2, which is reflected in our guide. Moving to our non-GAAP operating expense outlook. We expect our Q2 operating expenses to grow low teams percentage points quarter-over-quarter, partially due to shifting some investments from Q1 to Q2. As a reminder, our OpEx outlook does not include the cost of revenue. Finally, as it relates to stock-based compensation, our annual employee equity merit awards will be granted in the second quarter, so we expect stock-based compensation to increase sequentially from Q1 levels. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for some final comments. Yes, a couple one addition to what Bill had talked about, obviously, the investments in infrastructure, we'd expect to have a return. But from a financial perspective, Brian, you're probably looking at the gross margin being at 72% this quarter versus where we were a year ago. And to Bill's point, we're getting a return on that, but the Q1 revenue that we see is seasonally weakest \u2013 seasonally the softest quarter in the year. And while we would expect that we'll invest more dollars after two quarters of sequential declines in infrastructure, we would expect to start spending more absolute dollars in infrastructure or our cost of revenue. Given the seasonality in revenue, we would expect to see some operating leverage against that line. So I think that's the financial interpretation of the returns that Bill was describing. In terms of the user question and what you're asking about in terms of seasonality, it's important to remember, the way we measure our users and report is a 30-day look back at the end of every quarter. And so in the second quarter this year, we'll look back across the month of June. That is the month where people tend to be out and about, and we've seen our seasonally softest quarter as a result of that in the second quarter. So typically, Q1 to Q2 users our MAU count has been seasonally our softest quarter. In addition to that, this year, we're making some product investments in a better user experience and leading the industry around privacy centres them with our user base. And that will moderate our year-over-year growth in our \u2013 so we have a company impact of \u2013 from a year-over-year perspective, some product investments that we think are good for our users over the long-term, coupled with a seasonally soft quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question. Yes. And Ross, on the question about U.S. Canada revenue growth, I would look back over a two year stack. And if you look at it on that basis, we had a little bit of a harder comp over a year ago period. So if you look at it over two years, we're pretty consistent at around 18%. However, within that, Bill talked about this at the outset around what we're seeing in pockets of our advertiser base. For those advertisers who have capital, who value positivity and brand safety, they value the insights-led selling that we can offer against the commercial intent of our users and who have adopted and see quality performance using our latest measurement solutions. We talked a lot about conversion API. We talked about clean room solutions. Those advertisers are performing exceptionally well, but you can look at the headlines and see that not everyone in retail is performing as well. So there is a mix of performance in some of these segments. And then on \u2013 Colin, on the expense guide, if you remember back, we've talked about this for a couple of quarters, we had a big increase in expenses last year that were largely payroll driven or headcount based. So in the first half of last year, we had a lot of attrition in the first quarter, we backfilled and accelerated hiring going into the end of Q2. And then as Bill referenced in his opening comments, we paused the rate of hiring in early Q3 and then that those efforts kind of accelerated as we moved into the end of last year and then through Q1. We also have called out historically that we had a lot of marketing spend that was variable in nature in the back half of last year that drove a lot of our expense growth in Q3 and Q4. We're lapping as a result of all of those comments. We're lapping the payroll expense growth as we go into Q3 and Q4. And then in the back half of the year, we're lapping a lot of variable marketing spend. The implication of all of that is that we will see a deceleration in year-over-year expense growth that will pick up next quarter and then accelerate going to Q3 and Q4, which will drive the margin improvement that we've been talking about now for a few quarters.  So I know the guide suggests that we'll see a step up in sequential expenses, a lot of that is timing around a couple of marketing programs and other investments that we're making, but we would not expect to see that continue to grow in absolute dollar terms, and certainly as a percentage of revenue, we would expect to see that decelerate dramatically over the course of especially the back half of the year. Doug, can you just repeat your second question?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thank you, Neil, and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Q1 was a strong quarter as we continue to deliver growth driven by foundational improvements in the core Pinterest experience and by continued focus on our strategic priorities and unique differentiators. We ended the quarter with 463 million monthly active users, up 7%. Furthermore, we accelerated growth among our global and UCAN or U.S. and Canada mobile app users similar to last quarter and our measures of engagement, including impressions, sessions and time spend continue to grow significantly faster than overall users, a testament to our work to deepen engagement per user. We generated revenue of $603 million, up approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. This strength came from the top and bottom of the funnel, including demand from our brand and performance objectives. As you saw in our press release, we announced a multiyear strategic third-party ad demand partnership with Amazon, which we believe can, over time, improve monetization with relevant ad content on the platform and increased shopability for users. I'll discuss this later in my remarks. While the overall demand environment remains challenging, we're demonstrating we can continue to grow our business while also operating with more efficiency. We delivered $27 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4% as our operating expenses came in lower than expected. This is due to a variety of cost reductions we achieved in the quarter as well as timing shifts that moved some expenses to Q2 and later in the year. Even with those timing shifts, we have confidence that the operational rigor we are driving in the business gives us a clear path to margin expansion in line with our prior commitments. This quarter, we continued to execute on our key strategic priorities, including: one, growing monetization and engagement per user; two, integrating shopping into the core of the product experience; three, improving operational rigor and therefore, margin expansion; and four, strengthening our leadership as a positive and brand-safe platform, including taking further steps to enhance the well-being of our users, especially teams. In Q1, we made solid progress in deepening engagement on the platform with our existing users. Users provide strong first-party signals to their actions on Pinterest, such as searching and browsing-related items as well as by saving pins on the curated boards that create product associations unique to our platform. This signal combined with our increasingly sophisticated AI models is driving improved relevancy and personalization for users. To that end, our mobile app users who are our most engaged and monetizable users and account for more than 80% of our total impressions and revenue grew 16% globally. U.S. and Canada mobile app user growth also accelerated to 7%, and our measures of engagement continued to grow faster than overall users, which is proof that users are coming back more frequently to Pinterest as they find more of what they're looking for on the platform. We continue to make good headway in adding new users, especially Gen Z users who grew double digits and continue to be our fastest growing demographic on the platform. Gen Z users are finding value in our positive and inspirational platform and are engaging with the full breadth of content including video. During the quarter, our video content on the platform grew nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter on top of the 30% sequential growth we drove in Q4. Furthermore, in March, we announced a new publisher deal with Dotdash Meredith, one of the largest publishers in America to bring video content to the platform across lifestyle, fashion, and food categories with brands including better homes and gardens, brides, food and wine, and all recipes. We're also finding that our blend of videos and images is resonating with users, as images remain a vital part of the Pinterest value proposition. Images in addition to video help users find inspiration relevant to them, refine what they're looking for and take action. Our corpus of images continues to grow even off a very large base, and we saw that that the number of boards grew double digits in Q1. The unique curation and depth of signal we drive speaks to the high intent of our audience and the lean forward experience we have on Pinterest. We're also improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full-funnel platform. At the top of the funnel, we're seeing strength and awareness objectives as we bring greater performance for advertisers. Also, our engagement wins are contributing to this growth by delivering more supply and favorable pricing. We've been hard at work building new ad formats that our brand advertisers have been asking for. In Q1, we began testing Premiere Spotlight, our first premium awareness offering to showcase brands in an exclusive placement on our search page with advertisers like the Coca-Cola company. Based on early testing results, Premiere Spotlight ads drive significantly higher click-through rates on average compared to standard video awareness ads on Pinterest. We also remain focused on lower funnel objectives where we believe we have a much larger opportunity to deliver convergence to advertisers looking for sales. We're doing this by growing supply, better matching that supply with relevant demand and innovating on formats actionability and measurement capabilities. In Q1, whole page optimization, which we introduced in the prior quarter continue to drive more relevant ad impressions with impressions growing faster than sessions, even as engagement improves. As a result, our ads marketplace is getting more efficient, contributing to an 8% reduction in CPAs for performance advertisers. We've also expanded our conversion ad products with mobile deep linking or MDL. We began beta testing MDL in Q3 of last year for shopping ads. And in Q1, MDL was the primary contributor to our shopping revenue growth, which was up 40% year-over-year. Building new ad tools and formats is only part of the equation for monetization success. The other part is helping advertisers measure those results through conversion visibility and attribution solutions. In Q1, we integrated our API for conversion with Tealium to drive further advertiser adoption, and we're in the process of onboarding advertisers like Wayfair onto our live ramp clean room solution in Q2. As I've discussed previously, I also believe there's a meaningful opportunity for us to augment our auction with third-party ad demand. This is an important lever for us to increase the comprehensiveness of our ads thereby leading to greater relevance and shopability for users and ultimately improve monetization on the platform. We believe Amazon is the right first partner as we bring third-party demand onto Pinterest because they offer a breadth of relevant shoppable ad content paired with a seamless consumer buying experience. Their broad coverage of brands and products will help accelerate our efforts to take users from inspiration to action, satisfying more of the commercial intent that users have on our platform. We're excited about this partnership and the value it can bring to users and advertisers. A partnership of this scale will be a multi-quarter implementation, and therefore it may not be until next year that we see more meaningful revenue impact. Moving to shopping. In Q1, we continue to execute on our vision to build the home of taste based shopping. Our survey work consistently shows that over 50% of users view Pinterest as a place to shop, and our long-term goal is to make every pin shoppable. In Q1, we started integrating Shoppable Pins, our products you can take action on to the home feed and improving the overall distribution of this content through investments in our core relevancy algorithm. These changes are showing promising results. Click-through rates and saves of Shoppable Pins grew over 35% year-on-year. We're also exploring new formats to make shopping more fun and engaging. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we were testing shoppable Shuffles on Pinterest with the goal of allowing users to more seamlessly access Shoppable Pins from their collages. As we started integrating more Shuffles content into the main Pinterest app, we're seeing the Shuffles with the highest number of saves have shoppable content like outfit, wedding, and home ideas. As we make products more easily discoverable and shoppable, we're also enhancing merchant value on the platform. In the last six months, we've seen nearly a 30% increase in attributed checkouts for merchants who upload their catalogs to the platform. As I've mentioned in past quarters, I believe our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities is enhanced by instilling a culture of operational rigor, including discipline management of expenses. We're not a growth at all cost company and our actions have proven that since I joined. Shortly after I arrived last summer, we took steps to significantly slow our pace of hiring. In Q3, we kept headcount flat and began driving meaningful improvement in infrastructure spend in Q4, while returning to user growth. In Q1, we took further actions to drive longer term efficiency in our business through our restructuring plan, which we announced at the end of March. As part of this restructuring, we reduced our real estate footprint by downsizing or completely closing several of our offices around the globe as our flexible work policies do not require our historical levels of capacity. In addition, we made a 4% reduction in our workforce in early February to better align our talent against our top strategic priorities. We remain committed to delivering meaningful margin expansion this year, even if the demand environment takes longer to improve. Todd will address this further in his remarks. As we grow users and engagement, we're also investing in making Pinterest a more positive place on the internet, which is important for our users and advertisers. For many of our users, Pinterest is a personal space online where they can discover, grow and manifest their dreams. Several third party studies have shown that users feel safer on Pinterest than other platforms, and they feel more positive when on Pinterest. We think that's worth investing in. To do that, we've taken steps to further enhance the safety and wellbeing of our users, especially minors. In late March, we made it mandatory for users to provide their birth dates so that we can provide age appropriate features and functionality. Pinterest is now private by default for existing and new users under the age of 16, and their content and profiles won't be discoverable by others studying a new bar for user wellbeing in this industry. Our investments in being a positive platform also make good business sense. As advertisers often side our positivity and brand safe environment as a reason for spending on the platform. Lastly, we're excited that Sabrina Ellis will be joining Pinterest as our Chief Product Officer. Sabrina is passionate about our mission to create a world where inspiration and wellbeing go hand in hand. I also want to thank Naveen Gavini for his 11 years of service and dedication to Pinterest. I'll now turn the call over to Todd to go into more detail on our quarter in guidance. I'm proud of our team's execution to deliver strong results in Q1. I'm confident that we're making the appropriate investments that will position us to gain share when the demand environment returns. Also, we're excited to share more about our progress and long-term strategy at our first Investor Day, which we're currently planning for September. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration. And with that, we can open up the call for questions. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the question. So first thing I'd say we feel really great about the quarter and the progress we've made on revenue. From everything we've seen, we continue to grow faster than the industry on revenue. So while there's still some challenge in the macro environment. When we look at our performance relative to the broader advertising industry, we feel really good about that. As we decompose, what's happening in our revenue, what we're seeing is that there's a lot to be really excited about in terms of those advertisers that are implementing our measurement solutions like conversion API and clean rooms consistently find that they're getting better performance from Pinterest than what they had previously understood. And as they see that, they double down and invest more in Pinterest. So as the industry goes through an adoption curve on privacy safe measurement solutions, we think that bodes quite well for Pinterest given the high intent on our platform and the way that we're leaning into better ad platform performance and seeing increasing engagement from our users so that there's great supply on the platform for those advertisers to connect with. In fact, I think that's one of the real highlights of the quarter is that not only have we clearly demonstrated our return to user growth. But as we've talked about before, there's sort of compounding layers there where our user growth being at 7% compares to our engagement growth that is solidly in the double digit range. And then our ad impressions aided by whole page optimization where we can bring dynamic ad load with greater relevance for users is north of 30% growth. And so there's multiple layers of growth there, and while the demand environment still has puts and takes in it. I think all that bodes really well for where we sit in the medium to long term. And in the near term, visibility remains a challenge and you have puts and takes, like for example, consumer spending and retail broadly for the whole retail industry down in February and March. It's a bit in my mind, premature to call an acceleration when you still have those kinds of things out there in the macro. But our relative performance, we've grown faster than others in the space. We feel like we continue to take share and what we hear from advertisers implementing our latest, best ad solutions, including things like conversion API and clean rooms, we perform really well and gain share of wallet as they've implemented those things. I think that's a very positive trend for us over the medium to long term, even though near term visibility, given the macro remains a challenge. I think on the second part of your question with regard to Amazon and the third party ad demand partnership there. As I've shared on prior calls, relative to the significant amount of commercial intent on Pinterest, I think we are a platform that is still under monetized relative to the amount of intent on the platform. And so, you see us, I mentioned driving a 30% plus increase in ad impressions on the platform even while driving up engagement. This shows as we bring more relevant ads onto the platform that is not only aiding our revenue growth, aiding advertiser value, it's good for users. And a commercial context ads can be great content. So coming back to the third party demand opportunity we see a significant opportunity to bring more relevant ads onto the platform from a greater breadth of brands and products. And when we look at Amazon as a first partner, they bring great breaths on brands and products paired with a really great consumer buying experience that we think can aid progress on shopability in our platform. Finally, I'll just say, back to your question of what's in our control. We've talked a lot about shopping on our platform, our early indicators of success on shopping. We could not feel better about as we have brought more shoppable content into our core surfaces. We've seen 30% plus increases in engagement on shoppable pins and 30% plus year-on-year increase in attributed checkouts for merchants who are uploading their catalogs to us. So, the question of can we take users from window shopping to taking action. We have very strong signs of progress there, and while that'll be a multi-year adoption curve, we couldn't feel better about the progress that we're making there. Thanks, Eric. Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. On the impact of next generation AI, it is here, you see it in our results. When we look at the significant progress we've made on user engagement that is largely driven by improvements we have made in personalization and relevancy for users and really applying NextGen AI techniques including things like GPUs but pairing those with the really unique signal on our platform. Again, I think I've shared a little bit of commentary about this in the past. I think the primitives of generative AI are going to be broadly accessible via cloud compute. I think we're going to be real differentiators are what are the places that have really unique signal upon which to train that AI? The AI is only as good as a signal upon which it's acting. And we have really unique first party signal not just around the intent of the user, but about things like product associations from the really unique activity that happens on our platform, like boards and curation that associates products together in ways that let us make really great conclusions through our AI training on those signals unique to our platform. So when you look at the improvements in user relevancy in the personalization there, there's a lot of work around AI that is driving those things. To your next part of the question around, the gross margin impacts and what does that mean? Yes, these things as measured on their own, can be \u2013 we can provide additional expense, but we also see them linking into greater revenue for us already as well. So, for example, using larger AI models and GPUs has been part of our progress in our ad stack. So a tangible example of that as we've been testing the deployment of significantly larger AI models for more relevant ads. Our CPC campaign saw a greater than 5% increase in click through rate. In the world of ad stack optimization, a 5% plus increase in click through rate is phenomenal. And so we're leaning heavily into that. It's been a core competency for us for a long time. So we're leaning heavily into that and applying it to and applying that to the unique signals on our platform. And last point, the shopability progress that we've been making there. I hit a few of these points already, but it's another place where AI's helping us a lot on those product recommendations and relevancy. And again, as we've started to bring shoppable content into the core of our product, into the main surfaces, we're seeing 35% \u2013 greater than 35% increase in engagement on shoppable pins. And we're seeing things like our shopping ad revenue continuing to grow 40% plus year-on-year improvements in the buying experience like mobile delinking being a significant driver of that 40% increase in shopping ad revenue. So again, the proof points of are the users \u2013 are the users not only going to window shop, but are they going to take action? Are they going to engage further really strong, really clear proof points on that. And NextGen AI is a big part of how we're powering those things behind the scenes, particularly when paired with the really unique signal on our platform. I'll give it Todd for the other part of your question. Thank you. Thanks, Ross. Appreciate the questions. So on the Amazon deal, I've pretty consistently commented that in a future state, we'd imagine that we would ingest third-party demand from multiple different parties, which I think is consistent with what you would see from most mature ad platforms out there that you have multiple sources of third-party demand augment in the auction. So without commenting on any other party, we chose Amazon as our first partner because we saw not only a really great opportunity to bring more brands and more products onto the platform, which we think can help comprehensiveness and shopability, but it's also paired with a really great consumer buying experience. I talked about the fantastic progress we're making in shopping overall as well as lower funnel \u2013 lower funnel objectives where we're driving strength there also with shopping and conversion objectives. So having a great consumer buying experience, we think really helps us take a step forward on our overall shopping efforts and is great for users, great for advertisers. So we felt like that was a key contributor to why Amazon is a great first partner for us. And in state, we'll have other partners. There is nothing that precludes us from that in the long term in the near term. We want to make sure we get this first partnership really right, as I shared it's going to be a multi quarter implementation. And so in the near-term, we'll be focused on making sure that we get that really right in the medium to long term. This is a broader move to leveraging third-party demand on the platform to enhance our comprehensiveness, our relevance for users and our shopability. And again, we feel great about this as a first step. You had some other detailed questions on the deal that might be a little bit more detailed and I can answer, but the overall \u2013 I think we feel great that there's fantastic mutual value in this for us and our partner, Amazon. And we think that can be the same for how we continue to work with other partners across the industry. So again, feel great about the progress there, not just in the partnership, but really what it means for users and bringing advertiser value onto our platform. Yes. Thanks for the question, Lloyd, so a lot to unpack there. So your macro \u2013 the macro point in your question, which is spot on, is that our platform \u2013 I talked about this before, our platform overall, it's a nascent \u2013 a more nascent ad platform. And relative to the very high consumer commercial intent on our platform, we're quite under monetized. And there's a real opportunity for us to simultaneously drive better user engagement through highly relevant ads that help users satisfy commercial intent while also driving up revenue on the platform. So you've seen that with like our whole page optimization and the fact that we're able to grow ad load 30% plus, while still having positive progress on engagement. This demonstrates that highly relevant ads that help the user satisfy their intent can be great content for the user and be enhancing both engagement and revenue simultaneously. So that's our macro opportunity. As you rightly called out, while we are under monetized overall, we are really under monetized internationally. And if you look at our results, you see really positive growth on a percentage basis internationally for us, which is evidence that there's a lot more potential there. And so that's something we're investing in directly with our first-party sales, but also something where we think partnerships can certainly be helpful in accelerating that progress. And so we think that overall, there's a significant opportunity to drive the monetization of our platform at a much greater rate than growth in not only users but also growth sort of engagement that we can drive monetization faster than that, particularly as we're demonstrating good results for advertisers, particularly as they implement new measurement tools, new privacy safe tools. So we feel like that is a significant opportunity for us and partnerships can definitely be helpful there. One other part \u2013 I think \u2013 sorry, one other part of your question I didn't answer. You asked about sort of teasing apart the nuances of Amazon. Like one thing in your question that again, I probably can't go into extremely nitty-gritty detail, but this is Amazon ads, not Amazon as a retailer. We certainly \u2013 you could have found lots of Amazon ads on our platform previously from Amazon as a retailer. This is Amazon ads. And so this is bringing ads from brands and other products that are leveraging the Amazon ad platform. That Amazon ad platform, one of the things that we're quite excited about is that it does also bring great buying experiences. And those buying experiences can include things for other brands and retailers. And so that is part of what is compelling about this partnership is that its \u2013 in an ad platform with a lot of brands, a lot of products that can help drive comprehensiveness for our users, but also paired with the great buying experience for the many retailers and brands that are participating in the Amazon ad platform. Thank you. Yes. To the last part of your question, yes. In \u2013 you're already seeing that happen where previously users \u2013 more than half of users said they were coming to Pinterest to shop. Pinterest was really solving digital window shopping, but the actionability was low. So it's sort of like Pinterest was solving digital window shopping, but the stores were closed. We are opening the stores. And the comments I made around the progress that we already have with shopping ads growing 40% year-on-year, mobile deep linking driving great conversion and being a big driver behind that growth. The 35% increase in engagement on Shoppable Pins, as we're bringing those onto our main surfaces, it's already the case that users are starting to find that much more of the things that they were finding on Pinterest before that they would've found on Pinterest, but couldn't take action on Pinterest, which was leaked engagement to other platforms and leaked monetization to other platforms, they're now able to take action on directly on Pinterest. And so our goal is to make every pins shoppable. That's a long-term goal that won't all get solved in a single year, but we feel really good about the progress that we're already making. And yes, we think this partnership absolutely can help contribute to that. As I said before, it's a multi-quarter implementation. And so I think we'll see more of that effect coming into next year. But separate from just the one partnership, just overall, we're already seeing your macro point of like will users see more actionability on the platform? They already are great progress on it. And as we get to this holiday shopping season, we would expect that users are going to be able to engage with much more of the shoppable content on Pinterest than what they would've previously. That's due to efforts that we already have in flight that are already in front of users and that we're growing aggressively. But it'll also be augmented by what we do with third-party partnerships like the one with Amazon. On your video point, so video continues to be north of 10% of our engagement. It's also the case that it continues to be a significantly greater percentage of our monetization. So this dynamic that we described last quarter, where last quarter I talked about, we've got 10% plus of our engagement on video, but 30% plus of our revenue, we continue to see that kind of dynamic. And your question about the interplay between video and images, we feel like we're finding a really great balance between those two things. We have a format that is bringing both videos and images to the user in a simultaneously versus those being separate surfaces. And as we're doing that, we're seeing that's resonating well with users, because again users come here with intent and with purpose, and sometimes that intent and purpose is aided by video, and they have the option to engage with that. But oftentimes as they want to go refine that intent, get closer to actionability images can help them a lot with that as well. And so we continue to work through that optimization, but we feel like we're getting that balance to a good place, and we're going to continue to lean into the balance of those two things, that that that gives the user the best of both world, because we see that users absolutely want both, and both those things helps the users drive more actionability. Last thing I'll say on video, I talked about how the video corpus is growing. Our image corpus continues to grow as well. The fact that our Boards are growing 10% plus is also a good indication of the core activities that user engage with on a platform. As we are leaning into those, those are not only alive and well, but things that users are engaging with more and more. And I talked about Gen Z, as our fastest growing demographic. They're also \u2013 Gen Z is the fastest growing demographic is not just about a big growth rate on a small denominator. Gen Z is a \u2013 is the largest contributor of engagement growth as we talk about engagement growth. So we \u2013 to put it very pointedly, we are winning with Gen Z. And I think this was a big question about the platform a year ago. We've returned to user growth. We're clearly winning with Gen Z and winning with Gen Z in a unique way where we don't need to win with them on where they go for entertainment. We're winning with them on where they go when they have intent and purpose and where they go when they're looking for an oasis away from the toxicity of the rest of social media. And that's working quite well for us, including how we're leaning into more investments in their wellbeing on our platform. Yes. We are very focused on what gives the user the best satisfaction of their intent and their purpose. And what we're finding with that is that's a balance of video and images, and you can expect us to continue progressing that in a thoughtful methodical way that helps the user satisfy their intent. And in a way, a big contrast from us with other platforms, most other platforms are talking about video as a headwind to revenue. And you're hearing us talk about video is helping to drive engagement, but we have more revenue on video than we have on engagement. So that's sort of the inverse of what you'd see on other platforms. We think we can continue to manage it in that kind of fashion. Hopefully that helps. Yes. On the international side, I'd say, first thing is back to the user point, what we are doing to deliver great engagement for users is working well across geography. So our return to user growth is happening across geographies both [indiscernible] and international. And so in terms of our platform returning to user growth and bringing more supply onto the platform that's consistent across geographies, we feel great about that. I think your point on monetization, we are a fraction of the monetization that we could be internationally. And particularly when you look at places like Europe that there's clear line of sight to how there's more monetization opportunity in places like Europe. Our growth rates, you can see the growth rates there are high, but the denominators are low. And we think that's a lot of go forward potential with us. But those high growth rates even on a small denominator, I think are the good indications of as we build out those investments, as we build out our ad capabilities in those international markets. Our sales teams are able to go make effective progress there. And we think there's a lot more of that to come. Finally on international, we called out large advertisers are growing with us there, and we have SMB growth and international as well. So a good balanced mix of where we think there's opportunity in international for us. Yes. So I think on sort of what we're seeing on the macro, as I shared before, there's a lot that we feel great about, but there are puts and takes out there. I think as in \u2013 the fact that we're growing revenue faster than the broader industry, I think is something that \u2013 we certainly feel great about. That's hard fought. But we feel great that we're growing revenue faster than the industry. And we have \u2013 as I shared earlier, the number of things that give us confidence that we're demonstrating good value for advertisers, even as those advertisers are digesting a lot of change. I think as compare us to others, I think there are places that maybe that are strengths for us, that are strengths for others, like international, small business and international, those kinds of things. But those are a smaller portion of our overall business. But you do see those accelerating for us as well. They're just a smaller portion of our overall business. But when you look at multiple major platforms still having year-on-year declines, and we're putting up solid growth, and we feel like we've got \u2013 even though, visibility is limited, we feel like we've got visibility to continue growth even as other larger platforms some of which are still seeing year-on-year declines. I think that's good indication of our relative performance, and I don't see that changing. We just see that visibility is limited and it feels premature to call a bottom, when you have things like consumer spending on retail still declining year-on-year. So our view of the medium and long-term, we could not feel better about. In fact, if I go back to our strategic priorities and where we were a year ago, as Todd mentioned in his script, a year ago, we'd had multiple quarters of year-on-year decline with users. We were a supply constrained platform. Advertiser value was in question, because that \u2013 the supply constraints where we sit today, we have return to user growth. We are clearly growing with Gen Z as our fastest growing demographic. We're delivering great value for advertisers. And the more advertisers implement better measurement, the more they see that we're delivering value for them. Shopping on the platform that was a real question a year ago of like, could we drive more shopping behavior, very strong proof points on that, even though we're early on in adoption curve. All those things on every one of our strategic comparatives, we've executed and I think our, beyond the progress we would have expected and with add impressions up 30% plus, had demand been constant, the growth will be screaming, right? But we can't predict when demand volatility sort of goes back to normal better than anybody else. And there continue to be a lot of puts and takes, and I think you see that reflected in others commentary with they're also calling either experiencing year-on-your declines or calling that visibility is still poor for them as well as evidenced by wide ranges and outcomes and those kinds of things. Yes. I think, we are looking at this \u2013 with generative AI, we think there's a lot we can do to deliver better experiences in ways that the user that will feel natural for the user. And I think that's what you're seeing from us already, that we're using next generation AI to bring better recommendations, more shopability, better product experiences, ads that are more relevant and convert better. So you're already seeing that in the platform. So we're thinking about ways that we can bring next generation AI to users in a way that feels natural to them. And given that we're a highly visual platform, we think we'll have a lot more of those kinds of opportunities around great recommendations, users making collages on shuffles. There's a lot of great AI that's behind the way that we're doing those kinds of things. So there's a lot of that kind of stuff that you already are seeing from us, where we're going to be methodical about it. There's still a lot of open questions out there around how do you make sure there's good value exchange between platforms and publishers? How do you make sure that there are image rights and all these kinds of things that are \u2013 these are meaningful issues that we're going to be thoughtful and methodical about and we're not going to rush into sort of head first. But we're finding really great ways to leverage this technology that's already driving user benefits, and you can expect to see more of that from us. So on your second question around the team, feel great about the team that we have. This is a team that's winning. This is a team that's delivering great results. And you've seen us, doing that consistently over the last three quarters. And so these things are oftentimes relay races. And so even in places where we've had somebody who's led a strong leg of the race, we've brought in great talent to augment the next leg of the race. And so if part of your question there was around, our CFO transition, I'd say, it's a good opportunity for what I was already planning to do, which is to thank Todd again for having ran a really strong leg of the race probably a couple legs of the race given how long he's been here and how thoughtful he's been in the transition. And so while we don't have new news to share there right now, we've seen exceptional engagement from a number of candidates and we feel quite confident that process is progressing on track, both in terms of how thoughtful and engaged Todd has been in managing that transition, as well as our ability to make sure that we're going to have great talent going forward there as well. Sabrina, who I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, I think he is going to be a fantastic addition to the team, even as we also say thank you to Naveen, who also ran multiple really strong legs of the race for us as well. So that part we feel great about. And so on the mobile part of it, to the first part of your question, again, another really positive part of our progress, as I shared, 80% plus of our engagement and revenue comes from mobile app users. And those mobile app users both in [indiscernible] and international, growing much faster for us than users overall. So our most engaged users are growing the fastest, and that's giving us the opportunity to have greater depths of engagement. So the progress on mobile feels great. Without commenting on sort of future product announcements for those kinds of things, having the user in our mobile app, lets us control our destiny much more. And we feel fantastic about the progress there and what that lets us do to drive deeper and deeper engagement for users and deliver greater value for advertisers. So with that, again, thank you everybody for the questions. Thank you again, Todd. Since this is the last earnings call. Thank you again for a fantastic tenure here at Pinterest. Very much appreciate the partnership. Thank you to everyone on the call. Thank you to all our customers, our team members and we look forward to continuing conversation with all of you. Thank you,"

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. One year ago at our Investor Day, we shared our business vision and outlined the strategic initiatives that we believe will drive long-term sustainable growth. These initiatives include; one, growing users and deepening engagement per user; two, making ads relevant content, which allows us to increase ad load and provide a better user experience simultaneously; three, executing on our lower funnel revenue opportunity; and finally, driving demand through third-party partners, resellers, and international markets as additional levers to growth. We stated that these initiatives, working in tandem, would result in a mid to high-teens revenue growth CAGR and improving profitability, leading to adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to the low 30% range in the next three to five years. One year later, our operating results validate our continued execution against this strategy and commitment to delivering on the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. When we announced our three to five-year financial targets at Investor Day, we had just delivered Q2, 2023 revenue growth of 6%. Since then, on a trailing 12-month basis, as of Q3 2024, we have accelerated revenue growth to 18% and expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Q3 was further evidence of progress against our strategy. As we grew revenue 18% year-over-year, we built out a full funnel ads platform with a particular focus on the lower funnel, which continues to be the fastest growing part of our business as advertisers are increasingly seeing Pinterest as a great place to connect with customers, demonstrating high commercial intent. We're also building a fundamentally better product, focusing on the aspects of Pinterest that make us unique to our audience, the ability to find inspiration, curate, and shop all in one place. We are pleased to report monthly active users of 537 million in Q3, another record high, reflecting 11 % year-over-year growth. Each quarter of record users provides further evidence that we found our best product market fit in years. Today, I'll focus my remarks on discussing themes that are driving progress against the strategy we laid out at Investor Day, starting with an overview about AI and its impact across our business, and moving on to a more specific quarterly update on users, engagement, and monetization. At Pinterest, AI is a core competency and has played a central role in how we have transformed our business over the last two plus years for both our users and advertisers. As we've leaned into this important technology in recent years, we've generated substantial returns from our investments that have fueled growth across our business. Effectively, all content served on Pinterest, including organic and ads, is powered by AI recommendation models that are trained by our unique first-party signal, and AI is only as good as the signal it acts upon. Our AI models generate over 400 million predictions per second, ranking what our users might engage with every time they come to the platform. These rankings leverage hundreds of billions of user actions like searches, saves, and clicks that come from over 0.5 billion logged-in users who are actively exploring, curating, and refining their tastes. This vast data allows us to create highly personalized and relevant recommendations, introducing audiences to new brands, products, and emerging trends. We have distinctive and explicit expressions of intent, like a user searching for and saving outfits to their vacation board. This provides us with real-time insight into what inspires our users and what they're looking to purchase next and provides a holistic understanding of user taste based on their past behavior and other users with similar taste. So, while other platforms may see what their users are looking to purchase today, we see what users are interested in purchasing days, weeks, and even months in advance. This is because the users who come to Pinterest are often undecided, but refine their tastes over multi-session commercial journeys before ultimately deciding what to do or buy. This signal creates a flywheel effect. As users engage with our recommended content through curation actions like saving to boards and creating collages or through clicking and buying behavior, we gather richer data. Incorporating this data into our recommendation algorithms enables us to deliver even more personalized and relevant content, and create a network of product associations unlike any other platform that allows us to effectively recommend content to users with similar tastes. Furthermore, in addition to utilizing our proprietary foundation models in areas where we are differentiated, such as computer vision, we are also leveraging our unique first-party signal to fine tune off-the-shelf large language models for a variety of use cases around organic and ad content serving. This approach has led to phenomenal results, notably a 300-basis point improvement in actionable engagement measured by clicks and saves compared to using an off-the-shelf model not fine-tuned with our data. Our unique user signals and deep understanding of individual interests and tastes also allow us to power monetization with highly relevant ads, making the ad useful content for users. We see this clearly across the platform, including on our search surface, where the average ad's relevance for top ad slots has more than doubled over the past two years. This means when a user searches for commercial queries like, Holiday Home Decor or Fall Boots, they see more ads that are relevant to their query that they can easily shop. Since our users come with commercial intent, these ads do not interrupt their user journey, rather, they enhance it. We also leveraged AI to significantly enhance our ads ranking and delivery systems over the past 18 months, leading to compounding efficiency gains for our advertisers across the platform. Additionally, in moments of high intent, our AI powered whole-page optimization enabled us to flex up ad load to serve more relevant ads to our users, allowing ad load and engagement to grow in tandem. All in all, AI is a core competency at Pinterest and at the center of the significant progress we're making across our technology stack, which is enhancing the experience for users and advertisers alike. With that, let's get into Q3 specifically and discuss our work to grow users and deepen engagement. In Q3, we continued to improve the user inspiration-to-action journey. As a visual search and discovery platform, users come to Pinterest to explore their interests, seek inspiration, and browse items they may like to purchase. They curate and save pins into boards and collages, refining their taste and facilitating future shopping. We've enhanced the actionability of our platform by integrating shopability into all major user experiences and leveraging our computer vision technology to make pins easily shoppable. Users are taking notice of this change, with 66% of weekly Gen Z Pinners saying Pinterest is the first or one of the first services they use to shop, up from 54% the year prior. Through curation, we gain valuable insights into product context, enabling us to refine our recommendations and enhance the user experience. Boards and collages are integral to allowing users to curate their taste on Pinterest, and we continue to make steady investments to improve these features. For example, we recently launched a suite of new collage features, including Collage Remixing, which lets users collaborate, build upon, and use existing collages as a starting point to express their own taste and creativity, thereby reducing the barrier to entry to create a collage. We're also bringing shoppable recommendations to boards, utilizing context from users' own search and save history, as well as our unique product associations to recommend items that might match their taste and allow them to seamlessly move down the funnel from curation to action. At Investor Day, we also discussed the shifts we made to our shopping strategy, most notably shifting from a model that was trying to compete with retailers for the transaction to being an ad-based model that is a deep partner to retailers. Our go-forward strategy is centered on expanding shoppable content, refining recommendations through improved personalization and relevance, and seamlessly connecting users and merchants. Over the past year, we have made significant progress in executing against this strategy, with the goal of making our platform more actionable for users. Notably, for the fourth consecutive quarter, we more than doubled outbound clicks to advertisers year-over-year as we improved the overall actionability of the platform. Additionally, to improve user understanding of which pins are shoppable, we've added visual shopping indicators to product pins in the US and launched filters like On Sale to help users find products that match their budget and preferences. Finally, we're expanding the availability of our shopping features to a broader audience. We recently expanded Shop the Look, which helps users shop what they see in lifestyle imagery to international markets. We also added Ways 2 Style, a module that appears on close-ups for women's fashion pins, showcasing inspiration on how to style the item in an outfit and complementary shoppable products from our catalog. In summary, we are successfully executing a strategy we shared at our Investor Day to drive curation and actionability. As a result, we are seeing steady improvement across the basket of engagement metrics we measure, including the ratio of our weekly active to monthly active users, as well as an exciting increase in the mix of user sessions that include actionability, like curation and outbound clicks. This increasing mix of intent-based and lower-funnel user actions is directly aligned with our efforts to make Pinterest more shoppable for users and a true full-funnel platform for advertisers as well. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by increasing Pinterest's value and performance for advertisers. We delivered strong revenue growth in Q3, up 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in our lower-funnel revenue for the third quarter in a row. As we've discussed before, we've been in the process of transforming our advertising product to be a true performance platform where advertisers can meet our users across the purchase funnel. While shopping has long been a core use cases on Pinterest, advertisers historically lack the tools to effectively drive and measure performance on Pinterest. To address this, we've rolled out multiple lower-funnel products over the past 18 months, all of which compound on each other and become more powerful when used together. Our multi-quarter lower-funnel product rollout began in earnest with tools to drive more seamless handoffs. In mid-2023, we launched Mobile Deep Linking, enabling a one-click transition to an advertiser's mobile application, particularly beneficial for large retailers with deep consumer penetration of their mobile app. We followed this offering with the release of Direct Links, our one-click handoff to an advertiser's mobile or desktop website from Pinterest. Combined, MDL and Direct Links cover 100% of our lower-funnel revenue today and have significantly improved both the shopping experience on Pinterest and advertiser performance. With Q3 being the fourth consecutive quarter, we've more than doubled the clicks to advertisers year-over-year. The success of these tools is evident in our strong lower-funnel revenue growth over the last three quarters, as advertisers increasingly allocate budget to us after seeing performance gains on our platform. We initially began to see value capture in the form of increasing budget allocation from our largest, most sophisticated advertisers who benefited from Mobile Deep Linking and leveraged advanced measurement tools to understand the increase in ROI we were driving. With some of these large advertisers, we've reached more than 5% of their total ad budgets or 10% plus of their digital ad budgets. While Pinterest was traditionally limited to smaller experimental budget pools, we are now taking share in performance budgets that tend to be larger and always on. For the past three quarters, as more advertisers have implemented measurement tools to see the impact of Direct Links, we've started to see the next tranche of large retailers, those in the $1 billion to $30 billion sales range, follow suit and increase their spend. With both of these advertiser segments, we see more headroom to grow share of wallet into 2025 and beyond as advertisers see increasing gains to their lower funnel campaigns through the continued benefits of MDL, Direct Links, shopping ads, and resilient measurement. We also expect our new automation offering, Performance+, to propel an even greater portion of spend from these advertisers as we make campaigns easier to create and more performant. Compounding on the lower funnel improvements we've rolled out over the past 18 months. Diving deeper into automation, after months of beta testing, we officially launched Performance+ for general availability on October 1st. Performance+ brings together AI-driven budgeting, bidding, and targeting functionalities while reducing the effort required from advertisers. Recognizing that giving up control can be challenging for certain marketers, we've gone through multiple levels of alpha and beta testing to validate the effectiveness of automated campaigns in simplifying the experience for marketers and delivering superior ROI. The results are clear, advertisers need 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign, and on average, see a 10% better cost per action. Moreover, advertisers who use Performance+ for their shopping ad campaigns, on average, see a 20% plus cost per action improvement. While we're only five weeks into the general availability launch of Performance+ campaigns, we're pleased with the early signals from advertisers as they begin to adopt the automation suite. This is especially true for the smaller and medium-sized advertisers who have historically struggled to build successful campaigns on Pinterest. Beyond its initial suite of automation tools, Performance+ is expanding to include new creative and bidding features. Performance+ Creative, which also went into general availability in early October, helps advertisers create and optimize their ad creatives across formats, including Generative AI backgrounds on shopping ads. Beta testing has demonstrated a 14% average increase in conversion rate and a 9% lower cost per action for advertisers utilizing Performance+ Creative. For example, Ruggable, an online retailer known for its innovative washable rugs, used Performance+ Creative to automate ad creation from their extensive product catalog. In addition to the significant time and effort savings from automation, they drove a 37% better click-through rate compared to their standard shopping campaigns. Our second key investment area is bidding, with features designed to enable advertisers to bring more inventory onto Pinterest and find value across a broader swath of their catalog. For the largest advertisers, we built in the optionality to bid at the item level of their product catalog, so advertisers can have more granular controls to bid at different price points. For the next tier of advertisers, we introduced Performance+ ROAS bidding, which automatically optimizes bids based on performance or customer value in order to maximize return on ad spend. While ROAS bidding is currently in beta, in our alpha test, most advertisers saw at least a 15% increase in return on ad spend by using Performance+ ROAS bidding. We expect Performance+ ROAS bidding to exit beta testing and be more broadly available to all eligible advertisers in Q1. Underlying our lower funnel improvements are our efforts to implement our resilient measurement solutions. Conversions API, or CAPI, remains our highest priority within the suite of measurement solutions, as it enhances conversion visibility for advertisers and, in turn, can be used to tune and optimize their spend for future performance. We increased our CAPI coverage again this quarter and also introduced CAPI Connect, a lower-touch adoption method for advertisers with fewer in-house developing resources, to further simplify the process. We are also promoting the adoption of other resilient solutions, depending on an advertiser's preference. For example, many of our large retail partners have implemented clean rooms with us to improve their conversion visibility and measurement models. By providing a wider range of durable measurement solutions, we are aligning with advertisers' needs and meeting them where they are. As a result, advertisers utilizing one or more of our privacy-centric measurement tools now make up over half our total revenue, or two-thirds of our lower funnel revenue specifically. We continue to make progress across the lower funnel suite, one of our key investment areas in the business, and look forward to sharing more progress in the quarters to come as this suite of solutions continues to roll out. Next, I'll touch on our global partnership efforts, which are meant to fill in gaps in our auction and expand our international presence. We've made great progress since we discussed these partnerships at our Investor Day a year ago. Starting with our third-party demand partnerships, we announced in September that as a start to our international expansion, we expanded our relationship with Amazon Ads from the U.S. to now include Canada and Mexico as well. Next, our Google partnership continues to grow as we test, learn, and expand to new regions, including both under-monetized and previously un-monetized markets. Both of these partnerships have continued to build sequentially throughout the year, and we expect that trajectory to persist into Q4. Turning to our reseller partnerships. Throughout this year, we have turned on multiple new partnerships to expand our sales coverage across our international footprint. Resellers complement our first-party sales efforts and our third-party demand partnerships and are now helping to drive revenue in over 30 under-monetized markets. We expect these partnerships to ramp in our rest-of-world markets in a steady progression throughout the next few quarters. Finally, with the holiday season right around the corner, I'd be remiss not to discuss some of our most exciting launches to help users shop and help advertisers drive sales during the most important retail period of the year. For users, we're taking the work out of holiday shopping by introducing Gift Guides, curated by celebrities, brands, publishers, and tastemakers, with shoppable gift ideas available to users right in their feed. For advertisers, we've launched a suite of new tools powered by machine learning to better help advertisers highlight their holiday shopping discounts. The first tool is Promotions, which allows advertisers to showcase promotions like free shipping, site-wide sales, and buy one, get one offers to users based on their taste and preferences. The test results have been promising. For example, Spanx was an early adopter of our new promotions feature and saw a 2x increase in click-through rate on their recent campaign. Second, we launched new deal ad modules, making ads with special offers more visible to users with the carousel format, helping brands stand out during sale moments. These enhancements help users easily find that perfect gift they've been looking for and helping advertisers connect with our high intent user base. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making across a number of initiatives, many of which were in the early stages of development at our Investor Day a year ago. And I'm even more optimistic about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance.\nJulia Donnelly : Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our third quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary fourth quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Let's start with our third quarter results. We ended the quarter with 537 million global monthly active users, or MAUs, growing 11% and reaching yet another record high. Additionally, we continued to demonstrate user growth across all our reported geographies. In Q3, our US and Canada region had 99 million MAUs, growing 3%. Our Europe region had 139 million MAUs, growing 8%. And in the rest of world markets, we had 300 million MAUs, growing 16%. Moving to revenue, in Q3, our global revenue was $898 million, up 18% on a reported and constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel, with strength coming from our lower funnel consideration and conversion objectives, which optimize for clicks and conversions. From a vertical perspective, we continued to see broad strength in retail. Additionally, emerging verticals, like financial services, automobiles, and technology, continue to be a source of strength. However, this growth was partially offset by ongoing softness within the food and beverage subsector of CPG, where advertisers continue to navigate broader industry headwinds. Next, as expected, revenue from our third party demand partnerships continue to ramp in Q3, growing sequentially off the revenue base we delivered in Q2, as it continues to complement our growing first party business. Turning to our geographical breakouts for Q3. In the US and Canada, we generated $719 million in revenue, growing 16%. Strength came from retail and emerging categories, including financial services, technology, and automobiles. In Europe, revenue was $137 million, growing 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in Europe was driven by retail. Revenue from rest of world was $42 million, growing 38% on a reported basis, or 45% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, ad impressions grew 41%, while ad pricing declined 17% year-over-year. Our efforts to begin serving ads and monetize international markets or previous gaps in our auction have been accretive to net revenue. However, as we started to call out last quarter, the ramp of these initiatives has also naturally led to an increase in ad impressions growth and downward pressure on overall global platform pricing due to this ongoing mix shift. Moving to expenses. Though year-over-year comparisons are becoming more challenging due to the substantial margin expansion achieved in the second half of 2023, we continue to drive adjusted EBITDA margin expansion again in Q3 through effective expense discipline while also allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. In Q3, cost of revenue was $182 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 1% versus Q2 due to increased infrastructure spend related to user and engagement growth partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $478 million, up 15%. The increase was primarily due to R&D, where we are investing in headcount growth with smaller increases in sales and marketing and G&A. Our revenue strength and expense discipline led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA coming in at $242 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27%. This was up approximately 280 basis points versus Q3 last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.4 billion. In the quarter, we allocated $466 million towards share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date spend to $500 million for a total of 15.9 million shares. In addition, we have utilized $306 million of cash year-to-date on net share settlement of equity awards. Lastly, we have replenished our buyback capacity by authorizing a new $2 billion share repurchase program intended to be used over a multiyear period to mitigate dilution from stock-based compensation or opportunistically buyback shares. Now I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.145 billion, representing 15% to 17% growth year-over-year. Based on current spot rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange to be minimal. Turning now to our expense guidance, we expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $495 million to $510 million, growing 11% to 14% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we anticipate a more modest level of year-over-year Q4 non-GAAP cost of revenue leverage versus the prior three quarters as we anniversary significant gains from our cost optimization work. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we continue to invest in headcount for AI talent and other product initiatives supporting users and monetization. Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in both halves of 2024, to at a more modest level in the second half as we anniversary the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in 2024 towards our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin targets. In closing, I'm pleased with our team's performance this quarter, which demonstrates ongoing progress against our strategic plans as we grow users and engagement and continue to strengthen our full-funnel offering for advertisers. With that, I'll hand it over to Bill for some final words.\nBill Ready : Thanks, Julia. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. You have the first question on the phone lines from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just starting with a macro. Julia, your guide for 4Q looks like a couple-point decel at the midpoint. Could you just talk about what you're seeing quarter-to-date? Any impact from the shortened holiday window, or any kind of category strength or weakness that we would flag here? And then just, generally how are things heading into 2025? Thanks a lot.\nJulia Donnelly : Thanks, Ross. So as you noted, we're guiding Q4 at 15% to 17%, which is roughly similar to the 16% to 18% we guided for Q3. And obviously, we came in at the high end of that range in Q3 at 18%. And that guidance for Q4 reflects the continuation of many of the factors that helped drive our growth in Q3 and really throughout this entire year. Lower funnel revenue growth has been the fastest growing part of our business for the past three quarters, driven by the product innovation we've had over the last 18 months. And we expect that lower funnel strength to continue not just into Q4, but into 2025 and beyond. Revenue from third party demand partnerships also continues to ramp sequentially into Q4. However, we've also noted for the last few quarters that we're seeing softness among food and beverage advertisers who are navigating broader headwinds within that category. And we think this trend continues into Q4 as well. I would also call out that as expected, Performance+ is still in the early rollout phase, with many advertisers limiting budget shifts and adoption of new features during holiday peak period. We also have more functionality on the come with Performance+, with ROAS bidding feature expected to be released in Q1 next year, which is consistent with our prior commentary on the timeline. And just like our previous lower funnel product efforts like MDL, Direct Links, and CAPI, we expect the adoption curve and value capture cycle to be multi-quarter, beginning in 2025, and to further compound the gains we are seeing in the lower funnel.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is, can you \u2013 Bill, can you sort of walk us through, just kind of step back and say, your most important 2025 ad innovation focal points, and perhaps how have new Gen AI capabilities sort of changed those over the course of the last year? And then the second one, I'll do a jump off either Bill or Julia. As you sort of think about the ad tech innovation areas, are there any where you really see the potential to just drive durably faster ad revenue growth, sort of hopping into the 20\u2019s or is it just sort of, it's more of a challenge to add that many dollars? Thanks.\nBill Ready: Thanks Brian. So, first of all, we feel really good about the levers we have to drive new growth in 2025 as we make further continued progress in building out the full funnel platform with a concerted focus on the lower funnel. If we look back at the initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day, those all continue to play out nicely. As I noted, we rolled out a number of lower funnel tools and solutions like mobile deep linking, Direct Links, and CAPI, privacy-resilient measurement. They are leading to the increased share of wallet and value capture especially with our largest, most sophisticated advertisers and now increasingly with the next tranche of advertisers as well. So we see more room to grow with both cohorts of advertisers in 2025. And it's worth noting, that for some of our largest advertisers, lower funnel revenue objectives now account for over 80% of their spend with us, which is up significantly over the last two years and significantly higher than the overall mix of lower funnel that we see across the business. A couple of things to note, Performance+ just went GA with value capture still on to come as you go into 2025, especially for mid-sized accounts as Performance+ really helps automate and expedite new campaign creation. And then of course, global partnerships, including third-party demand, resellers, are also an added contributor as we look into 2025. And then, as we've noted on the last several quarters, macro headwinds specifically within the food and beverage category are not unique to us, but we do have more concentration there, and those are somewhat out of our control. So setting those aside, we continue to feel good about our initiatives to grow the business into 2025 and beyond. And it\u2019s worth noting, you asked about \u2013 in your second question of getting to growth in the 20\u2019s. If you excluded food and beverage, we grew revenue in the low 20% range in Q3, which really speaks to the strength and the rest of the business on the back of the initiatives that we're driving. And so you talked about durability, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we're moving into those lower funnel performance budgets, those tend to be much larger than the experimental budgets where we played before, and much more durable, and that is increasingly where we are gaining share, so that we feel really good about. And again, if you were to exclude food and beverage where there's been a broader macro headwind, and we just have a little more exposure to that, because of the unique use cases on our platform, the rest of our business growing in the low 20% range in Q3. And then finally on engagement, we continue to be excited with the progress there. We're seeing an increasing mix of sessions that include lower funnel actions, and that's really directly aligned with our efforts to improve actionability. And we have more room to go as monetization per unit of intent is still a fraction of what it could be on the platform, but we've really proven out that Pinterest is a shopping platform. And we've talked about winning with the next generation, with Gen Z. Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop. That's increasing the case year-over-year, as I shared in my prepared remarks, and we see that across the platform. And so again, that's why we feel good about picking up share in those lower funnel objectives, performance budgets, retail being a source of strength. Those are all things that have been consistently part of our story, and those efforts continue to compound on one another. Hopefully that helps.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nKen Gawrelski : Thank you very much for the opportunity. On Performance+, could you talk to us about, I know you just rolled out in GA, but could you talk about how we should think about the contribution to \u201825 growth? And over time, do you think that it builds throughout the year, or how do you see clients adopting Performance+ and its contribution in \u201825? And then maybe to follow-up just on the same matter, do you see this as driving greater advertiser adoption or do you see it driving better conversions, and therefore better pricing on an impression level that has already been expanding pretty dramatically? I know it could have both impacts, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on one versus the other. Thank you.\nBill Ready: Yeah, thanks for the question Ken. So we're feeling really good about the rollout of Performance+. As you noted, and I noted in my prepared remarks, that went to general availability just at the beginning of October. So we saw really encouraging results from the beta testing and from our early deployment of that, but it is early, and these are always multi-quarter adoption cycles. And I called out in my prepared remarks that a year ago at our Investor Day, we had just printed 6% revenue growth in the quarter before our Investor Day. A year later, we've done 18% revenue growth on a trailing 12-month basis. That's really because the things that we had launched then, Direct Links, mobile deep linking, those early shopping efforts, those paid compounding dividends over the coming year. And we think about Performance+ similarly, that as we go into next year, that that gives us a next leg of budget gains that we can make with advertisers. And some of the stats I called out, those initial results, we're seeing 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign. So to your question about getting to more clients, that really helps us get to those sort of mid-size on down advertisers, where setting up campaigns, finding performance had been a struggle for them. 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign, and a 20% plus CPA improvement for those. So that's going really well in terms of the performance that we're delivering and the reduction in effort, which should get us to a wired swath of advertisers. The creative side of that, I mentioned the Ruggable Case Study on the call. As we're doing AI-generated creative that makes products appear more visually compelling for users, we're seeing really great results there in the Ruggable Case Study, 37% better click-through rate using Performance+ Creative compared to their standard shopping campaigns. So that gives you a sense of just how significant the benefits are, so a lot more to come on that in 2025. Your question about, so I addressed expanding to more advertisers, where we're going from those very largest event, really picking up steam for some time with us now, to the next sort of $1 billion to $30 billion group. Performance+ campaign creation gets us more of those advertisers. But the other part of your question of like, can we get to more of their inventory, more of the advertiser's inventory? And so this gets to how we grow share of wallet, even for our largest advertisers. Things that we've done like SKU level bidding and ROAS bidding, these help the advertiser bid at a more granular level, and see performance across a much wider swath of their inventory, which should bring more advertised inventory onto the platform, and be another source of expansion as we go into next year. So that Performance+ ROAS bidding that I mentioned, that's still in beta with encouraging results and general availability on that to come in Q1. So both those things, all those things together really give us confidence that there's a lot more share of wallet that we can gain. And that's all at the back of the inherent commerciality of our users. Again, we've really proven out Pinterest as a great place to shop. So its early days, but we're really encouraged by what we're seeing there, given the strong performance among the beta advertisers, and we do see incrementality there and early signs of budget shift. So while that broader adoption is more H1, the signs there are encouraging, even though advertisers don't make big shifts during the holiday shopping season.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Ron Josey with Citigroup.\nRon Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wanted to follow-up on that question just now around engagement, but specifically you mentioned we're proven out, Pinterest is a great place to shop. So would love your thoughts on this engagement rates on the platform. Aside from MOUs, but just engagement rates around shoppable engagement, and as you think about the benefits from AI, would you say we're in the early days here, that 300 basis points? And then a second question just on the lower funnel products and adoption. With Outbound Click continuing to double here, help us understand just the process of adoption of these tools like Direct Links and CAPI. Does it usually take two or three quarters or how did advertisers see this in terms of adoption, now that we're several quarters in the launch? Thank you.\nBill Ready:  Yeah, thanks Ron. So, on the engagement question, just to be really crystal clear about this, the significant improvement in user growth and DPA engagement has been a bright spot over the past two years. Those trends continue to be really encouraging as we continue to deepen engagement, while also reaching record high monthly active users. A place you can see that really clearly is in the steady improvement in our WAU to MAU ratio in 2024, even as we bring in record amounts of new users. Oftentimes, bringing in a lot of new users can be dilutive to your engagement per user. But even as we bring on record amounts of new users, our WAU to MAU ratio continues to see steady improvement, which just really gets to how we're driving depth of engagement and how as we bring more relevant shoppable content, including ads, onto the platform, that's driving further user engagement. When you unpack what's driving engagement across the back of activities that we look at, we see that actionability, specifically sessions with curation and clicks, are driving an increasing share of engagement. That's really encouraging as it aligns with the shift of our business model toward the lower funnel and is a higher value activity, both for the user and the advertiser, compared to passive view time alone. So that's really encouraging. And finally, our most mature markets are our most engaged, with engagement per MAU being highest in UCAN, and continuing to grow, and that's consistent with our other developed markets. So we're furthest along in our actionability efforts in these mature markets, but lots of opportunity as we take that further internationally. But these things do continue to build upon themselves. And so you were asking about lower funnel adoption. As we've called out many times, these things are multi-quarter adoption cycles for retailers. But it's also worth noting that, in addition to the multi-quarter adoption cycle, you see compounding benefits to these things. So we've talked about the flywheel effect of, as users come to the platform and curate and take action more, that gives us rich signal to make better and better relevant recommendations. Those more relevant recommendations bring users back to the platform more often and drive more shopping behavior that are there for advertisers to meet those users and create monetization events for us. So we talk about this being the fourth quarter in a row, where we more than doubled the number of outbound clicks to advertisers. Every time we get one of those clicks, that's a shopper that we help find what they were looking for. That feeds us better signal back into what's relevant to bring them back to next time, but also gives us more opportunity to monetize in the future. So that flywheel effect, even beyond the adoption of the product features, that flywheel effect of increasing engagement through relevancy, more shoppable events for more advertisers, bringing more shoppable content onto the platform, more advertised SKUs, those things all compound upon each other. And so we think that while the adoption cycles are multi-quarter, we think the compounding effects are durable and multi-year. So hopefully that helps.\nOperator: We now have Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nShweta Khajuria : Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on ad load. So where do you think is a good normal level for ad load on Pinterest? And what in your opinion are the biggest opportunities on the platform? How are you thinking about balancing engagement as you continue to increase ad load? Thanks a lot.\nBill Ready: Yeah, thank you. Well, as I was just touching on a bit, our engagement continues to deepen. Our WAU to MAU ratio continues to improve through 2024, and that really is driven by actionability. At the core of that actionability has been shoppable ads. So to your question of what's a normal ad load, I think we are still at a fraction of the monetization per unit of intent on our platform that I've seen in analogs from past life. So I think there's a lot more headroom to go. And the headroom on that is really driven by how much you can bring on the right relevant ads that help the user complete their shopping journey, and we see a lot more of that to go. I talked about how Performance+ is helping us bring on more retailers and letting more retailers advertise, how more granular bidding controls allow us to bring on more inventory from each of the retailers. So these things help drive even more shoppability on the platform. And the more we get the right relevant ads, the more we can take the ad load higher. And again, from analogs I would have from past life and that you can see looking at other sort of highly commercial products, particularly in search and places like that, there's a lot more headroom to go in terms of where ad load can go. We're always looking and making sure that is driving positive engagement. In terms of where ad load can go, we're always looking and making sure that is driving positive engagement. And we see that our WAU to MAU ratio continues to improve, really driven by that improved actionability on the platform. And we've talked about things like whole page optimization, where we do that dynamically. We look at when the user's in a commercial context, and we see there. If we can drive more relevant ads, we'll bring more relevant ads, because the user, if they are in a commercial context, cares less about whether the pin is sponsored or not sponsored, and more about, was it the right product for them in that moment, and as we continue to do better and better on that. I talked about how our ad relevance has more than doubled over the last two years in our search results. That's letting us drive more and more relevant ads, where the ads are synergistic with engagement. And again, you see it in our increasing MAUs and our increasing depth of engagement per user. Hopefully that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Go ahead when you're ready.\nMark Mahaney : Okay. I was just going to ask about the Amazon and Google partnerships, and I apologize if you already covered this early on, but any update on how those are progressing, and especially if we look at the average revenue per user metrics, like is the greater monetization \u2013 I think this is more Google than Amazon \u2013 but the greater monetization that we're sort of seeing in ROW in Europe, is that at all being impacted so far by Google, or is it still too small to impact that? Thank you.\nBill Ready: Yeah. Thanks Mark. So we continue to build upon those partnerships. We see them continuing to improve sequentially quarter-on-quarter and build upon themselves. I noted in the call that with Amazon, we're now expanding that to Canada and Mexico, so we're starting to take the Amazon partnership international. And on our rest of world markets, we have both the Google relationship as well as resellers there. I would say, while we're pleased with our progress and we continue to see sequential results that are improving on that, we are earlier days on the Google and international partnerships, than we are on our Amazon third-party relationship. But with each of those, we talked about how we wanted to see them filling in gaps in the auction. We see them doing exactly what they were intended to do, and continuing to build upon themselves even as we go into international markets. And I think on some of your questions like how that's appearing, it is still relatively early days on that rest of world, but we've seen really encouraging progress there even though it's early days.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRich Greenfield : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Bill, you made the comment about UCAN, about deepening engagement, and I guess if we could just drill down a little bit on that. When you think about engagement, is total time spent \u2013 like if you were to look at an individual user, whether it's day, month, week, however best to think about it. But is time spent per Pinterest user in UCAN growing on a year-over-year basis? And could you give us \u2013 I think between the product enhancements and the AI that you spent a lot of time on during your prepared remarks talking to. Everyone's trying to understand, like what is happening to that in terms of total time spent per user? Because obviously that creates more inventory, which fuels your ad business. So any way to quantify or give us some direction on what deepening engagement actually means?\nBill Ready: Yeah, thanks Rich. So this is a really great question, because one of the things that has been a fundamental shift in our business over the last two plus years is that we shifted from being, a couple of years ago, a platform that was chasing entertainment-based use cases, where time spent would have been the right measure. And we shifted from entertainment-based use cases to really driving search-related use cases. Search is two-thirds of our business. So if you look at how our usage breaks out, it's basically a third on home feed and then a third on search and a third on related, which is really just a purely visual search. So two-thirds of our business is search. And when you think about the right way to measure a search business, you would never measure a search business on time spent. In fact, the more time spent in search, oftentimes means you did a worse job of getting you to the right answer. So as we do things like getting the user more relevant results. Talking about the two times improvement in the relevancy of ads, the more than doubling clicks year-on-year for the fourth quarter in a row, those are things that say we're getting our users to the things they were looking for in a better, more compelling way than we were previously. And if you are looking at search, you would never say like, oh, the user found the results on the first \u2013 at the top of the first page, instead of having to tab through four pages. Well, time spent went down, so your product's worse. You would never think of it that way. You would say, \u2018oh, it's a great thing that you got the user the right answer faster.\u2019 So we don't look at time spent, but what we do look at are those measures of actionability. And to the question of depths of engagement per user, again, I think the best way to look at that is our improvement in the weekly active to monthly active ratios. Because as we do a better and better job of making great relevant recommendations to our users, helping them find the things they are looking for in a faster, more compelling way, the more we see them coming back. And that's reflected in that improving WAU to MAU ratio, even as we bring on record levels of new users to the platform. So hopefully that gives you some sense. I talked about clicks and saves and actionability really being in our basket of measures. The things that are improving the most, which is exactly what you'd want to see in a search-driven business in a commercial context. Hopefully that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Colin Sebastian with Baird on the line.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. I have a couple of questions, if I could. I guess first off, you guys have talked about the potential contributions to growth from new advertisers, as well as increasing budget allocations from existing advertisers, and you talked about the two tranches of large advertisers. But any way to break out the contributions from new advertisers this year in terms of the growth rate? And then as a follow-up on, I guess Q4 and what it sort of implies for 2025, it looks like monetization rates were a little bit lower in Europe on a sequential basis. So just curious if there's anything geographically to call out, that could be a headwind to Q4 growth. Thank you.\nBill Ready: Thanks Colin. I'll take the first part, and then I'll give the second part to Julia. On the new advertisers versus existing, we've not broken that out, but we are seeing growth in the total number of active advertisers, and we're seeing a really nice share of wallet gains, particularly with existing enterprise accounts, both with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers and that next tranche of mid-tier advertisers that have revenues in the $1 billion to $30 billion range. And so I've talked about this adoption curve, where as we were looking to make the platform more shoppable. We started with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers, those that could engage with us with the API, and those that had much broader swaths of shoppable inventory. That's really where we saw those largest, most sophisticated advertisers leaning in first, and we've gotten now to 10% plus of digital ad spend with a number of those. That was the first wave of adoption, and we continue to see more opportunity to gain share there, and we see that happening as we give more of these granular controls around item-level bidding and those kinds of things. But we are, as we've noted the last couple of quarters, we're seeing that broaden out into the next tranche of advertisers. First in that $1 billion to $30 billion revenue range, and as we introduce tools like Performance+, that's making it so that smaller and smaller advertisers can in a very simple way see performance from our platform. Really as simple as, give us your seed creative, give us an objective and a budget, and we'll go deliver you great results. And so we see that being a continuing trend as we roll out more and more of these AI-driven advertising tools.\nJulia Donnelly : And then Colin, to your second question on Europe specifically, I would just call it, you know Europe, we saw really good growth in Q3 at 20%. This was down slightly versus 25% in Q2, but that's really in the back of a much tougher comp in Europe last year. Our comp last year went from 12% to 33% and from Q2 to Q3, so that's really the primary driver there. Despite this tougher comp, we're seeing really nice strength in retail in Europe. We expect that to continue. We're also starting to see a mix shift in some of our cross-border spend, which is benefiting the European region this quarter. However, our general strength in retail in Europe is really broad-based and not just driven by one particular advertiser. So we're feeling really strong about Europe in general.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions; one for Bill, one for Julia. Bill, you've double-clicked the advertisers for the past four straight quarters and you talk about the shift from value creation to value capture. Just curious if there's any specific hurdles in your view that keep you from closing the gap more here. And then Julia, on rest-of-world advertiser spending, I think it was down slightly sequentially. Just wondering if there's any comments that you have there or in particular related to APAC advertising. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Thanks, Doug. On the first part of your question there, that value creation, value capture, exactly as you noted, we started out -- Q4 of last year was our first quarter where we were doubling the number of clicks to advertisers year-on-year. And we said then that we had rolled that out in a way that they didn't have to do work to get it, but they'd have to do work to be able to measure it, and they don't shift budgets until they measure it. And so that has been a big focus throughout the year. This year is driving privacy resilient measurement across our advertiser base. I noted in my prepared remarks that we now see more than half the revenue on our platform with privacy resilient measurement. And more than two-thirds of our lower funnel revenue with privacy resilient measurement. So we've continued to see the same trend that we've talked about before, that more than doubling the number of clicks, as we then come behind that and get the advertisers to implement measurement tools, we see consistently that that leads to wallet share shift to us, particularly in those larger, more durable performance budgets. So that trend continues, and we feel really encouraged about the progress that we made this year on getting our advertisers on to privacy resilient measurement, doing a lot to meet them where they are on their ad tools, on clean rooms, on those kinds of things. So while we've made tremendous progress, there is still more of that value capture to go. I've noted that as half of our revenue is on privacy resilient measurement, two-thirds of our lower funnel. That means there is more of that to go. And even for those that have implemented measurement, they are now getting more of our AI-driven advertising tools that I noted in the Performance+ remarks. So there's more of that value capture to come there through the automated bidding, the automated campaign optimization, all those things will lead to more value capture as well. So the raw material, at the end of the day in our business we sell views, clicks, and conversions, and the clicks and conversions are far more valuable than a view. The volume of increase in clicks and conversions has just been a tremendous bright spot. So that raw material continues to be really, really encouraging as we now come behind that and give better measurement, better AI tools for campaign creation and optimization. We see that value capture happening, but there's still a lot more of that in front of us than behind us.\nJulia Donnelly : And Doug, then to the second part of your question on the rest-of-world part of our business, we're actually seeing good acceleration there quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, both on a constant and reported, constant currency and reported basis. So that's where you are really starting to see the growth contribution from some of our week and ongoing partnerships with retailers that we're launching and early contribution from some of our third-party demand partnerships internationally. So we're actually seeing good growth there.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our final question on the line from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nDan Salmon : Great. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for the question. So I want to follow-up on your third-party partnership strategy. You obviously talked about how you are expanding with Amazon. You've talked a lot about kind of the synergy in some of the emerging markets of working with the Google platform, but also having the resellers in there. Does it make sense for you to have more partners? Just curious how you think about that on both, a short-term and long-term basis, maybe some that could bring you demand from different verticals you are underexposed to, maybe in certain markets. Just would love to hear your thoughts on that. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yeah. Thank you for the question. As we've built a plan \u2013 I said this from our very first partnership, that we were building our ability to ingest third-party demand in a way that could allow for many partners. And so we started with Amazon in the U.S., but we always said we would have multiple. We then went to Google on international. We're now expanding Amazon beyond the U.S. We're working with resellers, but we've always intended that we would work with multiple. So while we don't have any new partnerships that we're announcing at the moment, we've built the platform that way, you've seen us expand it that way, and as I mentioned earlier, like we are still significantly under-monetized as a platform relative to the amount of commercial intent on the platform. So as we look at how we bring more advertiser demand to meet that commercial intent, there's a tremendous amount we're doing with first-party, with things like all of our AI-driven performance suite, Performance+. The things that we're doing to bring that in through third-party, the things we're doing to bring it in through resellers, and certainly we expect that we'll have much more that we do there, even though we don't have anything new that we're announcing at the moment there. That is our long-term intent. Hopefully that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Ready : Thank you all again for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going, and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining the Pinterest Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I can confirm today's call has now concluded. Please enjoy the rest of your day, and you may now disconnect from the call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be discussing our third quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary fourth quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Let's start with our third quarter results. We ended the quarter with 537 million global monthly active users, or MAUs, growing 11% and reaching yet another record high. Additionally, we continued to demonstrate user growth across all our reported geographies. In Q3, our US and Canada region had 99 million MAUs, growing 3%. Our Europe region had 139 million MAUs, growing 8%. And in the rest of world markets, we had 300 million MAUs, growing 16%. Moving to revenue, in Q3, our global revenue was $898 million, up 18% on a reported and constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel, with strength coming from our lower funnel consideration and conversion objectives, which optimize for clicks and conversions. From a vertical perspective, we continued to see broad strength in retail. Additionally, emerging verticals, like financial services, automobiles, and technology, continue to be a source of strength. However, this growth was partially offset by ongoing softness within the food and beverage subsector of CPG, where advertisers continue to navigate broader industry headwinds. Next, as expected, revenue from our third party demand partnerships continue to ramp in Q3, growing sequentially off the revenue base we delivered in Q2, as it continues to complement our growing first party business. Turning to our geographical breakouts for Q3. In the US and Canada, we generated $719 million in revenue, growing 16%. Strength came from retail and emerging categories, including financial services, technology, and automobiles. In Europe, revenue was $137 million, growing 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in Europe was driven by retail. Revenue from rest of world was $42 million, growing 38% on a reported basis, or 45% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, ad impressions grew 41%, while ad pricing declined 17% year-over-year. Our efforts to begin serving ads and monetize international markets or previous gaps in our auction have been accretive to net revenue. However, as we started to call out last quarter, the ramp of these initiatives has also naturally led to an increase in ad impressions growth and downward pressure on overall global platform pricing due to this ongoing mix shift. Moving to expenses. Though year-over-year comparisons are becoming more challenging due to the substantial margin expansion achieved in the second half of 2023, we continue to drive adjusted EBITDA margin expansion again in Q3 through effective expense discipline while also allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. In Q3, cost of revenue was $182 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 1% versus Q2 due to increased infrastructure spend related to user and engagement growth partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $478 million, up 15%. The increase was primarily due to R&D, where we are investing in headcount growth with smaller increases in sales and marketing and G&A. Our revenue strength and expense discipline led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA coming in at $242 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27%. This was up approximately 280 basis points versus Q3 last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.4 billion. In the quarter, we allocated $466 million towards share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date spend to $500 million for a total of 15.9 million shares. In addition, we have utilized $306 million of cash year-to-date on net share settlement of equity awards. Lastly, we have replenished our buyback capacity by authorizing a new $2 billion share repurchase program intended to be used over a multiyear period to mitigate dilution from stock-based compensation or opportunistically buyback shares. Now I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.145 billion, representing 15% to 17% growth year-over-year. Based on current spot rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange to be minimal. Turning now to our expense guidance, we expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $495 million to $510 million, growing 11% to 14% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we anticipate a more modest level of year-over-year Q4 non-GAAP cost of revenue leverage versus the prior three quarters as we anniversary significant gains from our cost optimization work. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we continue to invest in headcount for AI talent and other product initiatives supporting users and monetization. Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in both halves of 2024, to at a more modest level in the second half as we anniversary the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in 2024 towards our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin targets. In closing, I'm pleased with our team's performance this quarter, which demonstrates ongoing progress against our strategic plans as we grow users and engagement and continue to strengthen our full-funnel offering for advertisers. With that, I'll hand it over to Bill for some final words. Thanks, Ross. So as you noted, we're guiding Q4 at 15% to 17%, which is roughly similar to the 16% to 18% we guided for Q3. And obviously, we came in at the high end of that range in Q3 at 18%. And that guidance for Q4 reflects the continuation of many of the factors that helped drive our growth in Q3 and really throughout this entire year. Lower funnel revenue growth has been the fastest growing part of our business for the past three quarters, driven by the product innovation we've had over the last 18 months. And we expect that lower funnel strength to continue not just into Q4, but into 2025 and beyond. Revenue from third party demand partnerships also continues to ramp sequentially into Q4. However, we've also noted for the last few quarters that we're seeing softness among food and beverage advertisers who are navigating broader headwinds within that category. And we think this trend continues into Q4 as well. I would also call out that as expected, Performance+ is still in the early rollout phase, with many advertisers limiting budget shifts and adoption of new features during holiday peak period. We also have more functionality on the come with Performance+, with ROAS bidding feature expected to be released in Q1 next year, which is consistent with our prior commentary on the timeline. And just like our previous lower funnel product efforts like MDL, Direct Links, and CAPI, we expect the adoption curve and value capture cycle to be multi-quarter, beginning in 2025, and to further compound the gains we are seeing in the lower funnel. And then Colin, to your second question on Europe specifically, I would just call it, you know Europe, we saw really good growth in Q3 at 20%. This was down slightly versus 25% in Q2, but that's really in the back of a much tougher comp in Europe last year. Our comp last year went from 12% to 33% and from Q2 to Q3, so that's really the primary driver there. Despite this tougher comp, we're seeing really nice strength in retail in Europe. We expect that to continue. We're also starting to see a mix shift in some of our cross-border spend, which is benefiting the European region this quarter. However, our general strength in retail in Europe is really broad-based and not just driven by one particular advertiser. So we're feeling really strong about Europe in general. And Doug, then to the second part of your question on the rest-of-world part of our business, we're actually seeing good acceleration there quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, both on a constant and reported, constant currency and reported basis. So that's where you are really starting to see the growth contribution from some of our week and ongoing partnerships with retailers that we're launching and early contribution from some of our third-party demand partnerships internationally. So we're actually seeing good growth there."

            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. One year ago at our Investor Day, we shared our business vision and outlined the strategic initiatives that we believe will drive long-term sustainable growth. These initiatives include; one, growing users and deepening engagement per user; two, making ads relevant content, which allows us to increase ad load and provide a better user experience simultaneously; three, executing on our lower funnel revenue opportunity; and finally, driving demand through third-party partners, resellers, and international markets as additional levers to growth. We stated that these initiatives, working in tandem, would result in a mid to high-teens revenue growth CAGR and improving profitability, leading to adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to the low 30% range in the next three to five years. One year later, our operating results validate our continued execution against this strategy and commitment to delivering on the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. When we announced our three to five-year financial targets at Investor Day, we had just delivered Q2, 2023 revenue growth of 6%. Since then, on a trailing 12-month basis, as of Q3 2024, we have accelerated revenue growth to 18% and expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Q3 was further evidence of progress against our strategy. As we grew revenue 18% year-over-year, we built out a full funnel ads platform with a particular focus on the lower funnel, which continues to be the fastest growing part of our business as advertisers are increasingly seeing Pinterest as a great place to connect with customers, demonstrating high commercial intent. We're also building a fundamentally better product, focusing on the aspects of Pinterest that make us unique to our audience, the ability to find inspiration, curate, and shop all in one place. We are pleased to report monthly active users of 537 million in Q3, another record high, reflecting 11 % year-over-year growth. Each quarter of record users provides further evidence that we found our best product market fit in years. Today, I'll focus my remarks on discussing themes that are driving progress against the strategy we laid out at Investor Day, starting with an overview about AI and its impact across our business, and moving on to a more specific quarterly update on users, engagement, and monetization. At Pinterest, AI is a core competency and has played a central role in how we have transformed our business over the last two plus years for both our users and advertisers. As we've leaned into this important technology in recent years, we've generated substantial returns from our investments that have fueled growth across our business. Effectively, all content served on Pinterest, including organic and ads, is powered by AI recommendation models that are trained by our unique first-party signal, and AI is only as good as the signal it acts upon. Our AI models generate over 400 million predictions per second, ranking what our users might engage with every time they come to the platform. These rankings leverage hundreds of billions of user actions like searches, saves, and clicks that come from over 0.5 billion logged-in users who are actively exploring, curating, and refining their tastes. This vast data allows us to create highly personalized and relevant recommendations, introducing audiences to new brands, products, and emerging trends. We have distinctive and explicit expressions of intent, like a user searching for and saving outfits to their vacation board. This provides us with real-time insight into what inspires our users and what they're looking to purchase next and provides a holistic understanding of user taste based on their past behavior and other users with similar taste. So, while other platforms may see what their users are looking to purchase today, we see what users are interested in purchasing days, weeks, and even months in advance. This is because the users who come to Pinterest are often undecided, but refine their tastes over multi-session commercial journeys before ultimately deciding what to do or buy. This signal creates a flywheel effect. As users engage with our recommended content through curation actions like saving to boards and creating collages or through clicking and buying behavior, we gather richer data. Incorporating this data into our recommendation algorithms enables us to deliver even more personalized and relevant content, and create a network of product associations unlike any other platform that allows us to effectively recommend content to users with similar tastes. Furthermore, in addition to utilizing our proprietary foundation models in areas where we are differentiated, such as computer vision, we are also leveraging our unique first-party signal to fine tune off-the-shelf large language models for a variety of use cases around organic and ad content serving. This approach has led to phenomenal results, notably a 300-basis point improvement in actionable engagement measured by clicks and saves compared to using an off-the-shelf model not fine-tuned with our data. Our unique user signals and deep understanding of individual interests and tastes also allow us to power monetization with highly relevant ads, making the ad useful content for users. We see this clearly across the platform, including on our search surface, where the average ad's relevance for top ad slots has more than doubled over the past two years. This means when a user searches for commercial queries like, Holiday Home Decor or Fall Boots, they see more ads that are relevant to their query that they can easily shop. Since our users come with commercial intent, these ads do not interrupt their user journey, rather, they enhance it. We also leveraged AI to significantly enhance our ads ranking and delivery systems over the past 18 months, leading to compounding efficiency gains for our advertisers across the platform. Additionally, in moments of high intent, our AI powered whole-page optimization enabled us to flex up ad load to serve more relevant ads to our users, allowing ad load and engagement to grow in tandem. All in all, AI is a core competency at Pinterest and at the center of the significant progress we're making across our technology stack, which is enhancing the experience for users and advertisers alike. With that, let's get into Q3 specifically and discuss our work to grow users and deepen engagement. In Q3, we continued to improve the user inspiration-to-action journey. As a visual search and discovery platform, users come to Pinterest to explore their interests, seek inspiration, and browse items they may like to purchase. They curate and save pins into boards and collages, refining their taste and facilitating future shopping. We've enhanced the actionability of our platform by integrating shopability into all major user experiences and leveraging our computer vision technology to make pins easily shoppable. Users are taking notice of this change, with 66% of weekly Gen Z Pinners saying Pinterest is the first or one of the first services they use to shop, up from 54% the year prior. Through curation, we gain valuable insights into product context, enabling us to refine our recommendations and enhance the user experience. Boards and collages are integral to allowing users to curate their taste on Pinterest, and we continue to make steady investments to improve these features. For example, we recently launched a suite of new collage features, including Collage Remixing, which lets users collaborate, build upon, and use existing collages as a starting point to express their own taste and creativity, thereby reducing the barrier to entry to create a collage. We're also bringing shoppable recommendations to boards, utilizing context from users' own search and save history, as well as our unique product associations to recommend items that might match their taste and allow them to seamlessly move down the funnel from curation to action. At Investor Day, we also discussed the shifts we made to our shopping strategy, most notably shifting from a model that was trying to compete with retailers for the transaction to being an ad-based model that is a deep partner to retailers. Our go-forward strategy is centered on expanding shoppable content, refining recommendations through improved personalization and relevance, and seamlessly connecting users and merchants. Over the past year, we have made significant progress in executing against this strategy, with the goal of making our platform more actionable for users. Notably, for the fourth consecutive quarter, we more than doubled outbound clicks to advertisers year-over-year as we improved the overall actionability of the platform. Additionally, to improve user understanding of which pins are shoppable, we've added visual shopping indicators to product pins in the US and launched filters like On Sale to help users find products that match their budget and preferences. Finally, we're expanding the availability of our shopping features to a broader audience. We recently expanded Shop the Look, which helps users shop what they see in lifestyle imagery to international markets. We also added Ways 2 Style, a module that appears on close-ups for women's fashion pins, showcasing inspiration on how to style the item in an outfit and complementary shoppable products from our catalog. In summary, we are successfully executing a strategy we shared at our Investor Day to drive curation and actionability. As a result, we are seeing steady improvement across the basket of engagement metrics we measure, including the ratio of our weekly active to monthly active users, as well as an exciting increase in the mix of user sessions that include actionability, like curation and outbound clicks. This increasing mix of intent-based and lower-funnel user actions is directly aligned with our efforts to make Pinterest more shoppable for users and a true full-funnel platform for advertisers as well. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by increasing Pinterest's value and performance for advertisers. We delivered strong revenue growth in Q3, up 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in our lower-funnel revenue for the third quarter in a row. As we've discussed before, we've been in the process of transforming our advertising product to be a true performance platform where advertisers can meet our users across the purchase funnel. While shopping has long been a core use cases on Pinterest, advertisers historically lack the tools to effectively drive and measure performance on Pinterest. To address this, we've rolled out multiple lower-funnel products over the past 18 months, all of which compound on each other and become more powerful when used together. Our multi-quarter lower-funnel product rollout began in earnest with tools to drive more seamless handoffs. In mid-2023, we launched Mobile Deep Linking, enabling a one-click transition to an advertiser's mobile application, particularly beneficial for large retailers with deep consumer penetration of their mobile app. We followed this offering with the release of Direct Links, our one-click handoff to an advertiser's mobile or desktop website from Pinterest. Combined, MDL and Direct Links cover 100% of our lower-funnel revenue today and have significantly improved both the shopping experience on Pinterest and advertiser performance. With Q3 being the fourth consecutive quarter, we've more than doubled the clicks to advertisers year-over-year. The success of these tools is evident in our strong lower-funnel revenue growth over the last three quarters, as advertisers increasingly allocate budget to us after seeing performance gains on our platform. We initially began to see value capture in the form of increasing budget allocation from our largest, most sophisticated advertisers who benefited from Mobile Deep Linking and leveraged advanced measurement tools to understand the increase in ROI we were driving. With some of these large advertisers, we've reached more than 5% of their total ad budgets or 10% plus of their digital ad budgets. While Pinterest was traditionally limited to smaller experimental budget pools, we are now taking share in performance budgets that tend to be larger and always on. For the past three quarters, as more advertisers have implemented measurement tools to see the impact of Direct Links, we've started to see the next tranche of large retailers, those in the $1 billion to $30 billion sales range, follow suit and increase their spend. With both of these advertiser segments, we see more headroom to grow share of wallet into 2025 and beyond as advertisers see increasing gains to their lower funnel campaigns through the continued benefits of MDL, Direct Links, shopping ads, and resilient measurement. We also expect our new automation offering, Performance+, to propel an even greater portion of spend from these advertisers as we make campaigns easier to create and more performant. Compounding on the lower funnel improvements we've rolled out over the past 18 months. Diving deeper into automation, after months of beta testing, we officially launched Performance+ for general availability on October 1st. Performance+ brings together AI-driven budgeting, bidding, and targeting functionalities while reducing the effort required from advertisers. Recognizing that giving up control can be challenging for certain marketers, we've gone through multiple levels of alpha and beta testing to validate the effectiveness of automated campaigns in simplifying the experience for marketers and delivering superior ROI. The results are clear, advertisers need 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign, and on average, see a 10% better cost per action. Moreover, advertisers who use Performance+ for their shopping ad campaigns, on average, see a 20% plus cost per action improvement. While we're only five weeks into the general availability launch of Performance+ campaigns, we're pleased with the early signals from advertisers as they begin to adopt the automation suite. This is especially true for the smaller and medium-sized advertisers who have historically struggled to build successful campaigns on Pinterest. Beyond its initial suite of automation tools, Performance+ is expanding to include new creative and bidding features. Performance+ Creative, which also went into general availability in early October, helps advertisers create and optimize their ad creatives across formats, including Generative AI backgrounds on shopping ads. Beta testing has demonstrated a 14% average increase in conversion rate and a 9% lower cost per action for advertisers utilizing Performance+ Creative. For example, Ruggable, an online retailer known for its innovative washable rugs, used Performance+ Creative to automate ad creation from their extensive product catalog. In addition to the significant time and effort savings from automation, they drove a 37% better click-through rate compared to their standard shopping campaigns. Our second key investment area is bidding, with features designed to enable advertisers to bring more inventory onto Pinterest and find value across a broader swath of their catalog. For the largest advertisers, we built in the optionality to bid at the item level of their product catalog, so advertisers can have more granular controls to bid at different price points. For the next tier of advertisers, we introduced Performance+ ROAS bidding, which automatically optimizes bids based on performance or customer value in order to maximize return on ad spend. While ROAS bidding is currently in beta, in our alpha test, most advertisers saw at least a 15% increase in return on ad spend by using Performance+ ROAS bidding. We expect Performance+ ROAS bidding to exit beta testing and be more broadly available to all eligible advertisers in Q1. Underlying our lower funnel improvements are our efforts to implement our resilient measurement solutions. Conversions API, or CAPI, remains our highest priority within the suite of measurement solutions, as it enhances conversion visibility for advertisers and, in turn, can be used to tune and optimize their spend for future performance. We increased our CAPI coverage again this quarter and also introduced CAPI Connect, a lower-touch adoption method for advertisers with fewer in-house developing resources, to further simplify the process. We are also promoting the adoption of other resilient solutions, depending on an advertiser's preference. For example, many of our large retail partners have implemented clean rooms with us to improve their conversion visibility and measurement models. By providing a wider range of durable measurement solutions, we are aligning with advertisers' needs and meeting them where they are. As a result, advertisers utilizing one or more of our privacy-centric measurement tools now make up over half our total revenue, or two-thirds of our lower funnel revenue specifically. We continue to make progress across the lower funnel suite, one of our key investment areas in the business, and look forward to sharing more progress in the quarters to come as this suite of solutions continues to roll out. Next, I'll touch on our global partnership efforts, which are meant to fill in gaps in our auction and expand our international presence. We've made great progress since we discussed these partnerships at our Investor Day a year ago. Starting with our third-party demand partnerships, we announced in September that as a start to our international expansion, we expanded our relationship with Amazon Ads from the U.S. to now include Canada and Mexico as well. Next, our Google partnership continues to grow as we test, learn, and expand to new regions, including both under-monetized and previously un-monetized markets. Both of these partnerships have continued to build sequentially throughout the year, and we expect that trajectory to persist into Q4. Turning to our reseller partnerships. Throughout this year, we have turned on multiple new partnerships to expand our sales coverage across our international footprint. Resellers complement our first-party sales efforts and our third-party demand partnerships and are now helping to drive revenue in over 30 under-monetized markets. We expect these partnerships to ramp in our rest-of-world markets in a steady progression throughout the next few quarters. Finally, with the holiday season right around the corner, I'd be remiss not to discuss some of our most exciting launches to help users shop and help advertisers drive sales during the most important retail period of the year. For users, we're taking the work out of holiday shopping by introducing Gift Guides, curated by celebrities, brands, publishers, and tastemakers, with shoppable gift ideas available to users right in their feed. For advertisers, we've launched a suite of new tools powered by machine learning to better help advertisers highlight their holiday shopping discounts. The first tool is Promotions, which allows advertisers to showcase promotions like free shipping, site-wide sales, and buy one, get one offers to users based on their taste and preferences. The test results have been promising. For example, Spanx was an early adopter of our new promotions feature and saw a 2x increase in click-through rate on their recent campaign. Second, we launched new deal ad modules, making ads with special offers more visible to users with the carousel format, helping brands stand out during sale moments. These enhancements help users easily find that perfect gift they've been looking for and helping advertisers connect with our high intent user base. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we are making across a number of initiatives, many of which were in the early stages of development at our Investor Day a year ago. And I'm even more optimistic about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance. Thanks, Julia. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Thanks Brian. So, first of all, we feel really good about the levers we have to drive new growth in 2025 as we make further continued progress in building out the full funnel platform with a concerted focus on the lower funnel. If we look back at the initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day, those all continue to play out nicely. As I noted, we rolled out a number of lower funnel tools and solutions like mobile deep linking, Direct Links, and CAPI, privacy-resilient measurement. They are leading to the increased share of wallet and value capture especially with our largest, most sophisticated advertisers and now increasingly with the next tranche of advertisers as well. So we see more room to grow with both cohorts of advertisers in 2025. And it's worth noting, that for some of our largest advertisers, lower funnel revenue objectives now account for over 80% of their spend with us, which is up significantly over the last two years and significantly higher than the overall mix of lower funnel that we see across the business. A couple of things to note, Performance+ just went GA with value capture still on to come as you go into 2025, especially for mid-sized accounts as Performance+ really helps automate and expedite new campaign creation. And then of course, global partnerships, including third-party demand, resellers, are also an added contributor as we look into 2025. And then, as we've noted on the last several quarters, macro headwinds specifically within the food and beverage category are not unique to us, but we do have more concentration there, and those are somewhat out of our control. So setting those aside, we continue to feel good about our initiatives to grow the business into 2025 and beyond. And it's worth noting, you asked about \u2013 in your second question of getting to growth in the 20's. If you excluded food and beverage, we grew revenue in the low 20% range in Q3, which really speaks to the strength and the rest of the business on the back of the initiatives that we're driving. And so you talked about durability, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we're moving into those lower funnel performance budgets, those tend to be much larger than the experimental budgets where we played before, and much more durable, and that is increasingly where we are gaining share, so that we feel really good about. And again, if you were to exclude food and beverage where there's been a broader macro headwind, and we just have a little more exposure to that, because of the unique use cases on our platform, the rest of our business growing in the low 20% range in Q3. And then finally on engagement, we continue to be excited with the progress there. We're seeing an increasing mix of sessions that include lower funnel actions, and that's really directly aligned with our efforts to improve actionability. And we have more room to go as monetization per unit of intent is still a fraction of what it could be on the platform, but we've really proven out that Pinterest is a shopping platform. And we've talked about winning with the next generation, with Gen Z. Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop. That's increasing the case year-over-year, as I shared in my prepared remarks, and we see that across the platform. And so again, that's why we feel good about picking up share in those lower funnel objectives, performance budgets, retail being a source of strength. Those are all things that have been consistently part of our story, and those efforts continue to compound on one another. Hopefully that helps. Yeah, thanks for the question Ken. So we're feeling really good about the rollout of Performance+. As you noted, and I noted in my prepared remarks, that went to general availability just at the beginning of October. So we saw really encouraging results from the beta testing and from our early deployment of that, but it is early, and these are always multi-quarter adoption cycles. And I called out in my prepared remarks that a year ago at our Investor Day, we had just printed 6% revenue growth in the quarter before our Investor Day. A year later, we've done 18% revenue growth on a trailing 12-month basis. That's really because the things that we had launched then, Direct Links, mobile deep linking, those early shopping efforts, those paid compounding dividends over the coming year. And we think about Performance+ similarly, that as we go into next year, that that gives us a next leg of budget gains that we can make with advertisers. And some of the stats I called out, those initial results, we're seeing 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign. So to your question about getting to more clients, that really helps us get to those sort of mid-size on down advertisers, where setting up campaigns, finding performance had been a struggle for them. 50% fewer inputs to set up a campaign, and a 20% plus CPA improvement for those. So that's going really well in terms of the performance that we're delivering and the reduction in effort, which should get us to a wired swath of advertisers. The creative side of that, I mentioned the Ruggable Case Study on the call. As we're doing AI-generated creative that makes products appear more visually compelling for users, we're seeing really great results there in the Ruggable Case Study, 37% better click-through rate using Performance+ Creative compared to their standard shopping campaigns. So that gives you a sense of just how significant the benefits are, so a lot more to come on that in 2025. Your question about, so I addressed expanding to more advertisers, where we're going from those very largest event, really picking up steam for some time with us now, to the next sort of $1 billion to $30 billion group. Performance+ campaign creation gets us more of those advertisers. But the other part of your question of like, can we get to more of their inventory, more of the advertiser's inventory? And so this gets to how we grow share of wallet, even for our largest advertisers. Things that we've done like SKU level bidding and ROAS bidding, these help the advertiser bid at a more granular level, and see performance across a much wider swath of their inventory, which should bring more advertised inventory onto the platform, and be another source of expansion as we go into next year. So that Performance+ ROAS bidding that I mentioned, that's still in beta with encouraging results and general availability on that to come in Q1. So both those things, all those things together really give us confidence that there's a lot more share of wallet that we can gain. And that's all at the back of the inherent commerciality of our users. Again, we've really proven out Pinterest as a great place to shop. So its early days, but we're really encouraged by what we're seeing there, given the strong performance among the beta advertisers, and we do see incrementality there and early signs of budget shift. So while that broader adoption is more H1, the signs there are encouraging, even though advertisers don't make big shifts during the holiday shopping season. Yeah, thanks Ron. So, on the engagement question, just to be really crystal clear about this, the significant improvement in user growth and DPA engagement has been a bright spot over the past two years. Those trends continue to be really encouraging as we continue to deepen engagement, while also reaching record high monthly active users. A place you can see that really clearly is in the steady improvement in our WAU to MAU ratio in 2024, even as we bring in record amounts of new users. Oftentimes, bringing in a lot of new users can be dilutive to your engagement per user. But even as we bring on record amounts of new users, our WAU to MAU ratio continues to see steady improvement, which just really gets to how we're driving depth of engagement and how as we bring more relevant shoppable content, including ads, onto the platform, that's driving further user engagement. When you unpack what's driving engagement across the back of activities that we look at, we see that actionability, specifically sessions with curation and clicks, are driving an increasing share of engagement. That's really encouraging as it aligns with the shift of our business model toward the lower funnel and is a higher value activity, both for the user and the advertiser, compared to passive view time alone. So that's really encouraging. And finally, our most mature markets are our most engaged, with engagement per MAU being highest in UCAN, and continuing to grow, and that's consistent with our other developed markets. So we're furthest along in our actionability efforts in these mature markets, but lots of opportunity as we take that further internationally. But these things do continue to build upon themselves. And so you were asking about lower funnel adoption. As we've called out many times, these things are multi-quarter adoption cycles for retailers. But it's also worth noting that, in addition to the multi-quarter adoption cycle, you see compounding benefits to these things. So we've talked about the flywheel effect of, as users come to the platform and curate and take action more, that gives us rich signal to make better and better relevant recommendations. Those more relevant recommendations bring users back to the platform more often and drive more shopping behavior that are there for advertisers to meet those users and create monetization events for us. So we talk about this being the fourth quarter in a row, where we more than doubled the number of outbound clicks to advertisers. Every time we get one of those clicks, that's a shopper that we help find what they were looking for. That feeds us better signal back into what's relevant to bring them back to next time, but also gives us more opportunity to monetize in the future. So that flywheel effect, even beyond the adoption of the product features, that flywheel effect of increasing engagement through relevancy, more shoppable events for more advertisers, bringing more shoppable content onto the platform, more advertised SKUs, those things all compound upon each other. And so we think that while the adoption cycles are multi-quarter, we think the compounding effects are durable and multi-year. So hopefully that helps. Yeah, thank you. Well, as I was just touching on a bit, our engagement continues to deepen. Our WAU to MAU ratio continues to improve through 2024, and that really is driven by actionability. At the core of that actionability has been shoppable ads. So to your question of what's a normal ad load, I think we are still at a fraction of the monetization per unit of intent on our platform that I've seen in analogs from past life. So I think there's a lot more headroom to go. And the headroom on that is really driven by how much you can bring on the right relevant ads that help the user complete their shopping journey, and we see a lot more of that to go. I talked about how Performance+ is helping us bring on more retailers and letting more retailers advertise, how more granular bidding controls allow us to bring on more inventory from each of the retailers. So these things help drive even more shoppability on the platform. And the more we get the right relevant ads, the more we can take the ad load higher. And again, from analogs I would have from past life and that you can see looking at other sort of highly commercial products, particularly in search and places like that, there's a lot more headroom to go in terms of where ad load can go. We're always looking and making sure that is driving positive engagement. In terms of where ad load can go, we're always looking and making sure that is driving positive engagement. And we see that our WAU to MAU ratio continues to improve, really driven by that improved actionability on the platform. And we've talked about things like whole page optimization, where we do that dynamically. We look at when the user's in a commercial context, and we see there. If we can drive more relevant ads, we'll bring more relevant ads, because the user, if they are in a commercial context, cares less about whether the pin is sponsored or not sponsored, and more about, was it the right product for them in that moment, and as we continue to do better and better on that. I talked about how our ad relevance has more than doubled over the last two years in our search results. That's letting us drive more and more relevant ads, where the ads are synergistic with engagement. And again, you see it in our increasing MAUs and our increasing depth of engagement per user. Hopefully that's helpful. Yeah. Thanks Mark. So we continue to build upon those partnerships. We see them continuing to improve sequentially quarter-on-quarter and build upon themselves. I noted in the call that with Amazon, we're now expanding that to Canada and Mexico, so we're starting to take the Amazon partnership international. And on our rest of world markets, we have both the Google relationship as well as resellers there. I would say, while we're pleased with our progress and we continue to see sequential results that are improving on that, we are earlier days on the Google and international partnerships, than we are on our Amazon third-party relationship. But with each of those, we talked about how we wanted to see them filling in gaps in the auction. We see them doing exactly what they were intended to do, and continuing to build upon themselves even as we go into international markets. And I think on some of your questions like how that's appearing, it is still relatively early days on that rest of world, but we've seen really encouraging progress there even though it's early days. Yeah, thanks Rich. So this is a really great question, because one of the things that has been a fundamental shift in our business over the last two plus years is that we shifted from being, a couple of years ago, a platform that was chasing entertainment-based use cases, where time spent would have been the right measure. And we shifted from entertainment-based use cases to really driving search-related use cases. Search is two-thirds of our business. So if you look at how our usage breaks out, it's basically a third on home feed and then a third on search and a third on related, which is really just a purely visual search. So two-thirds of our business is search. And when you think about the right way to measure a search business, you would never measure a search business on time spent. In fact, the more time spent in search, oftentimes means you did a worse job of getting you to the right answer. So as we do things like getting the user more relevant results. Talking about the two times improvement in the relevancy of ads, the more than doubling clicks year-on-year for the fourth quarter in a row, those are things that say we're getting our users to the things they were looking for in a better, more compelling way than we were previously. And if you are looking at search, you would never say like, oh, the user found the results on the first \u2013 at the top of the first page, instead of having to tab through four pages. Well, time spent went down, so your product's worse. You would never think of it that way. You would say, \u2018oh, it's a great thing that you got the user the right answer faster.' So we don't look at time spent, but what we do look at are those measures of actionability. And to the question of depths of engagement per user, again, I think the best way to look at that is our improvement in the weekly active to monthly active ratios. Because as we do a better and better job of making great relevant recommendations to our users, helping them find the things they are looking for in a faster, more compelling way, the more we see them coming back. And that's reflected in that improving WAU to MAU ratio, even as we bring on record levels of new users to the platform. So hopefully that gives you some sense. I talked about clicks and saves and actionability really being in our basket of measures. The things that are improving the most, which is exactly what you'd want to see in a search-driven business in a commercial context. Hopefully that's helpful. Thanks Colin. I'll take the first part, and then I'll give the second part to Julia. On the new advertisers versus existing, we've not broken that out, but we are seeing growth in the total number of active advertisers, and we're seeing a really nice share of wallet gains, particularly with existing enterprise accounts, both with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers and that next tranche of mid-tier advertisers that have revenues in the $1 billion to $30 billion range. And so I've talked about this adoption curve, where as we were looking to make the platform more shoppable. We started with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers, those that could engage with us with the API, and those that had much broader swaths of shoppable inventory. That's really where we saw those largest, most sophisticated advertisers leaning in first, and we've gotten now to 10% plus of digital ad spend with a number of those. That was the first wave of adoption, and we continue to see more opportunity to gain share there, and we see that happening as we give more of these granular controls around item-level bidding and those kinds of things. But we are, as we've noted the last couple of quarters, we're seeing that broaden out into the next tranche of advertisers. First in that $1 billion to $30 billion revenue range, and as we introduce tools like Performance+, that's making it so that smaller and smaller advertisers can in a very simple way see performance from our platform. Really as simple as, give us your seed creative, give us an objective and a budget, and we'll go deliver you great results. And so we see that being a continuing trend as we roll out more and more of these AI-driven advertising tools. Thanks, Doug. On the first part of your question there, that value creation, value capture, exactly as you noted, we started out -- Q4 of last year was our first quarter where we were doubling the number of clicks to advertisers year-on-year. And we said then that we had rolled that out in a way that they didn't have to do work to get it, but they'd have to do work to be able to measure it, and they don't shift budgets until they measure it. And so that has been a big focus throughout the year. This year is driving privacy resilient measurement across our advertiser base. I noted in my prepared remarks that we now see more than half the revenue on our platform with privacy resilient measurement. And more than two-thirds of our lower funnel revenue with privacy resilient measurement. So we've continued to see the same trend that we've talked about before, that more than doubling the number of clicks, as we then come behind that and get the advertisers to implement measurement tools, we see consistently that that leads to wallet share shift to us, particularly in those larger, more durable performance budgets. So that trend continues, and we feel really encouraged about the progress that we made this year on getting our advertisers on to privacy resilient measurement, doing a lot to meet them where they are on their ad tools, on clean rooms, on those kinds of things. So while we've made tremendous progress, there is still more of that value capture to go. I've noted that as half of our revenue is on privacy resilient measurement, two-thirds of our lower funnel. That means there is more of that to go. And even for those that have implemented measurement, they are now getting more of our AI-driven advertising tools that I noted in the Performance+ remarks. So there's more of that value capture to come there through the automated bidding, the automated campaign optimization, all those things will lead to more value capture as well. So the raw material, at the end of the day in our business we sell views, clicks, and conversions, and the clicks and conversions are far more valuable than a view. The volume of increase in clicks and conversions has just been a tremendous bright spot. So that raw material continues to be really, really encouraging as we now come behind that and give better measurement, better AI tools for campaign creation and optimization. We see that value capture happening, but there's still a lot more of that in front of us than behind us. Yeah. Thank you for the question. As we've built a plan \u2013 I said this from our very first partnership, that we were building our ability to ingest third-party demand in a way that could allow for many partners. And so we started with Amazon in the U.S., but we always said we would have multiple. We then went to Google on international. We're now expanding Amazon beyond the U.S. We're working with resellers, but we've always intended that we would work with multiple. So while we don't have any new partnerships that we're announcing at the moment, we've built the platform that way, you've seen us expand it that way, and as I mentioned earlier, like we are still significantly under-monetized as a platform relative to the amount of commercial intent on the platform. So as we look at how we bring more advertiser demand to meet that commercial intent, there's a tremendous amount we're doing with first-party, with things like all of our AI-driven performance suite, Performance+. The things that we're doing to bring that in through third-party, the things we're doing to bring it in through resellers, and certainly we expect that we'll have much more that we do there, even though we don't have anything new that we're announcing at the moment there. That is our long-term intent. Hopefully that's helpful. Thank you all again for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going, and we hope you all enjoy the rest of your day."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Q2 marked another strong quarter of growth in users and revenue, driven by continued progress against our strategic initiatives. On the user side, we're leaning into what our users love most about Pinterest, the ability to find inspiration and take action seamlessly in one platform. And as we've said before, we found our best product market fit in years. Q2 global MAUs reached another record high of $522 million, growing 12% year-over-year. On the monetization side, our investments to become a true full-funnel platform, particularly our efforts to build out our lower funnel offerings, are paying off with Q2 revenue of $854 million, up 21% year-over-year. We also continue to drive significant improvements in profitability, resulting in Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $180 million or a 21% margin, up 600 basis points versus Q2 last year. Before I dive into my usual business update, I wanted to start with a few anecdotes from my time last month at Cannes Lions, one of the largest advertising industry events of the year, as it reflects the momentum building around Pinterest. Advertisers are taking note of Gen Z love for Pinterest and are increasingly understanding how they can meet this audience on our platform across their inspiration to action journey. They are also seeing firsthand how our investments in the lower funnel are driving tangible success through our increased clicks and conversions. And this momentum was evident at Cannes, as we saw a 50% increase in the number of visits to our activation this year and a 40% increase in the number of advertisers we met with at this important event. While at Cannes, we created an immersive activation experience where attendees could discover user behavior on Pinterest firsthand, and what one CEO said felt like stepping into a real-life inspiration board. We created a space where attendees, many of whom were Gen Z, could take a break from talking and hearing about creativity and actually be creative with Pinterest. We also previewed our latest AI and automation tools to drive even more performance for our advertisers through the launch of Performance+, which was very well received. I'll discuss more about Performance+ later in my remarks. Shifting now to our quarterly update, beginning with users and engagement, last quarter, we reviewed the initiatives over the last two years that have taken us from declining users to sustained user growth. These initiatives are: one, utilizing AI to drive increased relevance and personalization; two, doubling down on curation through boards and collages to help users navigate their inspiration to action journey; three, increasing actionability, particularly for shopping, allowing our users to bring their inspiration to life; and four, creating a more positive alternative to traditional social media. When combined, these initiatives have had compounding effects and have led to the healthy MAU growth we're seeing today across all geographic regions and the age cohorts we track. Now, I'll share more about the key recent product launches that demonstrate continued progress against our strategy and the initiatives that I've outlined. First, we're helping our users more effectively find inspiration and discover new, relevant content that resonates with their interests through our investments in AI. We've made ongoing progress to modernize the core AI that powers the content users are shown, leading to meaningful improvements to the relevance and personalization of our content recommendations. As an example, in Q2, we upgraded our search ranking algorithm to incorporate new signals, enabling us to recommend more relevant and ultimately engaging content for the user. This resulted in a significant increase in our global search fulfillment rate, which means our users are finding more of what they are looking for when they search on Pinterest. A part of our efforts to improve content discovery is to help users refine their searches, which often start as short, broad queries, as users come to us with a general sense of what they are looking for, but don't have the precise words to describe it or will know it when they see it. We're continuing to invest in bolstering content discovery through Generative AI-based guided search, which we first rolled out several months ago for the Home Decor vertical. Guided search provides a structured way to break down these broad queries into narrower avenues of exploration. For example, a search for a broad query like kitchen ideas might lead a user to more refined options like DIY kitchen projects or Backsplash Inspiration to further explore their taste and move down the inspiration to action journey. We're finding a notably strong product user fit for guided search with our more episodic users, who are generally less familiar with the platform and thus find value in the structured experience to discover fulfilling results. Second, we're leaning into curation, a key differentiating feature of Pinterest and one that users leverage as a pivotal step to navigate their journey from inspiration to action. Said simply, it's how they refine their choices and decide what to buy. Human curation on the platform bolsters our content flywheel, providing rich first-party signals early in customer shopping journeys. These signals are predictive of user interests and allow us to drive even more relevance to users via enhanced content recommendations. We've been reinvesting in making the curation journey on Pinterest easier to use and more engaging for our users through updates to boards and through our new content format, collages. On the board side, it's more intuitive to create, save to, and share boards than ever, with a refined user interface and new features like auto-organization that utilizes AI to identify and automatically group together pins into new boards, saving users the need to organize it themselves. We're also making it easier for users to share their taste and style with others. In Q2, we launched Board Sharing, a new feature allowing users to share engaging videos of their Pinterest boards, like Dream Home Decor or Ultimate Travel Bucket List, to other social platforms for the first time. This feature also enables us to include a link for others to explore their boards on a platform as well. We're also collaborating with power users like musician Avril Lavigne, who used board sharing to give her fans a sneak peek into the inspiration behind her tour outfits to bring this feature to life for a broader audience and showcase the magic of curation on Pinterest. We're continuing to make progress with collages, a highly interactive new content format developed using advanced computer vision technology, which allows users to cut out components like a shirt or a pair of shoes from other images and piece them together into one highly engaging and interactive pin. And as we've mentioned before, we're seeing that this content format resonates with our audience, who save collages roughly three times more often than our traditional pins, especially with our Gen Z audience who uses collages to express their personal aesthetic. In Q2, we extended collages to advertisers, meaning they can now create engaging collages using cutouts of product pins from their own catalog and promote them as ads. In fact, brands like Nike, John Lewis, and Bumble and Bumble are utilizing collages to showcase their product catalog in a unique and visually appealing way. And finally, we're driving further actionability across Pinterest by launching features that allow users to move further along in their shopping journeys and take action on what they see. In doing so, we more than doubled the number of outbound clicks we sent to advertisers year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. And as we improve overall actionability and make it easier for users to find what they're looking for, we're seeing that users are able to successfully complete their journeys on Pinterest more quickly. In Q2, we ship more new filters like price, retailer, and brand on high shopping intent search queries across fashion and home decor verticals. We're also experimenting with other filters, including on sale, to give users more control over their shopping journeys and find products tailored to their style and budget. And with this valuable signal, we can then recommend even more relevant and personalized shoppable content to our users. We're also making video more shoppable on the platform, as it is an integral content format on the inspiration to action journey. As an example, in Q1, we launched Shop to Look on Video to help users shop items that bring them inspiration in the videos they were already watching. In Q2, we introduced video shopping ads to complement all the work we've been doing to drive actionability across formats and surfaces. With video shopping ads, merchants can seamlessly add videos to their product catalogs on Pinterest and promote them. Hundreds of advertisers have already started incorporating video in their product catalogs, given the strong visual nature of our platform. For mass retailers who have adopted this format, shoppable video ads drove a higher click-through rate and lower cost per action compared to static catalog ads. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable and performant for advertisers. We delivered strong revenue growth in Q2, and the momentum we're driving in the business is evidence of all the work we've been doing over the last several quarters to significantly improve our ad offering, as the initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day continue to deliver as we expected or better. This includes; one, our investments to become a true full funnel ad platform, particularly through our new lower funnel offerings, which are creating significant value for advertisers; two, continuing to increase ad load driven by the synergies between our users' strong commercial intent and relevant ads; and lastly, third-party partners, resellers, and international as additional levers to revenue growth. We're seeing advertisers take notice of the growing momentum in our business, and we're gaining share with some of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world. As I look ahead, there's a lot more to do, but it is clear that the strategy we've employed is working. Shifting to our full funnel ad solutions, we've been hard at work improving our offering to help advertisers meet consumers across the full funnel. Pinterest is a place where advertisers can build their brand in a positive environment, drive consideration when the consumer is not yet decided, and ultimately deliver conversions all on one platform. We see that over 90% of search queries don't specify a brand or specific product, but rather a categorical interest, such as Fun Summer Dresses or Cool White Sneakers or Mid-Century Bedroom Decor. This is a magic moment for advertisers to connect with users who have clear commercial intent, but have not yet decided what they want to buy. Many of our advertisers are taking advantage of the full funnel, with over half of our large advertisers using multiple campaign objectives. Moreover, advertisers who use upper and lower funnel objectives see two times higher conversion rates than those who use one objective alone. Within the full funnel, we focus the majority of our monetization efforts on the lower funnel to drive performance in the form of clicks and conversions to advertisers. We've made substantial progress across our entire platform to improve actionability and allow users to shop at the point of inspiration. Nowhere does this manifest more than within the lower funnel, where relevant shoppable ads can be great content on Pinterest. And whole page optimization, powered by AI, allows us to show more of these relevant shoppable ads when users are in moments of high commercial intent. Over the last year, we've also made significant progress in making the purchase journey more seamless for our users, with products like Mobile Deeplinking and Direct Links. Now, nearly 100% of our lower funnel revenue is covered by Direct Links or Mobile Deeplinking, which means it takes just one click to lead the user directly to an advertiser's product or purchase page. The changes we've made are having real impacts, as we've now more than doubled the amount of clicks to advertisers year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. As advertisers have begun to notice improvements in their measurement sources of truth, many of the largest, most sophisticated advertisers are voting with their dollars and driving more budget to Pinterest. We're beginning to see value capture from the next tranche of advertisers as well and believe much of the value capture from Direct Links is still ahead of us, as advertisers continue to take note of the consistent increase in click volume we are delivering. However, the pace at which advertisers adjust their budgets depends on a variety of factors, including seeing this performance appear in their individual measurement sources of truth and the level of resourcing required to implement incremental campaigns. We anticipate that with the rollout of our new automation suite, Performance+, which I'll discuss shortly in more detail, we'll be able to alleviate some of this heavy lifting on the advertiser's side. This should drive even greater value creation through improved campaign setup and efficiency, leading to compounding performance effects through our full lower funnel solution set and ultimately further value capture. Finally, we're also continuing to drive more actionability in the lower funnel through incorporating third-party ads into our auction to grow relevant shoppable ad demand. As we expected, third-party ad demand became an even larger source of revenue this quarter and is continuing to fill in gaps in the auction, especially on our high-intent surfaces like search and related items where relevant ads are additive shoppable content for our users. We know that performance is only as good as the advertiser's ability to measure it. Because of this, we're focused on driving adoption of our privacy-centric measurement tools like Conversions API and Clean Rooms. We continue to grow adoption of these tools in Q2 with a sharp focus on advertisers with lower funnel shopping and conversion objectives. This adoption has been driven by a few key initiatives. First, we are easing the onboarding process for advertisers with the goal of meeting advertisers where they are with whichever third-party solutions they are using. As such, we revamped our developer site and continue to increase the number of third-party integration partnerships. Second, we have bolstered our own seller training efforts and education to help advertisers understand how these solutions can strengthen their conversion visibility. With that, we continue to make measurement adoption a key priority for our sales force and tie a portion of seller incentive compensation to privacy-centric measurement adoption. While we want advertisers to adopt our own solutions and best practices, we recognize that many of them have their own measurement source of truth. To that end, we focused our efforts on making sure we are showing up correctly and consistently wherever an advertiser measures their performance. Moving to AI and automation, our work to build out our lower funnel suite continued in Q2 with the announcement of Performance+. This brand-new offering, which recently entered beta for a limited number of advertisers, brings together all of our AI and automation tools across bidding, budgeting, and targeting to improve campaign performance on Pinterest. With Performance+, lower funnel advertisers can use these tools in concert to unlock our most powerful automation and AI features, all within a new simplified campaign setup. Advertisers can also apply any of these features to non-Performance+ campaigns, giving them the ultimate control based on their unique needs. We are excited about Performance+ as the next iteration of our lower funnel suite. As we roll out these tools, we expect a similar multi-quarter product uptake and adoption curve as our previous lower funnel launches, like shopping ads, Mobile Deeplinking and Direct Links, and Conversions APIs. This suite of tools, when used together, compound upon each other to drive powerful lower funnel performance for our advertisers. While still early, the test results have been positive. Many of the advertisers who participated in our Performance+ Alpha test this spring saw a greater than 10% improvement in cost per acquisition for their lower funnel conversion and shopping ad campaigns, or a greater than 10% improvement in cost per click, CPC, for consideration campaigns. For example, outdoor apparel brand Timberland was an early tester of Performance+ in the UK, and saw a 34% lower cost per action, a 16% increase in click-through rate, and ultimately a 50% higher return on ad spend from their Performance+ enabled campaign versus their traditional campaigns. In addition, Performance+ significantly reduces the time required for advertisers to create a campaign, with 50% fewer inputs than a traditional creation flow. We are also testing additional automation solutions, which we plan to incorporate into the Performance+ suite in the coming months. These include Performance+ bidding for ROAS, which automatically optimizes advertisers' bids to drive the highest ROI, and Performance+ creative, which helps advertisers make new ad creative using Generative AI and optimize their existing creative across multiple ad formats. Performance+ creative is already driving tangible results for advertisers. Fashion marketplace Poshmark, an early tester of the product, saw a 25% lift in click-through rates on products with a Performance+ generative background versus a white background. As we continue to iterate, we will roll these features out to a broader swath of lower funnel advertisers, and we'll have more to share as we progress through the second half of the year. Overall, I'm proud of our latest automation rollout, a continuation of our efforts to deliver the best possible performance for advertisers and reduce friction in doing so. Our goal is for advertisers to be able to provide us with a budget, a goal, and their Seed Creative, and we'll do the rest. With that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll be discussing our second quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary third quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Let's dive into our second quarter results. We ended the quarter with 522 million global monthly active users, or MAUs, growing 12% and reaching another record high. Users continued to grow year-over-year across all of our geographic regions due to the compounding effects of the initiatives Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks, where improved personalization, curation, and actionability are driving enhanced inspiration to action journeys for users. Specifically, in Q2, in the U.S. and Canada, we had 98 million MAUs growing 3%. In Europe, we had 136 million MAUs growing 9%, and in our rest of world markets, we had 288 million MAUs growing 17%. Now on to revenue. In Q2, our global revenue was $854 million, up 21% on a reported and constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel with particular strength coming from our lowest funnel conversion objective. From a vertical perspective, we once again saw broad strength in retail. Our larger, more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform as they have adopted our lower funnel tools and are seeing continued success. We're also starting to see signs of value capture from the next tranche of advertisers as we have doubled clicks for the third quarter in a row and those advertisers are beginning to see that impact in their measurement sources of truth and adjusting spending accordingly. Additionally, emerging verticals like technology, autos, and financial services were sources of strength. However, this growth was partially offset by softness within CPG, specifically food and beverage advertisers, who are navigating broader headwinds within that category. Next, as expected, revenue from our third-party demand partnerships continued to ramp in Q2, growing sequentially off the revenue base we delivered in Q1 as it continues to complement our growing first-party business. Turning to our geographical breakouts for Q2. In the U.S. and Canada, we generated $673 million in revenue, growing 19%. Strength came from retail and from emerging categories, including technology, autos, and financial services. In Europe, revenue was $143 million, growing 25% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in Europe was driven by retail. Revenue from the rest of the world was $38 million, growing 32% on a reported basis or 36% on a constant currency basis. In Q2, ad impressions grew 35% while ad pricing declined 11% year-over-year. These dynamics were similar to Q1, with ad impressions being driven both by increases in total impressions as well as increases in ad load. Similarly, pricing continues to be lower year-over-year as we continue to drive increased value to advertisers in the form of more clicks and greater efficiency. We continue to drive increases in ad load through whole-page optimization, which increases the supply of relevant ads to users in moments of high commercial intent, and we see opportunity to increase ad load moving forward as we further improve the actionability of our users' journeys and the relevance of our ads. In Q2, we also saw a greater mix shift to ad impressions with lower average pricing, or eCPMs. This was influenced by two factors. First, we started serving ads in previously unmonetized markets, mostly in our rest of world region, many of which have lower eCPMs than our existing monetized markets. And second, on a global basis, we are seeing growth in third-party ad impressions to fill in gaps in our auction in places that were previously under-monetized or not monetized at all. Right now, we are mainly filling these in with relevant demand from third parties, but over time as we increase demand further, we expect to see greater auction pressure and therefore higher eCPMs for these ad flocks. Moving to expenses. For the past several quarters, we've been able to drive continued margin expansion through effective expense discipline by allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. In Q2, cost of revenue was $180 million, up 9% year-over-year, and up 2% versus Q1, due to increased infrastructure spend related to user and engagement growth and partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $497 million, up 13%. The increase was primarily driven by headcount growth and R&D, increased marketing expense, and increased G&A driven by non-income based taxes and other employee-related costs. Our revenue strength and expense discipline led to another solid quarter of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, coming in at $180 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%. This was up approximately 600 basis points versus Q2 last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. In Q2, we utilized approximately $120 million of cash on net share settlement of equity awards, plus an additional $34 million on share repurchases. Now I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the third quarter. We expect Q3, 2024 revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $900 million, representing 16% to 18% growth year-over-year. Let me share some additional context as we look forward to Q3. Our revenue guidance reflects further progress against our strategic initiatives, including continued lower funnel strength and the ongoing emerging contribution from third-party demand partnerships. The underlying health of our business remains strong, and we continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead. However, as we move into Q3, we are facing tougher comps since our revenue growth nearly doubled from Q2 to Q3 last year. It is also worth noting that at current spot rates, we are expecting a foreign exchange to move against us for the first time in five quarters, resulting in a 1 point headwind for Q3. Finally, our guidance does not assume a material improvement in trend for the food and beverage category or significant revenue contribution from the launch of Performance+, as we are still currently in the testing phase with a small number of advertisers. Turning now to our expense guidance. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $485 million to $500 million, growing 17% to 20% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to realize modest additional benefits from our ongoing infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore we anticipate Q3 non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q2. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we continue to invest in headcount for AI talent across our business. As we have said previously, for full year 2024, we are anticipating year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023, as we balance investing in growth and flowing profitability through to the bottom line. We also continue to expect margin expansion in both halves of 2024. So, consistent with our prior remarks, we expect a more modest level of margin expansion in the second half versus significantly higher expansion in the first half, as we begin to lap the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. In closing, I'm proud of our team for delivering yet another strong quarter of results as we execute against our strategic plans. Our continued gains are evidence of the momentum in our business and underpin our confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans. Now, I'll hand it over to Bill for some final words.\nBill Ready : Thanks Julia. I want to thank our team at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler : Great. Just maybe starting with the macro, so the 17% growth for the third quarter at the midpoint, obviously, reflects some deceleration from 2Q, but it's within your long-term high-teens range. But Julia, you just mentioned a few factors. Could you just flesh out for us how much of the deceleration you would chalk up to tougher comps versus the factors that you mentioned? And then how much might partner revenue increases or ad load increases help offset the factors that are driving deceleration? Thanks a lot.\nJulia Donnelly: Great. Thanks, Ross. So, we feel good about the levers to drive our business. Our initiatives are trending consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day. The products we put in market are doing exactly what we've intended for them to do. Looking to Q3, our guidance is a continuation of many of the factors that have helped drive growth in Q1, Q2, and now into Q3, including value capture from lower funnel products and third-party demand growing off the Q2 revenue base again. And we noted in the prepared remarks that we expect FX to switch to a one-point headwind for us at current spot rates. And so, the 16% to 18% guidance for Q3 would have effectively been one point higher without this FX headwind. That higher range, excluding the FX impact, is roughly consistent with the growth we've drove in Q2 and Q1 this year, particularly when accounting for some of the unique seasonal factors that benefited Q1 that we highlighted on our prior earnings call, including the Easter timing shift and leap day. So, the underlying growth rate of the business is holding effectively stable, despite the fact that our comps last year did start to become more difficult in Q3, and the fact that we're experiencing further softness in food and beverage. And if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, you'll see that strength persist as well. And then lastly, as some of you may remember, it's worth noting that we do not accept political ads, so that's a difference to account for as you compare us to other platforms as well.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is now open.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the detail on the call. I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on user engagement trends, just given all the efforts you've made to improve the amount of relevancy of personalized content. And related to that, are you seeing any impact from seasonality over the summer months in engagements? And I would also just be curious as well, how much additional growth you see here from ad load as you try to balance both the organic content, as well as the increasing mix of ads. Thank you.\nBill Ready: Great. Thanks for the question. I'd say engagement continues to be a real highlight for us overall. The general trend of not only accelerating user growth, and you saw us put up 12% user growth overall, not only is that holding, this general trend of engagement per user deepening is also continuing to hold. So Play seems to see that clearly. It\u2019s really in the steady improvement in our WAU to MAU ratio in 2024, even as we bring in record amounts of new users. So if you pull back the covers on that, and this will get a little bit more to your question on some of the different dynamics of Play. You pull back the covers on that, there's some really exciting things happening with the way that users are engaging. As we've been driving improvements in curation and actionability, we're seeing more and more clicks and conversions from users. This is really great for users, because it means they are finding more of what they are looking for on Pinterest, and it's great for advertisers, because they see clicks and conversions as much more valuable than impressions. And to your comment around ad load, we've been talking about ads as great content for users, particularly when they are in a commercial context, and those ads are relevant to what they are looking for. So we continue to see that synergistic dynamic there, because we have more than half our users on the platform to shop. So that's been a real lever for us. We think it continues to be. And so back to engagement, we track a number of engagement metrics, and we continue to see nice growth in engagement across the platform, measured by the various signals there. But with clicks and lower funnel behavior becoming a more meaningful part of that mix, which again is really encouraging. We're also seeing deeper penetration with our mobile app users who tend to be more sticky and highly engaged users. And finally, I\u2019ll just call out that we've added more of that highly desirable lower funnel behavior as we've seen that from our users. We're adding that more into how we're measuring success for the business, for our teams, and in how we are continuing to enhance that flywheel on synergistic effect between ads as great content for users that are in commercial context. Maybe I'll pause there. And Julie, anything you'd add to that?\nJulia Donnelly: Yeah. So maybe just to share a little bit more color. Previously we measured engagement as sessions longer than 60 seconds, impressions and saves. And as Bill talked about, we've evolved our platform to be more actionable, and we've updated our view of engagement to include some of these additional dimensions that are also important signals of depth of engagement, including things like measuring outbound clicks and looking at curation signals like collage creation, for example, which is a newer feature on our platform. So as Bill mentioned, overall engagement signals remain strong, and we're also seeing this exciting shift that outbound clicks are becoming a more meaningful part of user behavior, as users are able to find what they are looking for more quickly. And we believe this is a healthy evolution of the platform, and it's also kind of better aligned with the value we're providing advertisers since we sell ads across the full funnel on a views, clicks and conversions basis.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I could. Following up on Ross's question before about end demand, is there any differences you are seeing by geography in terms of the end demand environment you are finding yourself in with respect to digital ads? That would be part one. And part two, Bill, you gave a lot of detail, especially with going to comm [ph] intra-quarter, about the shift that Pinterest is seeing in terms of advertiser demand away from the macro environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of your competitive positioning, changing or shifting with respect to the broader digital advertising ecosystem? Go a little bit deeper there. Thanks so much.\nBill Ready: Great. Maybe I'll start with the second one first, and then give it to Julia for the question on geography there. So I'd say generally, just a broader macro. We're seeing an ad market that we think is relatively stable versus last quarter. There are some puts and takes there. We're seeing real strength come from the retail vertical due to all the lower funnel improvements we've been building to drive performance there. And within that, sort of directly to your question on competitive positioning, we've talked about more than doubling the number of clicks to advertisers year-on-year; third straight quarter that we've done that. The value capture on that we've seen take hold first with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. As more and more advertisers are seeing that flow through into their measurement tools and seeing that remain consistent, we're seeing that now take hold with the next grouping of advertisers. So consistent with what we shared on prior calls, we're seeing that we're actually winning more and more of those performance budgets and always-on budgets, particularly with those larger advertisers in retail, and we're seeing that continue to be a real strength for us as we're driving more and more lower funnel performance. So we think we're positioned quite well there. And again, that's why we're seeing broad-based strength across retail. And we think there's more of that to go. I talked about how Performance+, as that comes out for that next tier of advertisers, that some of the hurdles they face to adopting more and more of our lower funnel performance solutions. Performance+, that actually automates so much of that for them around campaign creation and setup, and those various factors we think can help to further accelerate that adoption. And that's the place that we've known that some of the larger ad platforms have had those things for a while. And we've been competing on the high commercial intent of our platform, the uniqueness of being able to see what users are shopping for before they purchase. We've been competing on those things. Large, sophisticated advertisers have been seeing it. As we bring more of that automation, we think a broader swath of retailers are going to be able to lean in even more on that, and again, we've been seeing really good signals of that. We think there's more of that to come. So we feel really well positioned there. And I'd call out that we have other verticals where we're seeing strength as well, like technology, autos, financial services. And so that's giving you some of the competitive dynamic. And back to the macro on sort of the puts and takes, again, relatively stable overall, but we do have more exposure in certain categories given the use cases on Pinterest, such as food and beverage that Julia called out in her comments, where we've seen some weakness there. It's really industry-based. I think as many of those advertisers have been calling out in their own results, where they've been facing some pressure around some of what they are seeing from consumers. That's more specific to food and beverage. Broader than that, I think we see relative stability. Maybe with that, I'll pause. Julia, anything else you'd add on the macro or we can go to the other part of the question on geography.\nJulia Donnelly: Yeah, so I don't think anything else to add on the broader commentary there on the ad market overall. I think the only other kind of point I might add is in our rest of world segment. We did see a nice acceleration to 36% on a constant currency basis, up from 26% the prior quarter, albeit off a relatively small dollar base there. Revenue, the primary factor that drove this acceleration was the ramping of the Google third-party partnership that we announced in Q1, began to ramp in Q2. And as a reminder, that is allowing us to monetize what was previously unmonetized markets, and we're now also starting to expand into countries in our rest of world segment that we were under-monetized in. So we're pleased with how that's beginning to launch. Resellers are another lever to monetizing those regions. We launched these reseller partnerships in Q2, so that's still in early days, but we expect this to start to modestly contribute to the rest of world segment over the course of the next year as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRon Josey : Great. Thanks for the question. Bill, Julia, I wanted to maybe double-click a little bit more on the ad products that are coming out here, and specifically on the ad product that's out Direct Links. This is now, what, the third quarter in a row with clicks doubling again this quarter. So we'd love to hear just about the progress in terms of adoption amongst your advertiser base and then also how the sales process is going to discontinue the ramp over the coming quarters. And then with Performance+ coming online here, Bill, you talked about it being very well-received. We'd love to hear more about the rollout, specifically should we expect a similar timeline to Direct Links or perhaps would different modules roll out faster like Performance+, Creative coming out before Automation and things along those lines? Thanks for the help.\nBill Ready: Yeah, thanks for the question. So, on Direct Links, yes, the third quarter in a row of doubling clicks. We saw very quickly that the largest, most sophisticated advertisers, they are the ones that are able to respond to that very quickly. They've been driving really tremendous strength for us and continue to do so. We're seeing that start to broaden into the next tranche of retailers. That's also why we feel really good about sort of the ongoing dynamics in the business, is that we know we've generated really great raw material in terms of the clicks and conversions that we're sending to advertisers and a very significant increases of those year-on-year. But we also know that we've only yet captured the value from a portion of those, and the rest of those will continue to capture value from those as other retailers adopt measurement solutions. And now with Performance+, we're going to make it easier for them on campaign creation. And you know, I mentioned this in my remarks a little bit, and so I'll get to sort of the second part of your question around Performance+. For a lot of those less sophisticated advertisers, for them it's not just about their sophistication which we've talked about that in measurement and how it takes longer for them to see that, and they need to see it over multiple quarters. It's also about the work they have to do to go create a campaign and how you optimize creative across our platform and those kinds of things. And when you look at what we're doing with Performance+, it's really getting to how do you go create the setup of a campaign? How do you optimize the performance of that campaign? How do you match the creative to the audience? And then how might you further optimize that creative? And the more sophisticated advertisers, I think, do that really well on their own and where we think Performance+ can be additive, but they've been the first to sort of pick up on the increased clicks and conversions on the platform. For that next tranche, we think the fact that it becomes dramatically easier to set up a campaign, significantly easier to optimize creative to the different audiences, or even dynamically creative that will further optimize their click-through rates, we think that is going to really help that value capture to spread further. Now again, it's a multi-quarter rollout. Don't think of this as like a hockey stick. Just as with our other things, multi-quarter rollout, but that's again what gives us a lot of confidence in the ongoing momentum in the business and the steady build in that over a multi-quarter period. And the tangible examples of that, a few of which I mentioned in my comments, they are pretty real, right? Seeing 10% plus improvement in costs for advertisers in our alpha testing and our beta testing is quite encouraging. Like the examples I shared in the case studies like from Timberland a 34% lower CPA, 16% higher CTR, 50% higher ROAS that Timberland saw, these are really, really encouraging, and again, multi-quarter adoption curve, as we talked about before. But I think that's what gives us a lot of confidence that can really help that next tier of advertisers in the campaign setup. We're seeing things like 50% reduction in the number of steps required to go create a campaign on Pinterest. So I think it just holds with the broader theme that you've seen from us over the last two years. We're just consistently, we're making it easier and easier for more and more advertisers and more and more of the industry to do business with Pinterest. And so you've seen that every couple of quarters it has created a step function for us. And we think that as we look forward, it continues to bolster the ongoing strength in the business and very much consistent with what we talked about as we lined those initiatives out at our Investor Day last year for our multi-year review. Hopefully that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney : Thanks. I\u2019ll just ask about the 3P partnerships. You mentioned the contribution that Google made to rest of world. I know in the past you've said you expect the contribution to be greater in the June quarter than in the March quarter, and again and again greater in the September quarter than in the June quarter. How far do you think this \u2013 talk about like how long you think this takes to ramp or how long is the runway for ramping? Is this something that could build in absolute dollars for a year or two? Is there anything you can do to accelerate the, I guess, the performance of the 3P partnerships? And do you need to expand any more 3P partnerships? You've got two very large partners now in Amazon and Google. That may be good enough, but just talk about the opportunity to fill in beyond those two. Thank you very much.\nBill Ready: Yeah, thanks for the question, Mark. If you step back from it all, we're still relatively early days in what we're doing with 3P, right? We're a little bit more than a year in from when we first announced that, early \u201823. And we've seen Amazon ramping nicely, Google we're much earlier on with that as we announced them roughly a year after Amazon and that's starting to ramp as well. And so we continue to see each of those build as we shared in our commentary, that Q2 built off the baseline that we saw in Q1. We have similar expectations of that going forward, so we continue to see those things as a steady build. And we think there's a lot more opportunity not just with 3P, but in monetizing more of our platform. We really brought those in to round out gaps in our auction, in the markets where we were already monetized, and then to help us start monetizing in markets where we were completely unmonetized. And so we see that as something that we'll be optimizing for quarters and years to go. And with a lot more of that opportunity still in front of us, even as we still feel really good about the progress that we've made and the steady build of that on each of those partnerships.\nOperator: Our next question comes from\u2026 [Multiple Speakers]\nBill Ready: And then the other part of your question. Sorry Mark, I didn't hit the other part of your question about expanding those partnerships. While we don't have any more of those partnerships that we're talking about right now, we're going to continue to look for how we round out gaps in the auction. And maybe one final nugget I'll give is on our resellers. So as we talked about monetizing international, we talked about how that would be not just with 3P, but also with resellers. We're seeing those resellers start to ramp. We're early days in that. We're seeing them start to ramp and contribute. And we're actually seeing some synergies between the resellers and the 3P partnerships, where for some of those resellers, as they are bringing advertisers in, the fact that they can buy from us through Google Ads Manager where they already have an integration, is creating some synergy between the 3P and the resellers and the 1P business. As we think about advertisers that are still thinking about it directly, but now saying, you need your path to make that purchase through an existing integration. So again, feel really good about the progress. It continues to sort of build sequentially quarter-on-quarter, and we think there's a lot more of that ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is now open.\nRich Greenfield : Hi. Thanks for taking the question, Bill and Julia. You spent a tremendous amount of time improving the product at Pinterest, making it more useful and shopable as you talked about. I guess, we get a question, sort of why is that not translating into a meaningful acceleration in U.S. users? You're up a hair from where you ended last year, but given the product improvements, I guess what's the \u2013 how do we sort of reconcile those two things? Are you seeing a meaningful increase in time spent per U.S. user per week or per month, meaning you are seeing it more in engagement rather than overall growth in users? And sort of I know this is sort of a related question, but you keep talking about how younger users, I think since you joined, how younger users are your fastest growing segment. If overall users are relatively flattish, does that mean you are losing older users, meaning younger is replacing older? I just would love to understand sort of what's happening in terms of the overall mix of users would be great. Thanks.\nBill Ready: Yeah. Yeah, thanks Rich. So I've been pretty consistent on this from \u2013 since I got here, that in mature markets like the U.S., really the story was much more about growing depth of engagement with users. And to my comments earlier in the Q&A, we're seeing really, really encouraging signs there around depth of engagement. We've been talking about that consistently. We see that continue to happen with as I mentioned, the WAU to MAU ratio continuing to improve. And I think it's really noteworthy if you think about that. We're bringing on new users to the platform at record levels. And so normally when you are bringing on record levels of new users, that would be dilutive to your engagement per user, because new users may be somewhat more marginally engaged or more peripheral as you got your early adopters that were sort of your power users. The fact that we're not only bringing on record numbers of new users, but also deepening engagement for users while doing that, I think is exactly to that point of like, it's really about depth of engagement with users. And particularly, as I shared earlier in my commentary, we see that that depths of engagement is really occurring in exactly the ways that we wanted it to, where the curation signal that lets us help users through their shopping, help users navigate through their shopping during when they are deciding what to buy, we see the curation behaviors deepening. And then clicks is a major place that we see deepening, which as you know, had previously been a bit of an Achilles heel to the platform. That's now becoming a real strength for us where we're doubling the number of clicks we send to advertisers year-on-year, which just means more users are finding more of what they are looking for on the platform. So, all those things I think are very positive dynamics. And then to your specific question around, okay, if Gen Z is growing, are we losing others? I've shared this last quarter. It's true again this quarter, that we are growing across every demographic that we track and across every geography that we track. So our strength of users is really broad based and really directly tied to the improvements we've made to the platform around AI driven relevancy of recommendations and then the actionability and curation on the platform. Hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. When you think about all the ways you've improved the ad stack and your tools for advertisers, where do you see the biggest opportunity to close that gap between value creation and value capture? And it\u2019s how much visibility do you think you have in that shift, particularly in a potentially tougher macro environment? Thanks.\nBill Ready: I'd say on the visibility of it, like, we know it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking pretty consistently about, even if you're driving performance, it's only as good as what the advertisers are able to see and measure. So measurement has been a really big focus for us, continues to be. If you think about Pinterest, history as primarily more of an upper funnel platform. It would make sense that a lot of those advertisers hadn't implemented lower funnel measurement tools with us. It's really been \u2013 we're less than a year in with Direct Links. So less than a year into that, we've made really good progress in getting more advertisers to adopt that measurement, but we see a lot more of it ahead. And to your point of visibility, we're tracking it all the way down to the account level, and sales teams are not only looking at it account by account. Our sales reps have been trained on it, they are gold on it. So we feel like we've got pretty good visibility to what's driving that adoption, as well as responding to advertiser feedback of things that will make it easier for them to adopt, especially as you get to the smaller advertisers, where I talked about in my comments on the last couple calls, that we launched our API for conversions a little more than a year ago, and that's a really successful rollout with large advertisers. As we went to take that more broadly, we saw a need to meet advertisers where they were, integrate to the third party tools that they were using, clean rooms and the like. So you've heard us talking about more partnerships with third party measurement platforms, more partnerships with clean rooms. So as we're doing that, we're seeing that's really helping us make broad progress with retailers and advertisers, particularly lower funnel advertisers that are making it easier for them to adopt the measurement so they can see the value. When they see that come through in their measurement, then we see them shifting budgets, and we think there's a lot more of that ahead. Then finally on Performance+, there's the other side of that, which is just the campaign creation and the creative optimization, where if you think about Pinterest as a smaller player in the overall ad market, if you go to some of these advertisers and say, \u2018oh well, hey, if you implement measurement with us, and if you do some campaign setup, we can drive good performance for you, but we're low single digit percentage points of your total spend.\u2019 That's a harder conversation to get people to adopt. Well, now we're able to point to the fact that we have the largest, most sophisticated advertisers getting really great performance from us. We're getting into their always on budgets, their performance budgets. I shared in our last call, getting the 5%, 10% of ad spend for some of these really large, sophisticated retailers. As we're now able to point to that and say, not only can you have that kind of performance, but we're making it easier for you to measure, because we're integrating to your measurement tools, and now with Performance+, we're going to solve the other side of this and make it easier for your campaign creation and campaign optimization and creative optimization. We think these are all things that are responding to that advertiser feedback, that we've been getting account-by-account, and making it so that we have clear line of sight to that value capture continuing to play out, even though it's still something to think about over a multi-quarter period. Hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon : Great. Good afternoon, everybody. Julia, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment about the lower eCPMs from third parties. As you noted, these are smaller, under-monetized markets that we're starting to step into, so that's not a big surprise. But is that pricing coming in, sort of in line with your expectations so far? And then just second, do you feel I can follow-up just a little bit on Performance+? It sounds like you're starting to get into that next tranche already. Do you think that that next tranche will really have given it a solid test drive ahead of holiday season when your retail vertical will be extra important? Thank you.\nBill Ready: Yeah, maybe I'll take the last one first. I think that we've seen that continue to be a steady build, and so we think that progress in retail, we thought it as one of our primary sources of strength, we see that continue to build. And Performance+, it's early on, it's multi-quarter, but we've seen it start with the largest, most sophisticated retailers and advertisers. Then we started to hit the next group down. We think Performance+ will start to take it further down even than that. But we think that sets us up well as we look into the future and look to continue that steady build within retail.\nJulia Donnelly: Yeah. I think on the first part of your question though, on eCPMs, and so yes, it is generally coming in line with sort of where we expected for those rest of world markets that just have a lower eCPM. I do think over time as we continue to ramp those partnerships and add even more option density in those markets, we can expect those eCPMs to rise. But based on where we are right now and based on the fact that they are just sort of lower TAM markets overall, we feel really pleased with sort of how those are initially ramping.\nBill Ready: All right. I think that's our...\nAndrew Somberg : I think that's our last question, operator.\nBill Ready : All right. Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll be discussing our second quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary third quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Let's dive into our second quarter results. We ended the quarter with 522 million global monthly active users, or MAUs, growing 12% and reaching another record high. Users continued to grow year-over-year across all of our geographic regions due to the compounding effects of the initiatives Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks, where improved personalization, curation, and actionability are driving enhanced inspiration to action journeys for users. Specifically, in Q2, in the U.S. and Canada, we had 98 million MAUs growing 3%. In Europe, we had 136 million MAUs growing 9%, and in our rest of world markets, we had 288 million MAUs growing 17%. Now on to revenue. In Q2, our global revenue was $854 million, up 21% on a reported and constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel with particular strength coming from our lowest funnel conversion objective. From a vertical perspective, we once again saw broad strength in retail. Our larger, more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform as they have adopted our lower funnel tools and are seeing continued success. We're also starting to see signs of value capture from the next tranche of advertisers as we have doubled clicks for the third quarter in a row and those advertisers are beginning to see that impact in their measurement sources of truth and adjusting spending accordingly. Additionally, emerging verticals like technology, autos, and financial services were sources of strength. However, this growth was partially offset by softness within CPG, specifically food and beverage advertisers, who are navigating broader headwinds within that category. Next, as expected, revenue from our third-party demand partnerships continued to ramp in Q2, growing sequentially off the revenue base we delivered in Q1 as it continues to complement our growing first-party business. Turning to our geographical breakouts for Q2. In the U.S. and Canada, we generated $673 million in revenue, growing 19%. Strength came from retail and from emerging categories, including technology, autos, and financial services. In Europe, revenue was $143 million, growing 25% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Strength in Europe was driven by retail. Revenue from the rest of the world was $38 million, growing 32% on a reported basis or 36% on a constant currency basis. In Q2, ad impressions grew 35% while ad pricing declined 11% year-over-year. These dynamics were similar to Q1, with ad impressions being driven both by increases in total impressions as well as increases in ad load. Similarly, pricing continues to be lower year-over-year as we continue to drive increased value to advertisers in the form of more clicks and greater efficiency. We continue to drive increases in ad load through whole-page optimization, which increases the supply of relevant ads to users in moments of high commercial intent, and we see opportunity to increase ad load moving forward as we further improve the actionability of our users' journeys and the relevance of our ads. In Q2, we also saw a greater mix shift to ad impressions with lower average pricing, or eCPMs. This was influenced by two factors. First, we started serving ads in previously unmonetized markets, mostly in our rest of world region, many of which have lower eCPMs than our existing monetized markets. And second, on a global basis, we are seeing growth in third-party ad impressions to fill in gaps in our auction in places that were previously under-monetized or not monetized at all. Right now, we are mainly filling these in with relevant demand from third parties, but over time as we increase demand further, we expect to see greater auction pressure and therefore higher eCPMs for these ad flocks. Moving to expenses. For the past several quarters, we've been able to drive continued margin expansion through effective expense discipline by allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. In Q2, cost of revenue was $180 million, up 9% year-over-year, and up 2% versus Q1, due to increased infrastructure spend related to user and engagement growth and partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $497 million, up 13%. The increase was primarily driven by headcount growth and R&D, increased marketing expense, and increased G&A driven by non-income based taxes and other employee-related costs. Our revenue strength and expense discipline led to another solid quarter of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, coming in at $180 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%. This was up approximately 600 basis points versus Q2 last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. In Q2, we utilized approximately $120 million of cash on net share settlement of equity awards, plus an additional $34 million on share repurchases. Now I'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the third quarter. We expect Q3, 2024 revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $900 million, representing 16% to 18% growth year-over-year. Let me share some additional context as we look forward to Q3. Our revenue guidance reflects further progress against our strategic initiatives, including continued lower funnel strength and the ongoing emerging contribution from third-party demand partnerships. The underlying health of our business remains strong, and we continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead. However, as we move into Q3, we are facing tougher comps since our revenue growth nearly doubled from Q2 to Q3 last year. It is also worth noting that at current spot rates, we are expecting a foreign exchange to move against us for the first time in five quarters, resulting in a 1 point headwind for Q3. Finally, our guidance does not assume a material improvement in trend for the food and beverage category or significant revenue contribution from the launch of Performance+, as we are still currently in the testing phase with a small number of advertisers. Turning now to our expense guidance. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $485 million to $500 million, growing 17% to 20% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to realize modest additional benefits from our ongoing infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore we anticipate Q3 non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q2. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we continue to invest in headcount for AI talent across our business. As we have said previously, for full year 2024, we are anticipating year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023, as we balance investing in growth and flowing profitability through to the bottom line. We also continue to expect margin expansion in both halves of 2024. So, consistent with our prior remarks, we expect a more modest level of margin expansion in the second half versus significantly higher expansion in the first half, as we begin to lap the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. In closing, I'm proud of our team for delivering yet another strong quarter of results as we execute against our strategic plans. Our continued gains are evidence of the momentum in our business and underpin our confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans. Now, I'll hand it over to Bill for some final words. Great. Thanks, Ross. So, we feel good about the levers to drive our business. Our initiatives are trending consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day. The products we put in market are doing exactly what we've intended for them to do. Looking to Q3, our guidance is a continuation of many of the factors that have helped drive growth in Q1, Q2, and now into Q3, including value capture from lower funnel products and third-party demand growing off the Q2 revenue base again. And we noted in the prepared remarks that we expect FX to switch to a one-point headwind for us at current spot rates. And so, the 16% to 18% guidance for Q3 would have effectively been one point higher without this FX headwind. That higher range, excluding the FX impact, is roughly consistent with the growth we've drove in Q2 and Q1 this year, particularly when accounting for some of the unique seasonal factors that benefited Q1 that we highlighted on our prior earnings call, including the Easter timing shift and leap day. So, the underlying growth rate of the business is holding effectively stable, despite the fact that our comps last year did start to become more difficult in Q3, and the fact that we're experiencing further softness in food and beverage. And if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, you'll see that strength persist as well. And then lastly, as some of you may remember, it's worth noting that we do not accept political ads, so that's a difference to account for as you compare us to other platforms as well. Yeah. So maybe just to share a little bit more color. Previously we measured engagement as sessions longer than 60 seconds, impressions and saves. And as Bill talked about, we've evolved our platform to be more actionable, and we've updated our view of engagement to include some of these additional dimensions that are also important signals of depth of engagement, including things like measuring outbound clicks and looking at curation signals like collage creation, for example, which is a newer feature on our platform. So as Bill mentioned, overall engagement signals remain strong, and we're also seeing this exciting shift that outbound clicks are becoming a more meaningful part of user behavior, as users are able to find what they are looking for more quickly. And we believe this is a healthy evolution of the platform, and it's also kind of better aligned with the value we're providing advertisers since we sell ads across the full funnel on a views, clicks and conversions basis. Yeah, so I don't think anything else to add on the broader commentary there on the ad market overall. I think the only other kind of point I might add is in our rest of world segment. We did see a nice acceleration to 36% on a constant currency basis, up from 26% the prior quarter, albeit off a relatively small dollar base there. Revenue, the primary factor that drove this acceleration was the ramping of the Google third-party partnership that we announced in Q1, began to ramp in Q2. And as a reminder, that is allowing us to monetize what was previously unmonetized markets, and we're now also starting to expand into countries in our rest of world segment that we were under-monetized in. So we're pleased with how that's beginning to launch. Resellers are another lever to monetizing those regions. We launched these reseller partnerships in Q2, so that's still in early days, but we expect this to start to modestly contribute to the rest of world segment over the course of the next year as well. Yeah. I think on the first part of your question though, on eCPMs, and so yes, it is generally coming in line with sort of where we expected for those rest of world markets that just have a lower eCPM. I do think over time as we continue to ramp those partnerships and add even more option density in those markets, we can expect those eCPMs to rise. But based on where we are right now and based on the fact that they are just sort of lower TAM markets overall, we feel really pleased with sort of how those are initially ramping."

            "name": "Bill Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Q2 marked another strong quarter of growth in users and revenue, driven by continued progress against our strategic initiatives. On the user side, we're leaning into what our users love most about Pinterest, the ability to find inspiration and take action seamlessly in one platform. And as we've said before, we found our best product market fit in years. Q2 global MAUs reached another record high of $522 million, growing 12% year-over-year. On the monetization side, our investments to become a true full-funnel platform, particularly our efforts to build out our lower funnel offerings, are paying off with Q2 revenue of $854 million, up 21% year-over-year. We also continue to drive significant improvements in profitability, resulting in Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $180 million or a 21% margin, up 600 basis points versus Q2 last year. Before I dive into my usual business update, I wanted to start with a few anecdotes from my time last month at Cannes Lions, one of the largest advertising industry events of the year, as it reflects the momentum building around Pinterest. Advertisers are taking note of Gen Z love for Pinterest and are increasingly understanding how they can meet this audience on our platform across their inspiration to action journey. They are also seeing firsthand how our investments in the lower funnel are driving tangible success through our increased clicks and conversions. And this momentum was evident at Cannes, as we saw a 50% increase in the number of visits to our activation this year and a 40% increase in the number of advertisers we met with at this important event. While at Cannes, we created an immersive activation experience where attendees could discover user behavior on Pinterest firsthand, and what one CEO said felt like stepping into a real-life inspiration board. We created a space where attendees, many of whom were Gen Z, could take a break from talking and hearing about creativity and actually be creative with Pinterest. We also previewed our latest AI and automation tools to drive even more performance for our advertisers through the launch of Performance+, which was very well received. I'll discuss more about Performance+ later in my remarks. Shifting now to our quarterly update, beginning with users and engagement, last quarter, we reviewed the initiatives over the last two years that have taken us from declining users to sustained user growth. These initiatives are: one, utilizing AI to drive increased relevance and personalization; two, doubling down on curation through boards and collages to help users navigate their inspiration to action journey; three, increasing actionability, particularly for shopping, allowing our users to bring their inspiration to life; and four, creating a more positive alternative to traditional social media. When combined, these initiatives have had compounding effects and have led to the healthy MAU growth we're seeing today across all geographic regions and the age cohorts we track. Now, I'll share more about the key recent product launches that demonstrate continued progress against our strategy and the initiatives that I've outlined. First, we're helping our users more effectively find inspiration and discover new, relevant content that resonates with their interests through our investments in AI. We've made ongoing progress to modernize the core AI that powers the content users are shown, leading to meaningful improvements to the relevance and personalization of our content recommendations. As an example, in Q2, we upgraded our search ranking algorithm to incorporate new signals, enabling us to recommend more relevant and ultimately engaging content for the user. This resulted in a significant increase in our global search fulfillment rate, which means our users are finding more of what they are looking for when they search on Pinterest. A part of our efforts to improve content discovery is to help users refine their searches, which often start as short, broad queries, as users come to us with a general sense of what they are looking for, but don't have the precise words to describe it or will know it when they see it. We're continuing to invest in bolstering content discovery through Generative AI-based guided search, which we first rolled out several months ago for the Home Decor vertical. Guided search provides a structured way to break down these broad queries into narrower avenues of exploration. For example, a search for a broad query like kitchen ideas might lead a user to more refined options like DIY kitchen projects or Backsplash Inspiration to further explore their taste and move down the inspiration to action journey. We're finding a notably strong product user fit for guided search with our more episodic users, who are generally less familiar with the platform and thus find value in the structured experience to discover fulfilling results. Second, we're leaning into curation, a key differentiating feature of Pinterest and one that users leverage as a pivotal step to navigate their journey from inspiration to action. Said simply, it's how they refine their choices and decide what to buy. Human curation on the platform bolsters our content flywheel, providing rich first-party signals early in customer shopping journeys. These signals are predictive of user interests and allow us to drive even more relevance to users via enhanced content recommendations. We've been reinvesting in making the curation journey on Pinterest easier to use and more engaging for our users through updates to boards and through our new content format, collages. On the board side, it's more intuitive to create, save to, and share boards than ever, with a refined user interface and new features like auto-organization that utilizes AI to identify and automatically group together pins into new boards, saving users the need to organize it themselves. We're also making it easier for users to share their taste and style with others. In Q2, we launched Board Sharing, a new feature allowing users to share engaging videos of their Pinterest boards, like Dream Home Decor or Ultimate Travel Bucket List, to other social platforms for the first time. This feature also enables us to include a link for others to explore their boards on a platform as well. We're also collaborating with power users like musician Avril Lavigne, who used board sharing to give her fans a sneak peek into the inspiration behind her tour outfits to bring this feature to life for a broader audience and showcase the magic of curation on Pinterest. We're continuing to make progress with collages, a highly interactive new content format developed using advanced computer vision technology, which allows users to cut out components like a shirt or a pair of shoes from other images and piece them together into one highly engaging and interactive pin. And as we've mentioned before, we're seeing that this content format resonates with our audience, who save collages roughly three times more often than our traditional pins, especially with our Gen Z audience who uses collages to express their personal aesthetic. In Q2, we extended collages to advertisers, meaning they can now create engaging collages using cutouts of product pins from their own catalog and promote them as ads. In fact, brands like Nike, John Lewis, and Bumble and Bumble are utilizing collages to showcase their product catalog in a unique and visually appealing way. And finally, we're driving further actionability across Pinterest by launching features that allow users to move further along in their shopping journeys and take action on what they see. In doing so, we more than doubled the number of outbound clicks we sent to advertisers year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. And as we improve overall actionability and make it easier for users to find what they're looking for, we're seeing that users are able to successfully complete their journeys on Pinterest more quickly. In Q2, we ship more new filters like price, retailer, and brand on high shopping intent search queries across fashion and home decor verticals. We're also experimenting with other filters, including on sale, to give users more control over their shopping journeys and find products tailored to their style and budget. And with this valuable signal, we can then recommend even more relevant and personalized shoppable content to our users. We're also making video more shoppable on the platform, as it is an integral content format on the inspiration to action journey. As an example, in Q1, we launched Shop to Look on Video to help users shop items that bring them inspiration in the videos they were already watching. In Q2, we introduced video shopping ads to complement all the work we've been doing to drive actionability across formats and surfaces. With video shopping ads, merchants can seamlessly add videos to their product catalogs on Pinterest and promote them. Hundreds of advertisers have already started incorporating video in their product catalogs, given the strong visual nature of our platform. For mass retailers who have adopted this format, shoppable video ads drove a higher click-through rate and lower cost per action compared to static catalog ads. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable and performant for advertisers. We delivered strong revenue growth in Q2, and the momentum we're driving in the business is evidence of all the work we've been doing over the last several quarters to significantly improve our ad offering, as the initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day continue to deliver as we expected or better. This includes; one, our investments to become a true full funnel ad platform, particularly through our new lower funnel offerings, which are creating significant value for advertisers; two, continuing to increase ad load driven by the synergies between our users' strong commercial intent and relevant ads; and lastly, third-party partners, resellers, and international as additional levers to revenue growth. We're seeing advertisers take notice of the growing momentum in our business, and we're gaining share with some of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world. As I look ahead, there's a lot more to do, but it is clear that the strategy we've employed is working. Shifting to our full funnel ad solutions, we've been hard at work improving our offering to help advertisers meet consumers across the full funnel. Pinterest is a place where advertisers can build their brand in a positive environment, drive consideration when the consumer is not yet decided, and ultimately deliver conversions all on one platform. We see that over 90% of search queries don't specify a brand or specific product, but rather a categorical interest, such as Fun Summer Dresses or Cool White Sneakers or Mid-Century Bedroom Decor. This is a magic moment for advertisers to connect with users who have clear commercial intent, but have not yet decided what they want to buy. Many of our advertisers are taking advantage of the full funnel, with over half of our large advertisers using multiple campaign objectives. Moreover, advertisers who use upper and lower funnel objectives see two times higher conversion rates than those who use one objective alone. Within the full funnel, we focus the majority of our monetization efforts on the lower funnel to drive performance in the form of clicks and conversions to advertisers. We've made substantial progress across our entire platform to improve actionability and allow users to shop at the point of inspiration. Nowhere does this manifest more than within the lower funnel, where relevant shoppable ads can be great content on Pinterest. And whole page optimization, powered by AI, allows us to show more of these relevant shoppable ads when users are in moments of high commercial intent. Over the last year, we've also made significant progress in making the purchase journey more seamless for our users, with products like Mobile Deeplinking and Direct Links. Now, nearly 100% of our lower funnel revenue is covered by Direct Links or Mobile Deeplinking, which means it takes just one click to lead the user directly to an advertiser's product or purchase page. The changes we've made are having real impacts, as we've now more than doubled the amount of clicks to advertisers year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. As advertisers have begun to notice improvements in their measurement sources of truth, many of the largest, most sophisticated advertisers are voting with their dollars and driving more budget to Pinterest. We're beginning to see value capture from the next tranche of advertisers as well and believe much of the value capture from Direct Links is still ahead of us, as advertisers continue to take note of the consistent increase in click volume we are delivering. However, the pace at which advertisers adjust their budgets depends on a variety of factors, including seeing this performance appear in their individual measurement sources of truth and the level of resourcing required to implement incremental campaigns. We anticipate that with the rollout of our new automation suite, Performance+, which I'll discuss shortly in more detail, we'll be able to alleviate some of this heavy lifting on the advertiser's side. This should drive even greater value creation through improved campaign setup and efficiency, leading to compounding performance effects through our full lower funnel solution set and ultimately further value capture. Finally, we're also continuing to drive more actionability in the lower funnel through incorporating third-party ads into our auction to grow relevant shoppable ad demand. As we expected, third-party ad demand became an even larger source of revenue this quarter and is continuing to fill in gaps in the auction, especially on our high-intent surfaces like search and related items where relevant ads are additive shoppable content for our users. We know that performance is only as good as the advertiser's ability to measure it. Because of this, we're focused on driving adoption of our privacy-centric measurement tools like Conversions API and Clean Rooms. We continue to grow adoption of these tools in Q2 with a sharp focus on advertisers with lower funnel shopping and conversion objectives. This adoption has been driven by a few key initiatives. First, we are easing the onboarding process for advertisers with the goal of meeting advertisers where they are with whichever third-party solutions they are using. As such, we revamped our developer site and continue to increase the number of third-party integration partnerships. Second, we have bolstered our own seller training efforts and education to help advertisers understand how these solutions can strengthen their conversion visibility. With that, we continue to make measurement adoption a key priority for our sales force and tie a portion of seller incentive compensation to privacy-centric measurement adoption. While we want advertisers to adopt our own solutions and best practices, we recognize that many of them have their own measurement source of truth. To that end, we focused our efforts on making sure we are showing up correctly and consistently wherever an advertiser measures their performance. Moving to AI and automation, our work to build out our lower funnel suite continued in Q2 with the announcement of Performance+. This brand-new offering, which recently entered beta for a limited number of advertisers, brings together all of our AI and automation tools across bidding, budgeting, and targeting to improve campaign performance on Pinterest. With Performance+, lower funnel advertisers can use these tools in concert to unlock our most powerful automation and AI features, all within a new simplified campaign setup. Advertisers can also apply any of these features to non-Performance+ campaigns, giving them the ultimate control based on their unique needs. We are excited about Performance+ as the next iteration of our lower funnel suite. As we roll out these tools, we expect a similar multi-quarter product uptake and adoption curve as our previous lower funnel launches, like shopping ads, Mobile Deeplinking and Direct Links, and Conversions APIs. This suite of tools, when used together, compound upon each other to drive powerful lower funnel performance for our advertisers. While still early, the test results have been positive. Many of the advertisers who participated in our Performance+ Alpha test this spring saw a greater than 10% improvement in cost per acquisition for their lower funnel conversion and shopping ad campaigns, or a greater than 10% improvement in cost per click, CPC, for consideration campaigns. For example, outdoor apparel brand Timberland was an early tester of Performance+ in the UK, and saw a 34% lower cost per action, a 16% increase in click-through rate, and ultimately a 50% higher return on ad spend from their Performance+ enabled campaign versus their traditional campaigns. In addition, Performance+ significantly reduces the time required for advertisers to create a campaign, with 50% fewer inputs than a traditional creation flow. We are also testing additional automation solutions, which we plan to incorporate into the Performance+ suite in the coming months. These include Performance+ bidding for ROAS, which automatically optimizes advertisers' bids to drive the highest ROI, and Performance+ creative, which helps advertisers make new ad creative using Generative AI and optimize their existing creative across multiple ad formats. Performance+ creative is already driving tangible results for advertisers. Fashion marketplace Poshmark, an early tester of the product, saw a 25% lift in click-through rates on products with a Performance+ generative background versus a white background. As we continue to iterate, we will roll these features out to a broader swath of lower funnel advertisers, and we'll have more to share as we progress through the second half of the year. Overall, I'm proud of our latest automation rollout, a continuation of our efforts to deliver the best possible performance for advertisers and reduce friction in doing so. Our goal is for advertisers to be able to provide us with a budget, a goal, and their Seed Creative, and we'll do the rest. With that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance. Thanks Julia. I want to thank our team at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Great. Thanks for the question. I'd say engagement continues to be a real highlight for us overall. The general trend of not only accelerating user growth, and you saw us put up 12% user growth overall, not only is that holding, this general trend of engagement per user deepening is also continuing to hold. So Play seems to see that clearly. It's really in the steady improvement in our WAU to MAU ratio in 2024, even as we bring in record amounts of new users. So if you pull back the covers on that, and this will get a little bit more to your question on some of the different dynamics of Play. You pull back the covers on that, there's some really exciting things happening with the way that users are engaging. As we've been driving improvements in curation and actionability, we're seeing more and more clicks and conversions from users. This is really great for users, because it means they are finding more of what they are looking for on Pinterest, and it's great for advertisers, because they see clicks and conversions as much more valuable than impressions. And to your comment around ad load, we've been talking about ads as great content for users, particularly when they are in a commercial context, and those ads are relevant to what they are looking for. So we continue to see that synergistic dynamic there, because we have more than half our users on the platform to shop. So that's been a real lever for us. We think it continues to be. And so back to engagement, we track a number of engagement metrics, and we continue to see nice growth in engagement across the platform, measured by the various signals there. But with clicks and lower funnel behavior becoming a more meaningful part of that mix, which again is really encouraging. We're also seeing deeper penetration with our mobile app users who tend to be more sticky and highly engaged users. And finally, I'll just call out that we've added more of that highly desirable lower funnel behavior as we've seen that from our users. We're adding that more into how we're measuring success for the business, for our teams, and in how we are continuing to enhance that flywheel on synergistic effect between ads as great content for users that are in commercial context. Maybe I'll pause there. And Julie, anything you'd add to that? Great. Maybe I'll start with the second one first, and then give it to Julia for the question on geography there. So I'd say generally, just a broader macro. We're seeing an ad market that we think is relatively stable versus last quarter. There are some puts and takes there. We're seeing real strength come from the retail vertical due to all the lower funnel improvements we've been building to drive performance there. And within that, sort of directly to your question on competitive positioning, we've talked about more than doubling the number of clicks to advertisers year-on-year; third straight quarter that we've done that. The value capture on that we've seen take hold first with the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. As more and more advertisers are seeing that flow through into their measurement tools and seeing that remain consistent, we're seeing that now take hold with the next grouping of advertisers. So consistent with what we shared on prior calls, we're seeing that we're actually winning more and more of those performance budgets and always-on budgets, particularly with those larger advertisers in retail, and we're seeing that continue to be a real strength for us as we're driving more and more lower funnel performance. So we think we're positioned quite well there. And again, that's why we're seeing broad-based strength across retail. And we think there's more of that to go. I talked about how Performance+, as that comes out for that next tier of advertisers, that some of the hurdles they face to adopting more and more of our lower funnel performance solutions. Performance+, that actually automates so much of that for them around campaign creation and setup, and those various factors we think can help to further accelerate that adoption. And that's the place that we've known that some of the larger ad platforms have had those things for a while. And we've been competing on the high commercial intent of our platform, the uniqueness of being able to see what users are shopping for before they purchase. We've been competing on those things. Large, sophisticated advertisers have been seeing it. As we bring more of that automation, we think a broader swath of retailers are going to be able to lean in even more on that, and again, we've been seeing really good signals of that. We think there's more of that to come. So we feel really well positioned there. And I'd call out that we have other verticals where we're seeing strength as well, like technology, autos, financial services. And so that's giving you some of the competitive dynamic. And back to the macro on sort of the puts and takes, again, relatively stable overall, but we do have more exposure in certain categories given the use cases on Pinterest, such as food and beverage that Julia called out in her comments, where we've seen some weakness there. It's really industry-based. I think as many of those advertisers have been calling out in their own results, where they've been facing some pressure around some of what they are seeing from consumers. That's more specific to food and beverage. Broader than that, I think we see relative stability. Maybe with that, I'll pause. Julia, anything else you'd add on the macro or we can go to the other part of the question on geography. Yeah, thanks for the question. So, on Direct Links, yes, the third quarter in a row of doubling clicks. We saw very quickly that the largest, most sophisticated advertisers, they are the ones that are able to respond to that very quickly. They've been driving really tremendous strength for us and continue to do so. We're seeing that start to broaden into the next tranche of retailers. That's also why we feel really good about sort of the ongoing dynamics in the business, is that we know we've generated really great raw material in terms of the clicks and conversions that we're sending to advertisers and a very significant increases of those year-on-year. But we also know that we've only yet captured the value from a portion of those, and the rest of those will continue to capture value from those as other retailers adopt measurement solutions. And now with Performance+, we're going to make it easier for them on campaign creation. And you know, I mentioned this in my remarks a little bit, and so I'll get to sort of the second part of your question around Performance+. For a lot of those less sophisticated advertisers, for them it's not just about their sophistication which we've talked about that in measurement and how it takes longer for them to see that, and they need to see it over multiple quarters. It's also about the work they have to do to go create a campaign and how you optimize creative across our platform and those kinds of things. And when you look at what we're doing with Performance+, it's really getting to how do you go create the setup of a campaign? How do you optimize the performance of that campaign? How do you match the creative to the audience? And then how might you further optimize that creative? And the more sophisticated advertisers, I think, do that really well on their own and where we think Performance+ can be additive, but they've been the first to sort of pick up on the increased clicks and conversions on the platform. For that next tranche, we think the fact that it becomes dramatically easier to set up a campaign, significantly easier to optimize creative to the different audiences, or even dynamically creative that will further optimize their click-through rates, we think that is going to really help that value capture to spread further. Now again, it's a multi-quarter rollout. Don't think of this as like a hockey stick. Just as with our other things, multi-quarter rollout, but that's again what gives us a lot of confidence in the ongoing momentum in the business and the steady build in that over a multi-quarter period. And the tangible examples of that, a few of which I mentioned in my comments, they are pretty real, right? Seeing 10% plus improvement in costs for advertisers in our alpha testing and our beta testing is quite encouraging. Like the examples I shared in the case studies like from Timberland a 34% lower CPA, 16% higher CTR, 50% higher ROAS that Timberland saw, these are really, really encouraging, and again, multi-quarter adoption curve, as we talked about before. But I think that's what gives us a lot of confidence that can really help that next tier of advertisers in the campaign setup. We're seeing things like 50% reduction in the number of steps required to go create a campaign on Pinterest. So I think it just holds with the broader theme that you've seen from us over the last two years. We're just consistently, we're making it easier and easier for more and more advertisers and more and more of the industry to do business with Pinterest. And so you've seen that every couple of quarters it has created a step function for us. And we think that as we look forward, it continues to bolster the ongoing strength in the business and very much consistent with what we talked about as we lined those initiatives out at our Investor Day last year for our multi-year review. Hopefully that helps. Yeah, thanks for the question, Mark. If you step back from it all, we're still relatively early days in what we're doing with 3P, right? We're a little bit more than a year in from when we first announced that, early \u201823. And we've seen Amazon ramping nicely, Google we're much earlier on with that as we announced them roughly a year after Amazon and that's starting to ramp as well. And so we continue to see each of those build as we shared in our commentary, that Q2 built off the baseline that we saw in Q1. We have similar expectations of that going forward, so we continue to see those things as a steady build. And we think there's a lot more opportunity not just with 3P, but in monetizing more of our platform. We really brought those in to round out gaps in our auction, in the markets where we were already monetized, and then to help us start monetizing in markets where we were completely unmonetized. And so we see that as something that we'll be optimizing for quarters and years to go. And with a lot more of that opportunity still in front of us, even as we still feel really good about the progress that we've made and the steady build of that on each of those partnerships. And then the other part of your question. Sorry Mark, I didn't hit the other part of your question about expanding those partnerships. While we don't have any more of those partnerships that we're talking about right now, we're going to continue to look for how we round out gaps in the auction. And maybe one final nugget I'll give is on our resellers. So as we talked about monetizing international, we talked about how that would be not just with 3P, but also with resellers. We're seeing those resellers start to ramp. We're early days in that. We're seeing them start to ramp and contribute. And we're actually seeing some synergies between the resellers and the 3P partnerships, where for some of those resellers, as they are bringing advertisers in, the fact that they can buy from us through Google Ads Manager where they already have an integration, is creating some synergy between the 3P and the resellers and the 1P business. As we think about advertisers that are still thinking about it directly, but now saying, you need your path to make that purchase through an existing integration. So again, feel really good about the progress. It continues to sort of build sequentially quarter-on-quarter, and we think there's a lot more of that ahead of us. Yeah. Yeah, thanks Rich. So I've been pretty consistent on this from \u2013 since I got here, that in mature markets like the U.S., really the story was much more about growing depth of engagement with users. And to my comments earlier in the Q&A, we're seeing really, really encouraging signs there around depth of engagement. We've been talking about that consistently. We see that continue to happen with as I mentioned, the WAU to MAU ratio continuing to improve. And I think it's really noteworthy if you think about that. We're bringing on new users to the platform at record levels. And so normally when you are bringing on record levels of new users, that would be dilutive to your engagement per user, because new users may be somewhat more marginally engaged or more peripheral as you got your early adopters that were sort of your power users. The fact that we're not only bringing on record numbers of new users, but also deepening engagement for users while doing that, I think is exactly to that point of like, it's really about depth of engagement with users. And particularly, as I shared earlier in my commentary, we see that that depths of engagement is really occurring in exactly the ways that we wanted it to, where the curation signal that lets us help users through their shopping, help users navigate through their shopping during when they are deciding what to buy, we see the curation behaviors deepening. And then clicks is a major place that we see deepening, which as you know, had previously been a bit of an Achilles heel to the platform. That's now becoming a real strength for us where we're doubling the number of clicks we send to advertisers year-on-year, which just means more users are finding more of what they are looking for on the platform. So, all those things I think are very positive dynamics. And then to your specific question around, okay, if Gen Z is growing, are we losing others? I've shared this last quarter. It's true again this quarter, that we are growing across every demographic that we track and across every geography that we track. So our strength of users is really broad based and really directly tied to the improvements we've made to the platform around AI driven relevancy of recommendations and then the actionability and curation on the platform. Hope that helps. I'd say on the visibility of it, like, we know it's \u2013 we've been talking pretty consistently about, even if you're driving performance, it's only as good as what the advertisers are able to see and measure. So measurement has been a really big focus for us, continues to be. If you think about Pinterest, history as primarily more of an upper funnel platform. It would make sense that a lot of those advertisers hadn't implemented lower funnel measurement tools with us. It's really been \u2013 we're less than a year in with Direct Links. So less than a year into that, we've made really good progress in getting more advertisers to adopt that measurement, but we see a lot more of it ahead. And to your point of visibility, we're tracking it all the way down to the account level, and sales teams are not only looking at it account by account. Our sales reps have been trained on it, they are gold on it. So we feel like we've got pretty good visibility to what's driving that adoption, as well as responding to advertiser feedback of things that will make it easier for them to adopt, especially as you get to the smaller advertisers, where I talked about in my comments on the last couple calls, that we launched our API for conversions a little more than a year ago, and that's a really successful rollout with large advertisers. As we went to take that more broadly, we saw a need to meet advertisers where they were, integrate to the third party tools that they were using, clean rooms and the like. So you've heard us talking about more partnerships with third party measurement platforms, more partnerships with clean rooms. So as we're doing that, we're seeing that's really helping us make broad progress with retailers and advertisers, particularly lower funnel advertisers that are making it easier for them to adopt the measurement so they can see the value. When they see that come through in their measurement, then we see them shifting budgets, and we think there's a lot more of that ahead. Then finally on Performance+, there's the other side of that, which is just the campaign creation and the creative optimization, where if you think about Pinterest as a smaller player in the overall ad market, if you go to some of these advertisers and say, \u2018oh well, hey, if you implement measurement with us, and if you do some campaign setup, we can drive good performance for you, but we're low single digit percentage points of your total spend.' That's a harder conversation to get people to adopt. Well, now we're able to point to the fact that we have the largest, most sophisticated advertisers getting really great performance from us. We're getting into their always on budgets, their performance budgets. I shared in our last call, getting the 5%, 10% of ad spend for some of these really large, sophisticated retailers. As we're now able to point to that and say, not only can you have that kind of performance, but we're making it easier for you to measure, because we're integrating to your measurement tools, and now with Performance+, we're going to solve the other side of this and make it easier for your campaign creation and campaign optimization and creative optimization. We think these are all things that are responding to that advertiser feedback, that we've been getting account-by-account, and making it so that we have clear line of sight to that value capture continuing to play out, even though it's still something to think about over a multi-quarter period. Hope that helps. Yeah, maybe I'll take the last one first. I think that we've seen that continue to be a steady build, and so we think that progress in retail, we thought it as one of our primary sources of strength, we see that continue to build. And Performance+, it's early on, it's multi-quarter, but we've seen it start with the largest, most sophisticated retailers and advertisers. Then we started to hit the next group down. We think Performance+ will start to take it further down even than that. But we think that sets us up well as we look into the future and look to continue that steady build within retail. All right. I think that's our... All right. Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping this dialogue going. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. In Q1, we accelerated our progress against our strategic priorities, growing users and engagement, creating value for our advertisers through our lower funnel solutions, and continuing to deliver profitable growth through operational efficiency. Investing in our core differentiators has led to our best product market fit in years. Global MAUs surpassed $500 million for the first time, reaching another record of $518 million, growing 12% and accelerating for the seventh consecutive quarter. Q1 revenue of $740 million grew 23%, nearly doubling our growth rate with an 11-point acceleration from just a quarter ago. To put these numbers into broader perspective, not only are we seeing acceleration since last quarter, in fact, we are driving the highest user and revenue growth on the platform since 2021. We also continue to drive significant improvements in profitability, resulting in Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $113 million or a 15% margin, up nearly 1,100 basis points from last year. As many of you will remember, we hosted our first Investor Day last fall, where we shared an in-depth view of our strategy, as well as our three to five-year targets for revenue and margins. We laid out multiple ways to drive revenue and how we would achieve our goals. First, growing users and deepening engagement per user. Second, continuing to increase ad load driven by the synergies between our users' strong commercial intent and relevant ads. Third, executing on our lower funnel revenue opportunity. And finally, driving demand through third-party partners, resellers, and international markets as additional levers to growth. Our results in Q1 are a testament to how each of these initiatives are performing as we expected or better. And all four of these drivers contributed to the revenue acceleration we saw in the first quarter and the strong outlook we have for the second quarter. In summary, we have multiple ways to win, and we are not overly reliant on any single initiative to achieve our objectives, which gives us confidence to deliver on these long-range targets. And we're driving strong momentum in our business, making it clear that we have shifted into a higher gear as we enter this next stage of growth. As we pass the $500 million MAU milestone, I'd like to take a step back and discuss some of the core initiatives over the past seven quarters that have driven much of the accelerating user growth and deepening engagement we're seeing today. We focused the company on what our users love most about Pinterest, with a particular emphasis on reinvigorating curation and satisfying commercial intent. We leaned heavily into next-gen AI and relevancy improvements. We updated our content strategy to focus on content that satisfies purpose and intent rather than pure entertainment. And we made clear that our shopping strategy was to partner with retailers rather than compete with them. We're now clearly moving at full speed, leaning into the reasons we know users come to Pinterest and making them even better. In doing so, we're finding our best product market fit in years. The drivers of user growth I'll discuss today are consistent with what I've laid out since joining Pinterest and that we elaborated on at our investor day. First, how we're using AI to drive relevance and personalization. Second, doubling down on curation through boards and collages. Third, driving actionability throughout our core surfaces. And lastly, creating a more positive alternative to traditional social media. The results of these efforts are seen in the accelerating growth rate of our monthly active users, the vast majority of whom come directly to our mobile app, deeply engagement per user with engagement growth in excess of user growth, and how we are winning with Gen Z, which is now our largest and fastest growing demographic at more than 40% of our users. It's important to note that our MAU growth acceleration is a result of months and quarters of compounding effects of these initiatives I just described, and we see much more opportunity ahead as we continue improving our core user experience and lean further into the unique and highly differentiated aspects of our platform. Let's start with our investments in AI to drive personalization and relevance. In the second half of 2022, we moved aggressively to implement LLMs and NextGen AI to improve our user experiences. We transitioned from CPU to GPU serving, which allowed us to serve models that were 100 times larger in size. This was the first step to unlocking a better product experience by improving our ability to surface more personalized content for our users. With GPU serving capabilities, we are developing and deploying even more complex models to drive further gains in relevancy and personalization. For example, our recommendation models were previously focused on serving content to drive greater view time in that immediate moment. However, as we've advanced our AI and sharpened our focus on user intent, we've incorporated more proprietary signals into our recommendation models to optimize for depths of engagement and satisfaction of intent, including driving more actual outcomes like saves, clicks, and conversions to help users progress further through their inspiration to action journey. Among these signals are the billions of acts of curation that happen on our platform in a manner that is highly distinct from the rest of social media. This gives us unique insight into user preferences, allowing us to tailor content to suit their needs and help them find their next use case. In summary, not only does our AI keep advancing, but there's also a flywheel effect that takes place. As we train our models on more user signals, we're driving even further relevance in our content recommendations, which then further improves the user signals our AI can act upon. As I mentioned, a key source of user signals is the human curation which takes place on our platform at scale, and we're improving this experience for our users. Our work on curation has been another driver of our user growth and is an integral step in the inspiration to action journey. To help remove the friction for users to begin creating boards, we've added additional board functionality, including auto-organization features. And for those who generally don't organize their saves, this feature resulted in annually 30% lift in boards created, highlighting how auto-organization can unlock the magic of Pinterest for more users. We're also significantly advancing what it means to curate on Pinterest with collages. Powered by our AI and advanced computer vision technology, collages are a powerful curation tool to cut out images and components from a pen and piece together new inspiring content. This greater granularity allows users to express their styles, tastes, and preferences in much more specific and creative ways. This is an entirely new, highly engaging, and highly shoppable content format. Users are roughly three times more likely to save collage pens versus other pens on Pinterest, in a significant portion contain clickable products. We're also continuing to see collages gain traction with Gen Z, who are nearly 70% of collage creators. Furthermore, improving the actionability of pens is another core tent of improving user satisfaction, deeply engagement, and growing MAUs. We know users come to Pinterest to shop, and we've been working to ensure our high-intent audience can find and easily take action on the content they see on Pinterest. We've integrated more shoppable content into our core surfaces, including home feed, search, and related items. For example, our guided shopping modules help users pick up where they left off on prior shopping journeys by resurfacing product pens based on past browsing and click history, while our visual shopping modules, such as Shop Similar and Shop the Look, allow users to shop the items they see within lifestyle images right when they discover them. In Q1, we brought shoppable video to Pinterest as we expanded Shop to Look to video pens. Now, when a user clicks on a video pen, a carousel will appear with shoppable pens that match items in the video. This allows the user to easily shop the items that bring them inspiration in the videos they were already watching. Through these and other efforts to improve the actionability of the platform, we've made it easier and more seamless to shop content on Pinterest, a top priority for our users. And we're seeing users take advantage of the improved actionability as outbound clicks to advertisers accelerated from last quarter, more than doubling year-over-year yet again. As a part of our efforts to grow users and deepen engagement, we're also building a more positive alternative to traditional social media. And we firmly believe that inspiration starts with inclusion. Building on past successes in inclusive product design, like skin tone and hair pattern search in 2023, we added to our suite of inclusive products with our body type ranges. We're also using the inclusive AI that powers these products to increase representation in the content that we show to users by default. And throughout 2023, we refined and implemented this technology across more surfaces so more people can see themselves reflected on Pinterest. Our users love and use these products. For example, the number of users searching with skin tone ranges doubled in the past year, which speaks to the affinity our users have for inclusive products and the work our team is doing to provide a more inspirational experience for everyone. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to win with Gen Z. They are more than 40% of the users on the platform and our largest and fastest growing demographic. Gen Z comes to our platform to get inspired and to shop. They save more than other demographics and also find value in new content formats like collages. And they see Pinterest as a distinct and separate destination from other social media apps. One where they can invest in themselves and refine their interests in smaller forums with closer connections and without the pressures and toxicity that often accompany their time on other social apps. In fact, Gen Z rates Pinterest higher on promoting and preserving well-being metrics like self-worth, belonging, and purpose compared to other traditional social media platforms. As a result, Pinterest is aging down, a rarity in consumer internet applications, which typically age up as they mature. We're also continuing to break through with Gen Z by connecting through culturally relevant moments. For example, we recently hosted an immersive activation at Coachella Music Festival, one of the biggest Gen Z moments of the year, to deepen their connection to Pinterest. Inspired by our festival trends report, we created the Pinterest manifestation, which invited festival goers to turn their favorite festival fashion and beauty dreams to reality with the help of expert makeup artists and stylists. Bringing this together, we've been moving fast and executing with tremendous clarity and focus over the past two years across the themes I've just discussed, which have all compounded to drive our acceleration and user growth. I'm proud of our team for all they've been able to accomplish thus far and look forward to continuing to innovate on behalf of our users. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable and performant for advertisers. We know that people come to Pinterest with intent. Our platform uniquely empowers users to have dynamic, multi-session journeys that take them from inspiration to action. For a long time, Pinterest excelled in upper funnel discovery in connection with the early stages of a user's inspiration to action journey. But Pinterest provided very little ability to take action on items that users found. Now, we're solving for that actionability in the lower funnel. Through seamless connections to retailers like mobile deep linking and direct links, enhanced ad platform capabilities like whole page optimization, and improved adoption of our foundational measurement capabilities like the API for conversions and clean rooms, we've made substantial improvements in executing on our lower funnel roadmap to deliver value for our users and our advertisers. We're seeing the direct impact of increased actionability play out. And the results we delivered this quarter prove this. We've accelerated clicks to advertisers again this quarter, even after more than doubling clicks year-on-year in Q4. And our revenue growth rate nearly doubled from Q4, driven by lower funnel revenue acceleration. Turning to some of the most notable achievements from the quarter, adoption of our lower funnel formats and tools has been a critical part of our monetization strategy. In Q1, we completed our rollout of direct links to our lower funnel ad formats, which now covers 97% of our lower funnel revenue, up from 80% last quarter. Direct links take users to an advertiser's product or purchase page in just one click, significantly reducing friction and improving the ability to take action. The value creation to advertisers has been outstanding, with clicks to advertisers more than doubling year-over-year. The underlying value direct links creates has been clear to us since it launched at the end of Q3, but for advertisers, it takes time to see and measure the results with their own source of truth, their measurement models. We're now seeing the value capture from direct links through increased ad spend, especially from some of the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. Similar to past new product launches like mobile deep links, advertisers who have seen sustained performance gains from direct links and are able to measure the results have started to increase their share of wallow with Pinterest. With some of our most sophisticated advertisers, we are reaching 5% or more of total ad budget, implying an even deeper penetration of their digital ad spend. However, much more of the value capture from direct links remains ahead of us. Many of our advertisers either recently got access to direct links or don't yet have the correct tools to understand their improved Pinterest performance, a process which can take months or quarters. As a result, we expect value capture from these advertisers to continue throughout the year as more of them begin to measure and react to the benefits from direct links. In order to facilitate advertiser adoption of our lower funnel solutions, which drive additional value capture, we've made a number of changes within our sales and go to market functions. For example, we're providing a scaled approach for our global sales force to educate on and implement lower funnel best practices with more technical support to help advertisers meet their specific goals and maximize performance. Turning to measurement, thanks to our improved lower funnel solutions, we're driving more clicks and conversions to advertisers. And through our measurement tools, we're proving this value to advertisers. Our suite of measurement tools starts with advertisers adopting our privacy-centric tools to preserve conversion visibility, which provides them with data to feed their individual models and measure their specific goals. One of our most important initiatives began in earnest in 2023 with our efforts to increase adoption of the API for conversions, which provides a server-to-server connection for advertisers to measure and attribute conversions. I'm pleased to report that we've grown the adoption of the API to nearly 40% of total revenue, up from 28% of total revenue at our investor day last September. As I've mentioned previously, revenue from retail advertisers who have adopted the API for conversions tends to grow significantly faster than revenue from those who have not yet adopted. This trend continued to hold in Q1 and underscores our desire to drive more privacy-centric measurement, particularly to lower funnel advertisers where it's most impactful. We're seeing a reinforcing effect take place. As advertisers adopt and see the benefits of shopping ads, mobile deep linking, or direct links, they are more incentivized to adopt our privacy-centric measurement. To that point, we also see that advertisers who have adopted our full lower funnel tool set, including shopping ads, mobile deep linking, or direct links, and our API for conversions are also growing much faster than those who have no lower funnel solution adoption. As we look ahead to more industry changes, which will affect an advertiser's ability to measure conversions, we are strongly promoting API for conversions adoption to our lower funnel advertisers and our selling efforts, and increasing the amount of variable compensation attached to adoption. We are also focused on meeting advertisers where they are by integrating into their measurement tools of choice, such as clean rooms and over 20 measurement platform integrations. In addition to format and measurement innovations, we remain committed to bringing AI-based automation to the forefront of our campaign creation experience and ads offering to drive performance for our advertisers. In fact, 2023 was a strong year for ads innovation as we accelerated our product delivery and launched more ad formats, tools, and solutions than in any year in our history. We've seen a lot of success with our current automation tools and we're investing to build out this suite in order to give advertisers an array of tools to build, optimize, manage, and measure campaigns on Pinterest. Today, our automated suite of performance features includes tools such as automated bidding, expanded targeting, and flexible daily budgets. Each of these automation offerings helps to drive more efficient campaigns on Pinterest. As of Q1, we continue to see revenue coverage above 80% for automated bidding, while over half of our revenue utilizes either expanded targeting or flexible daily budgets. However, there's still significant room for us to go and driving further revenue coverage of our entire automation suite, which, when adopted, results in compounding positive impacts on campaign performance. To drive further uptake, we plan to launch a campaign creation tool to simplify setup for our automated offerings and removes friction for advertisers to leverage these tools. We're also building out additional automation components to drive greater campaign efficiency for advertisers. We will release these features in stages and as with other new launches they will go through a typical product ramp as we develop, test, and scale ultimately creating a more robust suite of automation tools to improve advertiser performance. Let me touch on a couple of the new offerings we're expecting to roll out over the coming quarters. First, we're launching our dynamic creative optimization solution set which will allow advertisers to use generative AI to optimize the creative for their ads. Overtime we'll personalize this technology using signals that are unique to Pinterest. Such that the imagery users see will be tailored to their own interests and aesthetics. We'll also be introducing row ad bidding. This solution will seek to increase advertiser return on ad spend by automatically optimizing campaigns in real time to prioritize users or products that drive the highest ROI. This rollout is a continuation of automation features we've already been delivering so that ultimately advertisers will be able to provide us with a budget, a goal, and their seed creative and we'll do the rest. We'll manage bidding, targeting, and dynamic creative at scale all in service of delivering the best possible performance for our advertisers. Next, I want to provide an update on our third party demand efforts. Consistent with our commentary from the start, our goal in developing these partnerships is to complement our first party demand and round out demand gaps in our auction. We are currently scaling third party demand with two partners, Amazon Ads in the U.S. and Google Ads Manager, which recently went live in February in unmonetized international markets. Our Amazon partnership is live on all of our main surfaces in the U.S. and we are continuing to optimize our respective systems to improve relevance and drive performance for advertisers. Additionally, our Google partnership, while early, is also progressing nicely. In Q1, as expected, we saw an emerging contribution to revenue from third party demand and we anticipate this will be the base from which further third party revenue will grow throughout the year. We continue to see opportunities to expand our current partnerships to multiple geographies and for multiple partners to exist within the same market. Consistent with what we laid out at our investor day, we also have an opportunity to grow our revenue in international markets and are employing a multi-prong strategy to do so. In our largest international markets, we are using first party selling efforts to strategically capture advertiser demand. We're also deepening our partnership with agencies to grow within these markets. In smaller markets, where we previously had not monetized or are under monetized, we are introducing additional sources of demand to fill in gaps in our auction. In addition to third party demand from Google, this quarter we will begin working with resellers to bring in local ad demand, primarily in rest of world markets. Resellers provide a scaled approach to drive demand in markets where we don't currently have a sales presence and can bring relevant ad content for users in those markets. Like any new selling effort, demand from resellers will take time to grow in these markets and therefore we expect this initiative to ramp over the course of the year. Our third strategic priority has been a continued focus on operational rigor and discipline. As I mentioned before, I'm extremely proud of our team's continued strong execution, as evidenced by our ability to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 1,100 basis points in Q1, while also accelerating product innovation and product market fit. Now I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks Bill and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll be discussing our first quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary second quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Our team has made tremendous progress across users, monetization, and profitability over the past few quarters. This quarter is a testament to how focused execution and alignment across our strategic priorities can drive strong gains for the business. Like Bill said, we found our best product market fit in years. Users and advertisers alike are taking notice, leading to our highest MAU count ever in our fastest revenue growth quarter since 2021. User growth is accelerating as we are investing in areas that are unique to Pinterest, such as human curation at scale that allows our AI to generate highly relevant personalization and recommendations across multi-session commercial journeys and significant improvements in actionability. We also see our investments in positivity and inclusion resonating deeply with our users. Additionally, our lower funnel tools and formats including mobile deep linking, API for conversions and clean rooms, as well as direct links are driving meaningful and sustained ROI improvement for advertisers, which are reflected in our continuing revenue acceleration. These efforts have been complemented by our introduction of third-party demand onto the platform, which has added density to our auction and allowed us to serve more relevant and engaging ads to our users. Now let's dive into our first quarter results. We ended the quarter with 518 million global monthly active users, growing 12% and reaching another record high. We accelerated user growth year-over-year across all our geographic regions. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 98 million MAUs, growing 3%, up from 2% last quarter, adding 1 million sequential users for the third quarter in a row. In Europe, we had 140 million MAUs, growing 10%, up from 8% last quarter. In our rest of world markets, we had 279 million MAUs, growing 16%, up from 15% last quarter. Now to revenue. In Q1, our global revenue was $740 million, up 23% or 22% on a constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel. Our lowest funnel conversion objective was our fastest growing, with particular strength coming from our shopping ads format as advertisers turned to Pinterest to drive sales. We know that we are creating value for our advertisers, and we're seeing signs of value capture from our largest, most sophisticated advertisers that have been able to see sustained performance gains in their own measurement sources of truth and shifted more budget to us as a result. However, we finished our GA rollout of direct links in March, and we expect more value capture to still be in front of us, similar to the historical lag we've seen between value creation and value capture from other lower funnel products we've launched, such as mobile deep linking, API for conversions, and our shopping ads format. From a vertical perspective, we saw broad strength in retail. Within retail, we saw our larger, more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform as they have adopted our lower funnel tools and are seeing continued success. We also saw a nice growth in our emerging categories, including financial services and technology. Next, as expected, our third-party demand partnerships began to scale in Q1 and were an emerging contributor to our growth. Finally, we estimate that leap day in February and the Easter shift into March this year contributed approximately two points of growth to Q1. Turning to our geographical breakouts, in the U.S. and Canada, we generated $592 million in revenue, growing 22%. Strength came from retailers and emerging categories, including technology and financial services. In Europe, revenue was $118 million, growing 27% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. Strength in Europe came from retail and CPG categories. Revenue from the rest of the world was $30 million, growing 25% on a reported basis or 26% on a constant currency basis. In Q1, ad impressions, which is composed of ad load and total impressions, including both organic and paid impressions, grew 38%. This was driven both by increases in total impressions as well as increases in ad load. We've been able to flex up our ad load through whole-page optimization to provide relevant ads to users in moments of high commercial intent, and we see continued room to steadily progress this as we further improve the actionability of our users' commercial journeys and relevance of ads. Meanwhile, ad pricing declined 11%, an improvement from down 16% last quarter, largely as a result of accelerating ad demand. But still, a year-over-year decline as we continue to drive increased value to advertisers in the form of more clicks and greater efficiency. Moving to expenses. For the past few quarters, we've been able to drive continued margin expansion through effective expense discipline while allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. Cost of revenue in Q1 was $177 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q4. Due to increased infrastructure spend related to users and engagement growth, partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $453 million, up 10%. The increase was primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses across R&D and sales and marketing, as well as incremental marketing spend. Our revenue outperformance and expense discipline led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, coming in at $113 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. This was up approximately 1,100 basis points versus last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.8 billion. We utilized approximately $100 million of cash in the quarter on net share settlement of equity awards. As a reminder, this process mitigates dilution by holding back shares to cover the taxes on employees' vested RSUs, where the company pays for the taxes from our own cash reserve on behalf of the employees. This process, combined with last year's share repurchase, has led to an approximately 1.6% decline in year-over-year fully diluted share count relative to the positive 2% to 3% average annual dilution target that we outlined at our investor day. Now we'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 2024 revenue to be in the range of $835 million to $850 million, representing 18% to 20% growth year-over-year. This guidance represents a continuation of the strong growth we saw in Q1, driven by many of the same initiatives I just outlined, including direct links value capture and the emerging contribution from third-party demand partnerships. This guidance range is roughly consistent with the revenue growth that we've seen in Q1, when adjusting for the two points of year-over-year growth benefit in Q1 from the Easter timing shift and leap day, and an additional one-point benefit in Q1 from foreign exchange, which we're not expecting to continue into Q2 based on current spot rates. Turning to our expense guidance, we expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $490 million to $505 million, growing 11% to 15% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to continue our infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore we anticipate non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q1. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we are investing in headcount for AI talent across our business. As we have said previously, we are anticipating year-over-year margin expansion again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023, as we balance investing in growth and flowing profitability through to the bottom line. We expect margin expansion in both halves of 2024. However, we expect significantly more margin expansion to occur in the first half versus a more modest level in the second half, as we lap the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. All-in-all, I'm pleased with the strong progress we've made against our strategic priorities. There's strong momentum in our business, and we're successfully executing against our plan. Now I hand it over to Bill for some final words.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Julia. I want to thank our team at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian, your line is open if you'd like to proceed with your question.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the first quarter results seem to come in quite a bit stronger than the guide. So I was just curious about any specific areas you'd call out that really came in a lot better than you were expecting, call it 90 days ago. And then the second one is we sort of look at the back half of the year. Julia, I know the year-on-year growth comps get a little more difficult. How do we think about sort of continuing to be able to grow at this 20% clip even through the more challenging comps because of all the momentum you have with the business and third party partners, etcetera? Thanks.\nWilliam Ready: Thanks, Brian. On your first question, we were really pleased with the revenue acceleration we saw this quarter leading us to come in above the high end of our guidance range. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and that we talked about it yesterday as well, we've got multiple ways to win and drive revenue. And we're seeing broad-based strength across all of these initiatives, all of which are performing generally as we expected or better. First of all, continued strong amount of engagement growth on the platform. We're seeing the best product market fit we've seen in years, not only growing MAU, but deepening engagement even as we accelerate the rate of user ads on the platform. And we're doing that synergistically with ad load. We are demonstrating that because our users have commercial intent, ads can be relevant content on the platform. Second, on monetization, strength in the lower funnel driven by our shopping ads and direct links value capture, a strong contributor. There's particular strength in U.S. and retail where we're taking share and starting to get more access into performance budgets. And that's really driven by the fact that we, again, doubled the number of clicks to advertiser\u2019s year-on-year. We doubled the number of clicks to advertisers in Q4, and more than doubled the number of clicks to advertisers again in Q1, and actually accelerated from Q4. So that's really driving that penetration into those performance budgets and driving strength in U.S. and retail. And as I mentioned, we saw an emerging contribution in Q1 from our 3P partnerships, which are ramping, and which helped to complement the really strong growth that we're seeing in first party demand. So it really is broad based. All of those contributed to the acceleration in Q1, and we see that continuing as we think about the Q2 revenue guidance as well. And with that, I'll give it over to Julia for your second question.\nJulia Donnelly: Yes, so thanks, Brian. So I think it's clear we're shifting into a higher gear here in the first half of 2024, and Bill just outlined a number of those drivers. We're clearly seeing a more favorable ad market backdrop, but perhaps more importantly, we're also seeing the initiatives that we laid out playing out kind of as we expected or even better, as Bill just outlined. We do have tougher comps going into the back half of the year and there are some additional uncertainties from the ramping deprecation of third party cookies on Chrome through this year and into early 2025. But as we've said before, on cookies from a relevancy and targeting perspective, we feel like we are well positioned, given our unique first party signal. And from a measurement adoption perspective, we feel like we're doing all the things we need to do to drive privacy safe adoption among our advertiser base. However, we expect many of the initiatives that Bill just outlined to ramp throughout this year as well. Specifically, we think more of the value capture on direct links is ahead of us and behind us, and we expect third party ad demand to continue contributing to growth and grow off the base that we are seeing here in Q1. So those are the puts and takes as we think about 2024 revenue from here, but we feel really good about the initiatives that we're driving.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thank you both.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric, your line is open, please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I'm going to be following on what Brian asked there, just looking out towards the second half and even over a multi-year timeframe. How do you think about the key investments that have to be made in the platform over the medium to long-term? And how should we be thinking about your relative competitive positioning on those products relative to other scale players in the industry that are employing equal amounts of sort of OpEx and CapEx as percentage of revenue towards initiatives like shopability and AI? So a bit of a relative competition question as well as investment scale as we go through this year. Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yes, thanks, Eric. Well, what I'd say is, if you look over the past seven quarters, I think we have demonstrably improved our competitive positioning across the board. You look at our growth rate in users, the fact that users grew across every geography, we continue to deepen engagement per user, and that really speaks to just how much the greater actionability that we're driving for our users, both on shopping and on curation, is causing deeper user engagement in the platform that's really been driven by both AI advancements and the unique signal on our platform where people curate on our platform. So we just get truly unique signal that doesn't exist anyplace else where users spend hours and hours and hours refining their interest, curating their interest, and we understand their interest at a depth that you just couldn't understand otherwise. As the AI acts upon that, it lets us drive much more relevant recommendations. And so, yes, you have general competition and large models, but we also have completely unique signal that we're able to train those models on that unique signal and you see that evidence in the relevancy improvements we made. Same on the ad side. For advertisers, we're able to bring them users in a highly commercial moment where they have intent but have not yet decided what to buy. So it's greater commercial intent than you would see elsewhere in social, but it's also bringing more of the inspiration than what you would typically find on other very low funnel moments. So I think that's demonstrating that we have a unique space to be occupied with the user where they see us as something distinct and separate from the rest of social media, where social media tends to be lean back entertainment, we have lean forward commercial intent. We are still early in our journey and what we can get from that, we see a multi-year journey ahead as to how we continue to refine and make that better. And then that cuts through to advertisers where we're delivering very strong performance to advertisers. Doubling the number of clicks year-on-year is exceptional. Our advertisers see that as exceptional, and as Julia noted, more of the value capture from that still lies ahead of us versus behind us, and we think there's more runway to go in driving more and more commerciality on our platforms. We feel really well positioned in a unique space, and as AI continues to advance, we're able to adopt off-the-shelf large language models, tune those to our unique signals, and then get very unique results because of the very distinct, unique signals we get on our platform because of the human curation at scale on our platform.\nJulia Donnelly: And then, Eric, maybe to the second part of your question on sort of investment areas in 2024. So, as a reminder, overall in 2024, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA margin expansion overall, but on a dollar basis in terms of the areas where we're looking to ramp, operating expenses in particular, there we're really focused on R&D investments, so headcount additions primarily in the AI space, as Bill was mentioning, to benefit both our users and our advertisers, as well as on the sales and marketing line where we anticipate adding to our sales organization with a focus on enhanced technical selling capabilities, particularly in the lower funnel and some expansion of frontline sellers as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from the line of Ron Josey of Citigroup. Ron, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit more as a follow-up to some questions around your comments around greater returns for advertisers and gaining access to performance budgets. And one of the questions we get is just the visibility that Pinterest has on these budgets and adoption of these newer tools. And so, great to hear progress in direct links and API for conversions, but we'd just love to hear a little bit more on your commentary around direct links adoption. I think you talked about measurement tools, more advertisers need to be walked through the process. So, any insights there would be helpful. And then you mentioned the launch of dynamic, I think, campaign creation tools and then the 2D launch of real-ad bidding. Just talk to us how you envision all these tools sort of coming together as we move forward here. Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yes, certainly. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we launched direct links at the very tail end of Q3. So really, Q4 is when we first started to see its effect. We continue to ramp that through Q1. We now have 97% of our lower funnel revenue has adopted the direct links format. And our conversion for our API for conversion is now covering 40% of revenue. So, the effect that, both Julie and I have talked about is that there's a lag effect between the value that we create for advertisers when we start to send them more clicks and send them better conversions and better return, and when they're able to see that flow through to their models and measurement systems, which typically has sometimes a quarter or multi-quarter lag effect, particularly if they haven't implemented measurement. So, when we say that we see more of the value capture still in front of us than behind us, we clearly see that value capture happening with direct links. We've seen budgets shift. As I mentioned, in my remarks that we're seeing, particularly with some of the larger, more sophisticated advertisers that pick up these changes very quickly, we're seeing that they have shifted budgets and that we are now, capturing 5% or more of total budget, which imply a much deeper penetration of their digital budget and going into their performance budgets, whereas historically, Pinterest would have been oftentimes in sort of experimental or social budgets. We're now shifting more into those always-on performance budgets and doing quite well there. But, that broad-based adoption of the measurement tools that let the advertisers see it and then their shift of budget, we see more of that in front of us than behind us, but that's what gives us confidence, our ability to continue delivering because we know that we're delivering the clicks to those advertisers. And then the second part of your question around the automation suite for those advertisers, we have delivered some of the most important components of a full automation suite, like the fact that we have 80% plus our revenue going through automated bidding. But we have some other really meaningful components that are still in front of us, like dynamic creative optimization, which we\u2019ll be launching and ramping over the coming quarters, and ROAS-level bidding, which is also going to be launching and ramping over the coming quarters. So these are things that say, okay, we know there's a compounding effect of delivering more clicks and conversions to the advertisers, giving them more ability to measure it, and then making it easier and easier for them to create sort of set it and forget it campaigns that deliver them great ROI. All those things have a compounding effect. And with each one of those, we've got clear elements of the potential of that, but then we're driving more and more of that adoption, which is what gives us confidence in the continued adoption ahead. And, finally, I just mentioned, I talked about some in my remarks, everything that we've talked about here is consistent with what I've said since I joined, what we outlined at our investor day. These things have compounding benefits over time. So don't expect like big bang moments on these things. But you saw us hit a new gear from H1 to H2 last year. We doubled our growth rate from H1 to H2 last year. You're seeing us do it again as we come into this quarter and project forward into next quarter in the Q2. And so those are compounding benefits. And so expect that similar kind of behavior that the benefits just continue to compound versus, one big hockey stick moment in a particular quarter. Hopefully that helps.\nRon Josey: That's great. Thank you, Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Bill, I guess another big picture question. I think last year coming into earlier this year, there was a debate in both the advertiser industry and among the investment community around how smaller platforms like Pinterest and Snap and others are able to keep pace or not with the larger platforms given levels of investment. I would say these 1Q results fly in the face of that or at least answer some of that debate. So I guess the question is, how are the conversations with marketers changing? You obviously sound pretty good about the sustainability of the growth that you're seeing. But I guess, what gives you that confidence? And as you look out over the next year or two with things like, the TikTok situation going on, how do you see those conversations with marketers changing, in your favor going forward? Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yes. Thanks, Ross. Yes. We feel great about our competitive positioning. We think we have a unique and distinct use case for our users. And we have strong commercial intent and we're now delivering more and more of that performance for advertisers. And we see those advertisers shifting budget to us and notably, moving us into those performance budgets, those always on budgets versus the experimental area that Pinterest historically played in. And I'd say what's fueling that, again, is the uniqueness of the use case we solve for our users. But also as you think about the way that AI plays out, I do think this first wave of AI or some of the first conversations in AI were about, value accruing to the model creators and those who have like the largest general purpose models. I think it's also the case that there's a distinct set of value creation around both fit for purpose models and taking unique signal, applying it to those larger models. And you see us doing both. We have taken off the shelf larger models. We then train them on our unique user signal that lets us, you know, I talked about on prior quarters called 10 full percentage points improvement and user relevancy. So you see us doing those kinds of things. You also see us doing things with our own foundational models like really unique computer vision work where we have one of the largest image corpuses [ph] out there. We have really unique signal about how users associate those images, styling outfits and styling rooms and things like that. And that's let us train fit for purpose models. So we feel really good about our ability to compete both in terms of a unique space for the user, delivering great value for advertisers, leading them to shift share to us. And we think there's more of that to go as they're just now starting to measure and see that and shift budgets. And from an AI perspective, we feel really well positioned in terms of the uniqueness of the signal we get through the human curation on our platform. As we're leaning into that, we're seeing that accelerate as well through things like our collage format, which is driving three times the engagement, approximately three times the engagement of traditional pens. So we think that's an entirely new content type on Pinterest that is unique to what people do on Pinterest, fueled by AI and has this flywheel effect of feeding us more and more granular signals that let us train our AI to do unique things that don't occur on other platforms. So all that to say, yes, we feel good. It's a competitive space. It always will be. But we feel well positioned and I think reflected in our results\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from the line of Anthony Post [ph] of Bank of America of Merrill Lynch. Anthony your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. So we thought U.S. really accelerate this quarter and some of the international markets were strong, but decelerated. Can you talk about how much the drivers in the U.S. or kind of maybe unique to the U.S. and then if Amazon was above your expectations in the quarter. And then finally maybe as you think about some of these drivers whether it's partnership or your own internal efforts, what -- is there more to come internationally in the back half or next year? Thank you\nWilliam Ready: Yes on international, I'd say again more the opportunities in front of us than behind us. I talked about the Google 3P partnership is just getting going. So that wasn't really a contributor in this quarter. We see more of that as we look ahead. I'd say stepping back more broadly the shopping improvements that we have made, the lower funnel improvements we have made. Of course, we started with our home market our largest market first, and we're now taking more of those things international, and you can see [Technical Difficulty] Yes, I think about now back on so great. Thank you apologies for the technical glitch there So we see that those shopping improvements that we've made starting in the U.S. that now as we're just starting to take them international that that's resonating with users as well. So when you look at our MAU acceleration we saw accelerated user growth in every geography that speaks to how broad based the product improvements are from a user perspective And then now we're taking those advertiser tools and those markets [Indiscernible] shopability in the low funnel, both from a 1P perspective as well as just starting with our 3P and reseller efforts I talked about as well. So we see much more that opportunity international still in front of us.\nJulia Donnelly: And maybe just to add to that Justin. So on the U.S. side as Bill was noting, we\u2019re seeing really strong growth in our first party business particularly in retail, but also emerging contribution from third-party ad demand as you mentioned. And then maybe just to follow up on the international side as well. We do see currency headwind in Q1 that if you look on a constant currency basis Europe and rest of world growth was actually the same on a constant currency basis or stronger in Q1 relative to Q4. So I would take a keen eye towards the FX changes here which are changing in Q4, Q1 and also in Q2 as we call that when we talked about guidance for the second quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from the line of Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Doug your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Just when you think about the progress in shopability and moving down the funnel, can you just talk about how that's translating into growth in advertiser count and the degree to which you're seeing a pickup in auction density. And then any early learnings from the third-party deals with Amazon and Google anything that surprised you thus far? Thanks.\nWilliam Ready: Great. Yes. Well, I would say, our growth and strength has been most pronounced in lower funnel particularly in U.S. retail and amongst the largest most sophisticated advertisers, but we do see that starting to broaden out as sort of other retailers adopt the ability to do privacy safe measurement. As I will see that flow through the models, we see that starting to flow through to a broader set of retailers as well. So we have, our business is less SMB centric, but we do see that our improvements in shopability are benefiting a broad swath of retailers from the largest all the way through to smaller retailers as well. So we think more the value capture today is occurring with the largest most sophisticated. There is faster to react but when we say there's like a multi-core adoption curve on these things that will start to take us deeper and deeper into sort of midsize and smaller retailers as well. So hope that helps give you a little bit of color on that part of it.\nDoug Anmuth: And then on 3P fields this\u2026\nWilliam Ready: Yes on the third party side of it, 3P is doing exactly what we expected it to do. And if you step back, when we introduced 3P about a year ago, we were excited to announce our first third-party partnership with Amazon ads then. And when we first introduced 3P, we talked about the opportunity for 3P to work in parallel with 1P to round out gaps in our auction, leading to greater relevancy and shopability for our users. And ultimately, improved monetization. And of course, we've also been investing heavily in our 1P business, even as we introduced the 3P opportunity. And we talked about how we believe that creating numerous ways to win, driving a balanced, durable top-line growth, where this would be a compliment for auction, that that was the approach we were taking. And so, when we've talked about 3P efforts as a compliment, it's not that we believe that we're any less excited to see the long-term potential any less. It's just we're also seeing significant accelerating strength in our 1P business. So our 1P is rounding out those gaps in our auction, bringing much more auction density. And then 3P is contributing nicely to that as a compliment as well. So again, we see that playing out, as we had expected in terms of complimenting our 1P demand, bringing more density to the auction, creating greater shopability. It is broad-based because we see broad-based strength in retail, both 1st-party and 3P as an emerging contributor to that. And as I mentioned in my comments, we expect that where we are now on 3P is a base from which we'll continue to grow as we optimize further and further with our partners and look forward to how we'll bring in more demand to compliment our auction. Hope that helps.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you, Bill.\nWilliam Ready: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today will be from the line of Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Hey, thanks. Two questions, please. You talked about, Bill, about adding potentially more partners beyond Amazon and Google. If you just put some expectations, set some expectations around there. It's kind of hard to see any partners that could be as material as those. But maybe I'm not being creative enough and thinking about it. And then secondly, Julia, I know you quantify the impact in the March quarter from Leap Day and Easter Timing. Is it safe to assume that the emerging contribution from 3P would have been less than that? And that's why you didn't quantify it. Thank you.\nWilliam Ready: Yes, thanks, Mark. So again, we're just getting going with our 3P efforts. Again, we feel that those are performing in line with our expectations from what we've talked about previously. We're just starting on the international side. Google's certainly a great first partner there, but we're just getting going. And as we carry forward, we think about, we're always looking at this as sort of a retail problem. You have the right products on the shelves when the user walks in. And so we're always looking at where do we need more density? Where do we need more shoppable inventory to round out what the user is looking for? And we'll continue to look at what are the best partners to round that out. As you noted, we've brought in some really great partners already. We see really phenomenal momentum in our first-party business, which is always what you would hope to see first and foremost. But we'll continue to look at how we round out those get-ups. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities to expand our current partnerships to multiple geographies versus the geographies that are in today. And we're continuously evaluating additional partners that can complement the auction going forward. So obviously, I'm not going to comment on any new partner before we have a new partner signed up. We're continuously evaluating those. And even though it's been a nice, 3P has been a nice emerging contributor, we're just getting going internationally. And we see a lot more opportunity to continue on that effort. And then I'll give to Julia for your second question.\nJulia Donnelly: So Mark on the second part of your question. So we've always said we're not going to specifically break out 3P versus 1P for many reasons, one is that they go together in the same auction, and -- compliment one another as we said. And so the reason I didn\u2019t call it out not because of what you said or I would not make that assumption. The reason I didn\u2019t call it out as I was trying to call in Q1 sort of specific unique seasonal factors that benefitted Q1 that would not continue into Q2. In comparison 3P is something that is benefitting Q1 and continuing to benefit Q2 and something that we see scaling and ramping throughout the year. So I would not draw any other conclusions.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you Julia, thank you Bill.\nJulia Donnelly: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Unfortunately, we have no further time for any further questions at this time. So I\u2019d like to hand back to Bill Ready for any closing remarks.\nWilliam Ready: Alright, thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. As always we look forward to keeping this dialogue going. And we hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Julia Donnelly",
            "content": "Thanks Bill and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll be discussing our first quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on our preliminary second quarter 2024 outlook. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Our team has made tremendous progress across users, monetization, and profitability over the past few quarters. This quarter is a testament to how focused execution and alignment across our strategic priorities can drive strong gains for the business. Like Bill said, we found our best product market fit in years. Users and advertisers alike are taking notice, leading to our highest MAU count ever in our fastest revenue growth quarter since 2021. User growth is accelerating as we are investing in areas that are unique to Pinterest, such as human curation at scale that allows our AI to generate highly relevant personalization and recommendations across multi-session commercial journeys and significant improvements in actionability. We also see our investments in positivity and inclusion resonating deeply with our users. Additionally, our lower funnel tools and formats including mobile deep linking, API for conversions and clean rooms, as well as direct links are driving meaningful and sustained ROI improvement for advertisers, which are reflected in our continuing revenue acceleration. These efforts have been complemented by our introduction of third-party demand onto the platform, which has added density to our auction and allowed us to serve more relevant and engaging ads to our users. Now let's dive into our first quarter results. We ended the quarter with 518 million global monthly active users, growing 12% and reaching another record high. We accelerated user growth year-over-year across all our geographic regions. In the U.S. and Canada, we had 98 million MAUs, growing 3%, up from 2% last quarter, adding 1 million sequential users for the third quarter in a row. In Europe, we had 140 million MAUs, growing 10%, up from 8% last quarter. In our rest of world markets, we had 279 million MAUs, growing 16%, up from 15% last quarter. Now to revenue. In Q1, our global revenue was $740 million, up 23% or 22% on a constant currency basis. The revenue strength this quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, highlights how we are driving value for advertisers across the full funnel. Our lowest funnel conversion objective was our fastest growing, with particular strength coming from our shopping ads format as advertisers turned to Pinterest to drive sales. We know that we are creating value for our advertisers, and we're seeing signs of value capture from our largest, most sophisticated advertisers that have been able to see sustained performance gains in their own measurement sources of truth and shifted more budget to us as a result. However, we finished our GA rollout of direct links in March, and we expect more value capture to still be in front of us, similar to the historical lag we've seen between value creation and value capture from other lower funnel products we've launched, such as mobile deep linking, API for conversions, and our shopping ads format. From a vertical perspective, we saw broad strength in retail. Within retail, we saw our larger, more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform as they have adopted our lower funnel tools and are seeing continued success. We also saw a nice growth in our emerging categories, including financial services and technology. Next, as expected, our third-party demand partnerships began to scale in Q1 and were an emerging contributor to our growth. Finally, we estimate that leap day in February and the Easter shift into March this year contributed approximately two points of growth to Q1. Turning to our geographical breakouts, in the U.S. and Canada, we generated $592 million in revenue, growing 22%. Strength came from retailers and emerging categories, including technology and financial services. In Europe, revenue was $118 million, growing 27% on a reported basis or 25% on a constant currency basis. Strength in Europe came from retail and CPG categories. Revenue from the rest of the world was $30 million, growing 25% on a reported basis or 26% on a constant currency basis. In Q1, ad impressions, which is composed of ad load and total impressions, including both organic and paid impressions, grew 38%. This was driven both by increases in total impressions as well as increases in ad load. We've been able to flex up our ad load through whole-page optimization to provide relevant ads to users in moments of high commercial intent, and we see continued room to steadily progress this as we further improve the actionability of our users' commercial journeys and relevance of ads. Meanwhile, ad pricing declined 11%, an improvement from down 16% last quarter, largely as a result of accelerating ad demand. But still, a year-over-year decline as we continue to drive increased value to advertisers in the form of more clicks and greater efficiency. Moving to expenses. For the past few quarters, we've been able to drive continued margin expansion through effective expense discipline while allocating resources towards our highest ROI initiatives. Cost of revenue in Q1 was $177 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q4. Due to increased infrastructure spend related to users and engagement growth, partially offset by our continued work to drive cost optimizations on our infrastructure spend. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $453 million, up 10%. The increase was primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses across R&D and sales and marketing, as well as incremental marketing spend. Our revenue outperformance and expense discipline led to another strong quarter of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, coming in at $113 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. This was up approximately 1,100 basis points versus last year. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.8 billion. We utilized approximately $100 million of cash in the quarter on net share settlement of equity awards. As a reminder, this process mitigates dilution by holding back shares to cover the taxes on employees' vested RSUs, where the company pays for the taxes from our own cash reserve on behalf of the employees. This process, combined with last year's share repurchase, has led to an approximately 1.6% decline in year-over-year fully diluted share count relative to the positive 2% to 3% average annual dilution target that we outlined at our investor day. Now we'll discuss our preliminary guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 2024 revenue to be in the range of $835 million to $850 million, representing 18% to 20% growth year-over-year. This guidance represents a continuation of the strong growth we saw in Q1, driven by many of the same initiatives I just outlined, including direct links value capture and the emerging contribution from third-party demand partnerships. This guidance range is roughly consistent with the revenue growth that we've seen in Q1, when adjusting for the two points of year-over-year growth benefit in Q1 from the Easter timing shift and leap day, and an additional one-point benefit in Q1 from foreign exchange, which we're not expecting to continue into Q2 based on current spot rates. Turning to our expense guidance, we expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $490 million to $505 million, growing 11% to 15% year-over-year. Our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. However, we plan to continue our infrastructure optimization efforts, and therefore we anticipate non-GAAP cost of revenue expense to be relatively consistent with Q1. The increase in non-GAAP operating expense year-over-year is driven by investment increases in R&D, where we are investing in headcount for AI talent across our business. As we have said previously, we are anticipating year-over-year margin expansion again in 2024, but at a more modest level than the 660 basis point expansion we delivered in 2023, as we balance investing in growth and flowing profitability through to the bottom line. We expect margin expansion in both halves of 2024. However, we expect significantly more margin expansion to occur in the first half versus a more modest level in the second half, as we lap the strengthening adjusted EBITDA margins we drove in the second half of 2023. All-in-all, I'm pleased with the strong progress we've made against our strategic priorities. There's strong momentum in our business, and we're successfully executing against our plan. Now I hand it over to Bill for some final words. Yes, so thanks, Brian. So I think it's clear we're shifting into a higher gear here in the first half of 2024, and Bill just outlined a number of those drivers. We're clearly seeing a more favorable ad market backdrop, but perhaps more importantly, we're also seeing the initiatives that we laid out playing out kind of as we expected or even better, as Bill just outlined. We do have tougher comps going into the back half of the year and there are some additional uncertainties from the ramping deprecation of third party cookies on Chrome through this year and into early 2025. But as we've said before, on cookies from a relevancy and targeting perspective, we feel like we are well positioned, given our unique first party signal. And from a measurement adoption perspective, we feel like we're doing all the things we need to do to drive privacy safe adoption among our advertiser base. However, we expect many of the initiatives that Bill just outlined to ramp throughout this year as well. Specifically, we think more of the value capture on direct links is ahead of us and behind us, and we expect third party ad demand to continue contributing to growth and grow off the base that we are seeing here in Q1. So those are the puts and takes as we think about 2024 revenue from here, but we feel really good about the initiatives that we're driving. And then, Eric, maybe to the second part of your question on sort of investment areas in 2024. So, as a reminder, overall in 2024, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA margin expansion overall, but on a dollar basis in terms of the areas where we're looking to ramp, operating expenses in particular, there we're really focused on R&D investments, so headcount additions primarily in the AI space, as Bill was mentioning, to benefit both our users and our advertisers, as well as on the sales and marketing line where we anticipate adding to our sales organization with a focus on enhanced technical selling capabilities, particularly in the lower funnel and some expansion of frontline sellers as well. And maybe just to add to that Justin. So on the U.S. side as Bill was noting, we're seeing really strong growth in our first party business particularly in retail, but also emerging contribution from third-party ad demand as you mentioned. And then maybe just to follow up on the international side as well. We do see currency headwind in Q1 that if you look on a constant currency basis Europe and rest of world growth was actually the same on a constant currency basis or stronger in Q1 relative to Q4. So I would take a keen eye towards the FX changes here which are changing in Q4, Q1 and also in Q2 as we call that when we talked about guidance for the second quarter. So Mark on the second part of your question. So we've always said we're not going to specifically break out 3P versus 1P for many reasons, one is that they go together in the same auction, and -- compliment one another as we said. And so the reason I didn't call it out not because of what you said or I would not make that assumption. The reason I didn't call it out as I was trying to call in Q1 sort of specific unique seasonal factors that benefitted Q1 that would not continue into Q2. In comparison 3P is something that is benefitting Q1 and continuing to benefit Q2 and something that we see scaling and ramping throughout the year. So I would not draw any other conclusions. Thanks, Mark."

            "name": "William Ready",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. In Q1, we accelerated our progress against our strategic priorities, growing users and engagement, creating value for our advertisers through our lower funnel solutions, and continuing to deliver profitable growth through operational efficiency. Investing in our core differentiators has led to our best product market fit in years. Global MAUs surpassed $500 million for the first time, reaching another record of $518 million, growing 12% and accelerating for the seventh consecutive quarter. Q1 revenue of $740 million grew 23%, nearly doubling our growth rate with an 11-point acceleration from just a quarter ago. To put these numbers into broader perspective, not only are we seeing acceleration since last quarter, in fact, we are driving the highest user and revenue growth on the platform since 2021. We also continue to drive significant improvements in profitability, resulting in Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $113 million or a 15% margin, up nearly 1,100 basis points from last year. As many of you will remember, we hosted our first Investor Day last fall, where we shared an in-depth view of our strategy, as well as our three to five-year targets for revenue and margins. We laid out multiple ways to drive revenue and how we would achieve our goals. First, growing users and deepening engagement per user. Second, continuing to increase ad load driven by the synergies between our users' strong commercial intent and relevant ads. Third, executing on our lower funnel revenue opportunity. And finally, driving demand through third-party partners, resellers, and international markets as additional levers to growth. Our results in Q1 are a testament to how each of these initiatives are performing as we expected or better. And all four of these drivers contributed to the revenue acceleration we saw in the first quarter and the strong outlook we have for the second quarter. In summary, we have multiple ways to win, and we are not overly reliant on any single initiative to achieve our objectives, which gives us confidence to deliver on these long-range targets. And we're driving strong momentum in our business, making it clear that we have shifted into a higher gear as we enter this next stage of growth. As we pass the $500 million MAU milestone, I'd like to take a step back and discuss some of the core initiatives over the past seven quarters that have driven much of the accelerating user growth and deepening engagement we're seeing today. We focused the company on what our users love most about Pinterest, with a particular emphasis on reinvigorating curation and satisfying commercial intent. We leaned heavily into next-gen AI and relevancy improvements. We updated our content strategy to focus on content that satisfies purpose and intent rather than pure entertainment. And we made clear that our shopping strategy was to partner with retailers rather than compete with them. We're now clearly moving at full speed, leaning into the reasons we know users come to Pinterest and making them even better. In doing so, we're finding our best product market fit in years. The drivers of user growth I'll discuss today are consistent with what I've laid out since joining Pinterest and that we elaborated on at our investor day. First, how we're using AI to drive relevance and personalization. Second, doubling down on curation through boards and collages. Third, driving actionability throughout our core surfaces. And lastly, creating a more positive alternative to traditional social media. The results of these efforts are seen in the accelerating growth rate of our monthly active users, the vast majority of whom come directly to our mobile app, deeply engagement per user with engagement growth in excess of user growth, and how we are winning with Gen Z, which is now our largest and fastest growing demographic at more than 40% of our users. It's important to note that our MAU growth acceleration is a result of months and quarters of compounding effects of these initiatives I just described, and we see much more opportunity ahead as we continue improving our core user experience and lean further into the unique and highly differentiated aspects of our platform. Let's start with our investments in AI to drive personalization and relevance. In the second half of 2022, we moved aggressively to implement LLMs and NextGen AI to improve our user experiences. We transitioned from CPU to GPU serving, which allowed us to serve models that were 100 times larger in size. This was the first step to unlocking a better product experience by improving our ability to surface more personalized content for our users. With GPU serving capabilities, we are developing and deploying even more complex models to drive further gains in relevancy and personalization. For example, our recommendation models were previously focused on serving content to drive greater view time in that immediate moment. However, as we've advanced our AI and sharpened our focus on user intent, we've incorporated more proprietary signals into our recommendation models to optimize for depths of engagement and satisfaction of intent, including driving more actual outcomes like saves, clicks, and conversions to help users progress further through their inspiration to action journey. Among these signals are the billions of acts of curation that happen on our platform in a manner that is highly distinct from the rest of social media. This gives us unique insight into user preferences, allowing us to tailor content to suit their needs and help them find their next use case. In summary, not only does our AI keep advancing, but there's also a flywheel effect that takes place. As we train our models on more user signals, we're driving even further relevance in our content recommendations, which then further improves the user signals our AI can act upon. As I mentioned, a key source of user signals is the human curation which takes place on our platform at scale, and we're improving this experience for our users. Our work on curation has been another driver of our user growth and is an integral step in the inspiration to action journey. To help remove the friction for users to begin creating boards, we've added additional board functionality, including auto-organization features. And for those who generally don't organize their saves, this feature resulted in annually 30% lift in boards created, highlighting how auto-organization can unlock the magic of Pinterest for more users. We're also significantly advancing what it means to curate on Pinterest with collages. Powered by our AI and advanced computer vision technology, collages are a powerful curation tool to cut out images and components from a pen and piece together new inspiring content. This greater granularity allows users to express their styles, tastes, and preferences in much more specific and creative ways. This is an entirely new, highly engaging, and highly shoppable content format. Users are roughly three times more likely to save collage pens versus other pens on Pinterest, in a significant portion contain clickable products. We're also continuing to see collages gain traction with Gen Z, who are nearly 70% of collage creators. Furthermore, improving the actionability of pens is another core tent of improving user satisfaction, deeply engagement, and growing MAUs. We know users come to Pinterest to shop, and we've been working to ensure our high-intent audience can find and easily take action on the content they see on Pinterest. We've integrated more shoppable content into our core surfaces, including home feed, search, and related items. For example, our guided shopping modules help users pick up where they left off on prior shopping journeys by resurfacing product pens based on past browsing and click history, while our visual shopping modules, such as Shop Similar and Shop the Look, allow users to shop the items they see within lifestyle images right when they discover them. In Q1, we brought shoppable video to Pinterest as we expanded Shop to Look to video pens. Now, when a user clicks on a video pen, a carousel will appear with shoppable pens that match items in the video. This allows the user to easily shop the items that bring them inspiration in the videos they were already watching. Through these and other efforts to improve the actionability of the platform, we've made it easier and more seamless to shop content on Pinterest, a top priority for our users. And we're seeing users take advantage of the improved actionability as outbound clicks to advertisers accelerated from last quarter, more than doubling year-over-year yet again. As a part of our efforts to grow users and deepen engagement, we're also building a more positive alternative to traditional social media. And we firmly believe that inspiration starts with inclusion. Building on past successes in inclusive product design, like skin tone and hair pattern search in 2023, we added to our suite of inclusive products with our body type ranges. We're also using the inclusive AI that powers these products to increase representation in the content that we show to users by default. And throughout 2023, we refined and implemented this technology across more surfaces so more people can see themselves reflected on Pinterest. Our users love and use these products. For example, the number of users searching with skin tone ranges doubled in the past year, which speaks to the affinity our users have for inclusive products and the work our team is doing to provide a more inspirational experience for everyone. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to win with Gen Z. They are more than 40% of the users on the platform and our largest and fastest growing demographic. Gen Z comes to our platform to get inspired and to shop. They save more than other demographics and also find value in new content formats like collages. And they see Pinterest as a distinct and separate destination from other social media apps. One where they can invest in themselves and refine their interests in smaller forums with closer connections and without the pressures and toxicity that often accompany their time on other social apps. In fact, Gen Z rates Pinterest higher on promoting and preserving well-being metrics like self-worth, belonging, and purpose compared to other traditional social media platforms. As a result, Pinterest is aging down, a rarity in consumer internet applications, which typically age up as they mature. We're also continuing to break through with Gen Z by connecting through culturally relevant moments. For example, we recently hosted an immersive activation at Coachella Music Festival, one of the biggest Gen Z moments of the year, to deepen their connection to Pinterest. Inspired by our festival trends report, we created the Pinterest manifestation, which invited festival goers to turn their favorite festival fashion and beauty dreams to reality with the help of expert makeup artists and stylists. Bringing this together, we've been moving fast and executing with tremendous clarity and focus over the past two years across the themes I've just discussed, which have all compounded to drive our acceleration and user growth. I'm proud of our team for all they've been able to accomplish thus far and look forward to continuing to innovate on behalf of our users. Next, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable and performant for advertisers. We know that people come to Pinterest with intent. Our platform uniquely empowers users to have dynamic, multi-session journeys that take them from inspiration to action. For a long time, Pinterest excelled in upper funnel discovery in connection with the early stages of a user's inspiration to action journey. But Pinterest provided very little ability to take action on items that users found. Now, we're solving for that actionability in the lower funnel. Through seamless connections to retailers like mobile deep linking and direct links, enhanced ad platform capabilities like whole page optimization, and improved adoption of our foundational measurement capabilities like the API for conversions and clean rooms, we've made substantial improvements in executing on our lower funnel roadmap to deliver value for our users and our advertisers. We're seeing the direct impact of increased actionability play out. And the results we delivered this quarter prove this. We've accelerated clicks to advertisers again this quarter, even after more than doubling clicks year-on-year in Q4. And our revenue growth rate nearly doubled from Q4, driven by lower funnel revenue acceleration. Turning to some of the most notable achievements from the quarter, adoption of our lower funnel formats and tools has been a critical part of our monetization strategy. In Q1, we completed our rollout of direct links to our lower funnel ad formats, which now covers 97% of our lower funnel revenue, up from 80% last quarter. Direct links take users to an advertiser's product or purchase page in just one click, significantly reducing friction and improving the ability to take action. The value creation to advertisers has been outstanding, with clicks to advertisers more than doubling year-over-year. The underlying value direct links creates has been clear to us since it launched at the end of Q3, but for advertisers, it takes time to see and measure the results with their own source of truth, their measurement models. We're now seeing the value capture from direct links through increased ad spend, especially from some of the largest, most sophisticated advertisers. Similar to past new product launches like mobile deep links, advertisers who have seen sustained performance gains from direct links and are able to measure the results have started to increase their share of wallow with Pinterest. With some of our most sophisticated advertisers, we are reaching 5% or more of total ad budget, implying an even deeper penetration of their digital ad spend. However, much more of the value capture from direct links remains ahead of us. Many of our advertisers either recently got access to direct links or don't yet have the correct tools to understand their improved Pinterest performance, a process which can take months or quarters. As a result, we expect value capture from these advertisers to continue throughout the year as more of them begin to measure and react to the benefits from direct links. In order to facilitate advertiser adoption of our lower funnel solutions, which drive additional value capture, we've made a number of changes within our sales and go to market functions. For example, we're providing a scaled approach for our global sales force to educate on and implement lower funnel best practices with more technical support to help advertisers meet their specific goals and maximize performance. Turning to measurement, thanks to our improved lower funnel solutions, we're driving more clicks and conversions to advertisers. And through our measurement tools, we're proving this value to advertisers. Our suite of measurement tools starts with advertisers adopting our privacy-centric tools to preserve conversion visibility, which provides them with data to feed their individual models and measure their specific goals. One of our most important initiatives began in earnest in 2023 with our efforts to increase adoption of the API for conversions, which provides a server-to-server connection for advertisers to measure and attribute conversions. I'm pleased to report that we've grown the adoption of the API to nearly 40% of total revenue, up from 28% of total revenue at our investor day last September. As I've mentioned previously, revenue from retail advertisers who have adopted the API for conversions tends to grow significantly faster than revenue from those who have not yet adopted. This trend continued to hold in Q1 and underscores our desire to drive more privacy-centric measurement, particularly to lower funnel advertisers where it's most impactful. We're seeing a reinforcing effect take place. As advertisers adopt and see the benefits of shopping ads, mobile deep linking, or direct links, they are more incentivized to adopt our privacy-centric measurement. To that point, we also see that advertisers who have adopted our full lower funnel tool set, including shopping ads, mobile deep linking, or direct links, and our API for conversions are also growing much faster than those who have no lower funnel solution adoption. As we look ahead to more industry changes, which will affect an advertiser's ability to measure conversions, we are strongly promoting API for conversions adoption to our lower funnel advertisers and our selling efforts, and increasing the amount of variable compensation attached to adoption. We are also focused on meeting advertisers where they are by integrating into their measurement tools of choice, such as clean rooms and over 20 measurement platform integrations. In addition to format and measurement innovations, we remain committed to bringing AI-based automation to the forefront of our campaign creation experience and ads offering to drive performance for our advertisers. In fact, 2023 was a strong year for ads innovation as we accelerated our product delivery and launched more ad formats, tools, and solutions than in any year in our history. We've seen a lot of success with our current automation tools and we're investing to build out this suite in order to give advertisers an array of tools to build, optimize, manage, and measure campaigns on Pinterest. Today, our automated suite of performance features includes tools such as automated bidding, expanded targeting, and flexible daily budgets. Each of these automation offerings helps to drive more efficient campaigns on Pinterest. As of Q1, we continue to see revenue coverage above 80% for automated bidding, while over half of our revenue utilizes either expanded targeting or flexible daily budgets. However, there's still significant room for us to go and driving further revenue coverage of our entire automation suite, which, when adopted, results in compounding positive impacts on campaign performance. To drive further uptake, we plan to launch a campaign creation tool to simplify setup for our automated offerings and removes friction for advertisers to leverage these tools. We're also building out additional automation components to drive greater campaign efficiency for advertisers. We will release these features in stages and as with other new launches they will go through a typical product ramp as we develop, test, and scale ultimately creating a more robust suite of automation tools to improve advertiser performance. Let me touch on a couple of the new offerings we're expecting to roll out over the coming quarters. First, we're launching our dynamic creative optimization solution set which will allow advertisers to use generative AI to optimize the creative for their ads. Overtime we'll personalize this technology using signals that are unique to Pinterest. Such that the imagery users see will be tailored to their own interests and aesthetics. We'll also be introducing row ad bidding. This solution will seek to increase advertiser return on ad spend by automatically optimizing campaigns in real time to prioritize users or products that drive the highest ROI. This rollout is a continuation of automation features we've already been delivering so that ultimately advertisers will be able to provide us with a budget, a goal, and their seed creative and we'll do the rest. We'll manage bidding, targeting, and dynamic creative at scale all in service of delivering the best possible performance for our advertisers. Next, I want to provide an update on our third party demand efforts. Consistent with our commentary from the start, our goal in developing these partnerships is to complement our first party demand and round out demand gaps in our auction. We are currently scaling third party demand with two partners, Amazon Ads in the U.S. and Google Ads Manager, which recently went live in February in unmonetized international markets. Our Amazon partnership is live on all of our main surfaces in the U.S. and we are continuing to optimize our respective systems to improve relevance and drive performance for advertisers. Additionally, our Google partnership, while early, is also progressing nicely. In Q1, as expected, we saw an emerging contribution to revenue from third party demand and we anticipate this will be the base from which further third party revenue will grow throughout the year. We continue to see opportunities to expand our current partnerships to multiple geographies and for multiple partners to exist within the same market. Consistent with what we laid out at our investor day, we also have an opportunity to grow our revenue in international markets and are employing a multi-prong strategy to do so. In our largest international markets, we are using first party selling efforts to strategically capture advertiser demand. We're also deepening our partnership with agencies to grow within these markets. In smaller markets, where we previously had not monetized or are under monetized, we are introducing additional sources of demand to fill in gaps in our auction. In addition to third party demand from Google, this quarter we will begin working with resellers to bring in local ad demand, primarily in rest of world markets. Resellers provide a scaled approach to drive demand in markets where we don't currently have a sales presence and can bring relevant ad content for users in those markets. Like any new selling effort, demand from resellers will take time to grow in these markets and therefore we expect this initiative to ramp over the course of the year. Our third strategic priority has been a continued focus on operational rigor and discipline. As I mentioned before, I'm extremely proud of our team's continued strong execution, as evidenced by our ability to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 1,100 basis points in Q1, while also accelerating product innovation and product market fit. Now I'll turn the call over to Julia to share more details about our financial performance. Thanks, Julia. I want to thank our team at Pinterest, our advertising partners, and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration in the shop. And with that, we can open the call up for questions. Thanks, Brian. On your first question, we were really pleased with the revenue acceleration we saw this quarter leading us to come in above the high end of our guidance range. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and that we talked about it yesterday as well, we've got multiple ways to win and drive revenue. And we're seeing broad-based strength across all of these initiatives, all of which are performing generally as we expected or better. First of all, continued strong amount of engagement growth on the platform. We're seeing the best product market fit we've seen in years, not only growing MAU, but deepening engagement even as we accelerate the rate of user ads on the platform. And we're doing that synergistically with ad load. We are demonstrating that because our users have commercial intent, ads can be relevant content on the platform. Second, on monetization, strength in the lower funnel driven by our shopping ads and direct links value capture, a strong contributor. There's particular strength in U.S. and retail where we're taking share and starting to get more access into performance budgets. And that's really driven by the fact that we, again, doubled the number of clicks to advertiser's year-on-year. We doubled the number of clicks to advertisers in Q4, and more than doubled the number of clicks to advertisers again in Q1, and actually accelerated from Q4. So that's really driving that penetration into those performance budgets and driving strength in U.S. and retail. And as I mentioned, we saw an emerging contribution in Q1 from our 3P partnerships, which are ramping, and which helped to complement the really strong growth that we're seeing in first party demand. So it really is broad based. All of those contributed to the acceleration in Q1, and we see that continuing as we think about the Q2 revenue guidance as well. And with that, I'll give it over to Julia for your second question. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Eric. Well, what I'd say is, if you look over the past seven quarters, I think we have demonstrably improved our competitive positioning across the board. You look at our growth rate in users, the fact that users grew across every geography, we continue to deepen engagement per user, and that really speaks to just how much the greater actionability that we're driving for our users, both on shopping and on curation, is causing deeper user engagement in the platform that's really been driven by both AI advancements and the unique signal on our platform where people curate on our platform. So we just get truly unique signal that doesn't exist anyplace else where users spend hours and hours and hours refining their interest, curating their interest, and we understand their interest at a depth that you just couldn't understand otherwise. As the AI acts upon that, it lets us drive much more relevant recommendations. And so, yes, you have general competition and large models, but we also have completely unique signal that we're able to train those models on that unique signal and you see that evidence in the relevancy improvements we made. Same on the ad side. For advertisers, we're able to bring them users in a highly commercial moment where they have intent but have not yet decided what to buy. So it's greater commercial intent than you would see elsewhere in social, but it's also bringing more of the inspiration than what you would typically find on other very low funnel moments. So I think that's demonstrating that we have a unique space to be occupied with the user where they see us as something distinct and separate from the rest of social media, where social media tends to be lean back entertainment, we have lean forward commercial intent. We are still early in our journey and what we can get from that, we see a multi-year journey ahead as to how we continue to refine and make that better. And then that cuts through to advertisers where we're delivering very strong performance to advertisers. Doubling the number of clicks year-on-year is exceptional. Our advertisers see that as exceptional, and as Julia noted, more of the value capture from that still lies ahead of us versus behind us, and we think there's more runway to go in driving more and more commerciality on our platforms. We feel really well positioned in a unique space, and as AI continues to advance, we're able to adopt off-the-shelf large language models, tune those to our unique signals, and then get very unique results because of the very distinct, unique signals we get on our platform because of the human curation at scale on our platform. Yes, certainly. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we launched direct links at the very tail end of Q3. So really, Q4 is when we first started to see its effect. We continue to ramp that through Q1. We now have 97% of our lower funnel revenue has adopted the direct links format. And our conversion for our API for conversion is now covering 40% of revenue. So, the effect that, both Julie and I have talked about is that there's a lag effect between the value that we create for advertisers when we start to send them more clicks and send them better conversions and better return, and when they're able to see that flow through to their models and measurement systems, which typically has sometimes a quarter or multi-quarter lag effect, particularly if they haven't implemented measurement. So, when we say that we see more of the value capture still in front of us than behind us, we clearly see that value capture happening with direct links. We've seen budgets shift. As I mentioned, in my remarks that we're seeing, particularly with some of the larger, more sophisticated advertisers that pick up these changes very quickly, we're seeing that they have shifted budgets and that we are now, capturing 5% or more of total budget, which imply a much deeper penetration of their digital budget and going into their performance budgets, whereas historically, Pinterest would have been oftentimes in sort of experimental or social budgets. We're now shifting more into those always-on performance budgets and doing quite well there. But, that broad-based adoption of the measurement tools that let the advertisers see it and then their shift of budget, we see more of that in front of us than behind us, but that's what gives us confidence, our ability to continue delivering because we know that we're delivering the clicks to those advertisers. And then the second part of your question around the automation suite for those advertisers, we have delivered some of the most important components of a full automation suite, like the fact that we have 80% plus our revenue going through automated bidding. But we have some other really meaningful components that are still in front of us, like dynamic creative optimization, which we'll be launching and ramping over the coming quarters, and ROAS-level bidding, which is also going to be launching and ramping over the coming quarters. So these are things that say, okay, we know there's a compounding effect of delivering more clicks and conversions to the advertisers, giving them more ability to measure it, and then making it easier and easier for them to create sort of set it and forget it campaigns that deliver them great ROI. All those things have a compounding effect. And with each one of those, we've got clear elements of the potential of that, but then we're driving more and more of that adoption, which is what gives us confidence in the continued adoption ahead. And, finally, I just mentioned, I talked about some in my remarks, everything that we've talked about here is consistent with what I've said since I joined, what we outlined at our investor day. These things have compounding benefits over time. So don't expect like big bang moments on these things. But you saw us hit a new gear from H1 to H2 last year. We doubled our growth rate from H1 to H2 last year. You're seeing us do it again as we come into this quarter and project forward into next quarter in the Q2. And so those are compounding benefits. And so expect that similar kind of behavior that the benefits just continue to compound versus, one big hockey stick moment in a particular quarter. Hopefully that helps. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Ross. Yes. We feel great about our competitive positioning. We think we have a unique and distinct use case for our users. And we have strong commercial intent and we're now delivering more and more of that performance for advertisers. And we see those advertisers shifting budget to us and notably, moving us into those performance budgets, those always on budgets versus the experimental area that Pinterest historically played in. And I'd say what's fueling that, again, is the uniqueness of the use case we solve for our users. But also as you think about the way that AI plays out, I do think this first wave of AI or some of the first conversations in AI were about, value accruing to the model creators and those who have like the largest general purpose models. I think it's also the case that there's a distinct set of value creation around both fit for purpose models and taking unique signal, applying it to those larger models. And you see us doing both. We have taken off the shelf larger models. We then train them on our unique user signal that lets us, you know, I talked about on prior quarters called 10 full percentage points improvement and user relevancy. So you see us doing those kinds of things. You also see us doing things with our own foundational models like really unique computer vision work where we have one of the largest image corpuses [ph] out there. We have really unique signal about how users associate those images, styling outfits and styling rooms and things like that. And that's let us train fit for purpose models. So we feel really good about our ability to compete both in terms of a unique space for the user, delivering great value for advertisers, leading them to shift share to us. And we think there's more of that to go as they're just now starting to measure and see that and shift budgets. And from an AI perspective, we feel really well positioned in terms of the uniqueness of the signal we get through the human curation on our platform. As we're leaning into that, we're seeing that accelerate as well through things like our collage format, which is driving three times the engagement, approximately three times the engagement of traditional pens. So we think that's an entirely new content type on Pinterest that is unique to what people do on Pinterest, fueled by AI and has this flywheel effect of feeding us more and more granular signals that let us train our AI to do unique things that don't occur on other platforms. So all that to say, yes, we feel good. It's a competitive space. It always will be. But we feel well positioned and I think reflected in our results Yes on international, I'd say again more the opportunities in front of us than behind us. I talked about the Google 3P partnership is just getting going. So that wasn't really a contributor in this quarter. We see more of that as we look ahead. I'd say stepping back more broadly the shopping improvements that we have made, the lower funnel improvements we have made. Of course, we started with our home market our largest market first, and we're now taking more of those things international, and you can see [Technical Difficulty] Yes, I think about now back on so great. Thank you apologies for the technical glitch there So we see that those shopping improvements that we've made starting in the U.S. that now as we're just starting to take them international that that's resonating with users as well. So when you look at our MAU acceleration we saw accelerated user growth in every geography that speaks to how broad based the product improvements are from a user perspective And then now we're taking those advertiser tools and those markets [Indiscernible] shopability in the low funnel, both from a 1P perspective as well as just starting with our 3P and reseller efforts I talked about as well. So we see much more that opportunity international still in front of us. Great. Yes. Well, I would say, our growth and strength has been most pronounced in lower funnel particularly in U.S. retail and amongst the largest most sophisticated advertisers, but we do see that starting to broaden out as sort of other retailers adopt the ability to do privacy safe measurement. As I will see that flow through the models, we see that starting to flow through to a broader set of retailers as well. So we have, our business is less SMB centric, but we do see that our improvements in shopability are benefiting a broad swath of retailers from the largest all the way through to smaller retailers as well. So we think more the value capture today is occurring with the largest most sophisticated. There is faster to react but when we say there's like a multi-core adoption curve on these things that will start to take us deeper and deeper into sort of midsize and smaller retailers as well. So hope that helps give you a little bit of color on that part of it. Yes on the third party side of it, 3P is doing exactly what we expected it to do. And if you step back, when we introduced 3P about a year ago, we were excited to announce our first third-party partnership with Amazon ads then. And when we first introduced 3P, we talked about the opportunity for 3P to work in parallel with 1P to round out gaps in our auction, leading to greater relevancy and shopability for our users. And ultimately, improved monetization. And of course, we've also been investing heavily in our 1P business, even as we introduced the 3P opportunity. And we talked about how we believe that creating numerous ways to win, driving a balanced, durable top-line growth, where this would be a compliment for auction, that that was the approach we were taking. And so, when we've talked about 3P efforts as a compliment, it's not that we believe that we're any less excited to see the long-term potential any less. It's just we're also seeing significant accelerating strength in our 1P business. So our 1P is rounding out those gaps in our auction, bringing much more auction density. And then 3P is contributing nicely to that as a compliment as well. So again, we see that playing out, as we had expected in terms of complimenting our 1P demand, bringing more density to the auction, creating greater shopability. It is broad-based because we see broad-based strength in retail, both 1st-party and 3P as an emerging contributor to that. And as I mentioned in my comments, we expect that where we are now on 3P is a base from which we'll continue to grow as we optimize further and further with our partners and look forward to how we'll bring in more demand to compliment our auction. Hope that helps. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Mark. So again, we're just getting going with our 3P efforts. Again, we feel that those are performing in line with our expectations from what we've talked about previously. We're just starting on the international side. Google's certainly a great first partner there, but we're just getting going. And as we carry forward, we think about, we're always looking at this as sort of a retail problem. You have the right products on the shelves when the user walks in. And so we're always looking at where do we need more density? Where do we need more shoppable inventory to round out what the user is looking for? And we'll continue to look at what are the best partners to round that out. As you noted, we've brought in some really great partners already. We see really phenomenal momentum in our first-party business, which is always what you would hope to see first and foremost. But we'll continue to look at how we round out those get-ups. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities to expand our current partnerships to multiple geographies versus the geographies that are in today. And we're continuously evaluating additional partners that can complement the auction going forward. So obviously, I'm not going to comment on any new partner before we have a new partner signed up. We're continuously evaluating those. And even though it's been a nice, 3P has been a nice emerging contributor, we're just getting going internationally. And we see a lot more opportunity to continue on that effort. And then I'll give to Julia for your second question. Alright, thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. As always we look forward to keeping this dialogue going. And we hope you enjoy the rest of your day."
