I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and to provide an overview of our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q4, supported by expanding global demand for companion animal health care. Revenue increased 19% as reported and 17% organically, driven by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth sustained at high levels across U.S. and international markets through the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong clinical visit growth trends and increased utilization of diagnostics. Flow-through operating margin benefits from high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported achievement of $2.01 in EPS, which included a $0.25 nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 in tax benefit from stock-based compensation activity. Strong CAG growth results and proactive cost controls supported delivery of outstanding full year 2020 financial performance, above our long-term goals. IDEXX achieved 12% full year organic revenue growth, driven by nearly 15% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 25.7%, an increase of 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The combination of high revenue growth and operating margin gains supported delivery of full year EPS of $6.71 per share, an increase of 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Robust CAG market trends position us for continued strong financial performance in 2021. Today, we're providing our initial outlook for full year revenue growth and key financial metrics and an expanded information table shown in our press release and snapshot. Highlights include an outlook for 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 12% to 14.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our financial outlook reflects a targeted 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable constant currency basis, building on strong 2020 performance. These gains are projected to support 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth, aligned with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2021 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and recent market trends. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 17% was driven by 21% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 22% gains in international markets. Strong overall organic growth was also supported by 13% organic gains in our LPD business and approximately $10 million or 1.5% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 test initiatives. Overall, organic growth was moderated by pandemic related pressures, which constrained water revenue growth and contributed to a 10% year-on-year decline in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the fourth quarter. CAG growth dynamics remain healthy across global markets with 20% or higher CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue gains achieved in the North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. For the full year 2020, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth increased an impressive 15% in both U.S. and international markets. High U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains continue to be aided by strong growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth reached 8% in Q4, up from 6% growth in Q3, reflecting sustained 10% growth in wellness visits and higher 10% growth in non-wellness visits. A factor continuing to support high clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added 1.5% to 2% to overall clinical visit growth and 2.5% to 3% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported a 12% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4, well ahead of an improved 4% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. These positive market dynamics and benefits from investments in IDEXX's commercial capability, wellness program initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care drove high Q4 and full year organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 19% organically in Q4 led by nearly 20% organic growth in the U.S. and mid to high teens organic growth in international markets. Reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories, including support from high levels of wellness testing in the U.S. and benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements in international markets. For the full year 2020, global lab revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting mid-teen organic gains in the U.S., and approximately 10% growth overall in international markets. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 25% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting high growth across U.S. and international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium installed base. These dynamics supported a 19% full-year growth in IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2020. While CAG instrument placements continue to be constrained by pandemic impacts restricted \u2013 restricting sales access to vet clinics, trends have improved solidly over the second half of 2020. In Q4, CAG instrument revenues were $3 million below strong prior year levels, representing a 10% year-over-year organic revenue decline. Overall global Catalyst placements in Q4 were 13% below strong prior year levels, which included high levels of international upgrades. While overall placement levels were constrained to a degree by the pandemic, the quality of CAG instrument placements remained high. Globally, placements at new and competitive accounts were down approximately 4% compared to strong prior year levels. These results reflected 414 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 1,092 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also placed 525 second Catalysts globally to support high-growth with our customers. New placements and continued high customer retention levels drove a 13% year-on-year increase in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 1,224 premium hematology placements in Q4, supporting a 10% year-on-year expansion in our premium hematology installed base. We also placed 671 SediVue analyzers, bringing our global SediVue installed base to nearly 10,700 instruments, up 20% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q4, driven by high-growth in the U.S., aligned with broader gains in demand for diagnostic testing, including robust gains in clinical wellness business. For the full year 2020, rapid assay organic revenue growth was 9%, reflecting strong volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. We're planning for similar levels of net price improvement in CAG recurring revenues in 2021. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 1% organically overall in the fourth quarter. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging system placement levels. For the full year 2020, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 3% organically, as strong gains in software services were offset by pandemic-related pressure on new imaging system placements. Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues posted modest organic growth in Q4, as solid gains in compliance testing were offset by pandemic-related pressure on non-compliance-related activity. These impacts contributed to a 2% organic decline in full year 2020 Water revenues. While recent trends in our Water business have improved relatively, we're planning for uneven demand in non-compliance testing in 2021, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 13% organically in Q4, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Better-than-expected LPD results reflected high demand for diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever and gains in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains offset lower herd health screening levels in export markets compared to strong prior year results. For the full year, LPD revenues increased 11% organically. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect to see constraints on LPD growth rates as we lap the benefits of the 2020 step-up in revenues from expanded African Swine Fever testing programs. Turning to the P&, operating profit results were very strong in Q4 reflecting flow-through from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. As a reminder, prior year operating profit results were impacted by $13 million in CEO transition charges. Normalizing for these impacts, operating profits increased 43% year-on-year in Q4 on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting 460 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement. Gross profit increased 24% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results reflected productivity gains in our lab operations supported by high organic lab revenue growth as well as favorable net mix impacts from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Operating expenses in Q4 increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the 2019 CEO transition charges. Relatively accelerated operating expense growth reflected higher incentive compensation and healthcare costs as well as increased investment in R&D and enhancement of our global CAG commercial capability. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong global growth momentum. For the full year 2020, operating margins reached 25.7%, up 270 basis points as reported and 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting high CAG Diagnostic revenue growth and benefit from cost controls. As highlighted in our initial guidance for 2021, we're targeting to build on this strong performance as we advance high return investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. The EPS in Q4 was $2.01 per share, including $0.25 per share in non-recurring tax benefit and $0.13 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2020, EPS was $6.71, up 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Full year EPS results also included $39 million or $0.45 per share and tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 590 basis points of effective tax rate benefit and $22 million or 330 basis points of effective tax rate benefit from the non-recurring tax item. In terms of other factors impacting our reported results, foreign exchange effects have turned favorable given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4, FX added nearly 2% to revenue growth and $1 million to operating profit net of Q4 hedge losses of approximately $2 million. For the full year 2020, foreign exchange rates decreased EPS by $0.06 per share, net of FX hedge gains of $1 million. Free cash flow was $541 million for 2020. Free cash flow conversion was 93% of net income or 97% adjusted for our investments at our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation, which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended 2020 with leverage ratios of 1.1 times gross and 0.64 times net of cash with $384 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but we have reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, reflecting confidence in our long-term growth strategy. Turning to our 2021 outlook. As noted, we've included a table in our press release and snapshot reflecting our initial outlook for revenue growth and other key financial metrics, recognizing that it remains a relatively dynamic environment in terms of financial forecasting. Our initial overall organic revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% is centered on an estimated organic growth range of 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As a benchmark, this recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021, building on strong 2020 momentum and a premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinical visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points, which is consistent with our strong growth trends heading into the pandemic. Our growth outlook range reflects our plans to drive continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth globally while also recognizing each year-on-year comparisons to very strong 2020 growth levels in the second half of the year. In terms of overall organic growth, we factored in an estimated 1% overall growth benefit from higher CAG Diagnostic capital instrument revenues, including net growth benefits from the ProCyte One launch this year. These positive impacts are expected to be moderated by tougher comparisons in our LPD business and continued COVID related growth pressures in certain areas such as water noncompliance testing demand. Please note that given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter with expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're targeting 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable constant currency operating margin improvement in 2021. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 27.3% to 27.8%. We're planning for continued solid momentum from gross margin gains with some moderation and benefits related to product mix impacts and increased lab staffing to support high-volume growth. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong growth trends. We also expect some relative year-on-year increases in costs in certain areas such as employee health care costs, claims and travel costs as pandemic related restrictions are eased. Our outlook incorporates projection for foreign exchange to be a net positive factor in 2021 at recent exchange rates. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate FX will provide a positive 1.5% to 2% revenue growth impact in 2021 and approximately $0.14 of EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. We've included an outlook for net interest expense that assumes maintenance of a relatively consistent net leverage ratio in 2021. Given reduced share repurchase activity in 2020; we're projecting more limited year-on-year EPS growth benefit from reductions in average shares outstanding. Our 2021 outlook includes an estimated $0.09 to $0.11 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity compared to a much higher than anticipated $0.45 per share benefit in 2020. Our 2021 estimates reflect known option expirations and any established 10b5-1 plans. In terms of managing our 2021 financial performance, our focus will be on delivering strong full year results, while advancing our long-term growth strategy prudently in a dynamic environment. Given the strong momentum in our CAG business, we're inclined to lean in towards high-return organic growth-oriented investments while delivering continued improvement in operating margins, aligned with our long-term goals. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2020, driven by exceptional CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Strong CAG market trends continued through Q4, enabling us to deliver outstanding full year performance with 12% overall organic growth, significant expansion of our operating margins, 31% EPS growth on a comparable constant currency basis and 55% return on invested capital. While managing through pandemic impacts, we deepened our connection with our customers, strengthened our global commercial capability and advanced key elements of our innovation agenda. These steps position us well to build on our business momentum in 2021. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our markets and some of the dynamics that are supporting the impressive growth rates we've achieved in our core business. I'll also provide an update on some of our key growth initiatives in areas of emphasis this year. Finally, I'll discuss how we plan to manage the business, aligned with our initial financial outlook in what remains a dynamic macro environment. Let's begin with an update on market trends. We continue to see strong growth trends in Companion Animal healthcare reflected in high-growth in same-store clinical visits in the U.S., higher growth in new patients and an accelerated expansion of care. We also saw sustained solid market recovery across international markets, despite pandemic impacts. As Brian noted, clinical visits were up 8% overall in the U.S. in Q4, led by wellness visit growth of 10% and strong non-wellness, same-store growth of 7%. For the full year, clinical visit growth was approximately 3%, consistent with the growth we have seen in recent years, though with wide variations by quarter due to pandemic effects. Solid U.S. market growth trends have continued into early 2021. Market feedback from veterinarians remains consistent. Clinics are very busy with sustained high levels of demand supported by higher growth in new patients. Our market data tracking in the U.S. indicates a 10% increase in new clinical patients in 2020 versus 2019 growth of 3%, which contributed an estimated 1.5% to 2% of incremental overall same-store clinical visit growth in Q4. There continues to be evidence reinforcing robust growth in the pet population. As an indicator, we've seen a 70% year-over-year growth in IDEXX progesterone test revenue in the second half of 2020 in the U.S., as well as a significant step-up in new clinical patients with first-time pet parents. New patient growth has been augmented by the accelerated expansion of care. Overall revenue generated during clinical visits grew 15% per practice in the U.S. in Q4, driving 12% total revenue growth per practice. Diagnostics revenue is growing even faster at approximately 17.5% per practice in Q4 in the U.S. supporting full year 2020 same-store diagnostics revenue per practice increase of 12%, reflecting a significant step-up in growth in the second half of the year. We saw a clear trend of veterinarians performing more diagnostics in 2020, with average diagnostics revenue per clinical visit with diagnostics up 5% for the year. There are a number of potential drivers for this, which we've noted in recent calls. Pet owners are spending more time with pets during the pandemic. They may be more attuned to their health conditions and care. Curbside checking procedures may also be helping, as pet owners pre-approve diagnostic test runs, as required prior to the visit, helping veterinarians and their staff to provide higher standards of care. And veterinarians continue to pivot the focus on delivering medical services as their core value proposition. We\u2019ve leveraged the strong market backdrop into even faster growth for our business, enabled by our commercial capabilities, clinical innovations and customer-friendly marketing programs. For the full year in 2020, the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth premium compared to clinical visit growth expanded to approximately 1,200 basis points in the U.S., up from the 900 to 1,000 basis point range heading into the pandemic. This is a healthy backdrop for our business in 2021. We're planning to support high growth in our CAG business, recognizing there continues to be significant unknown dynamics in the marketplace and the economy as we advance to the next phase of pandemic management. We believe our initial revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic growth and 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, represents a reasonable planning range in this context. There is considerable momentum in the market to continue expanding utilization of pet healthcare, and our strategy is to work with our veterinary partners through an expanded commercial presence to raise the standard of care through adoption of our testing innovations. A great example of our innovation focus is ProCyte One, our next-generation hematology point-of-care instrument, which is now in its final stages before product launch. ProCyte One will support a global commercial strategy by unlocking broader opportunity and reach to the customer, especially internationally. Veterinarians want chemistry and hematology diagnostics together, and they are busier than ever, making diagnostic solutions delivered with a best-in-class experience, highly relevant. Field trial customers are thrilled with ProCyte One\u2019s streamlined functionality in a compact footprint. With IDEXX 360 access to in-house hematology is easy and affordable, and our paper run and auto replenishment consumables model makes inventory and cash flow management hassle-free. Customer experience trials are proceeding well, and we anticipate beginning analyzer shipments in North America late Q1, but maybe early Q2. As we complete customer experience trials. We will follow with an international rollout beginning of Q2. Our expectation is to build volume throughout 2021. Pre-sale efforts led by our commercial and marketing organizations are raising awareness of our new hematology analyzer, as well as an increased appreciation of our existing world class hematology portfolio. This is generating interest in in-clinic hematology solutions and driving strong hematology placements. Another key area of innovation leverage is urine analysis. Our commercial teams continue to raise awareness about our SediVue\u2019s enhanced capabilities. Now with advanced bacteria detection. Determining whether bacteria are present or not is often the most important part of sediment analysis. Bacterial UTIs are, for example, a common diagnosis that is painful for pets and could be stressful for pet owners. With SediVue's advanced bacteria detection kit, veterinarians have accessed the real-time bacteria detection of the practice, providing early visibility to the absence or presence of bacteria. Customers highly value diagnostic solution for help them practice better medicine. In this case, allowing them to make more informed decisions within the patient window. We also saw strong interest in our SediVue platform in international markets in 2020, driving a greater than 50% increase year-over-year in our installed base outside of North America. Innovations delivered through our technology for life strategy continued to drive greater adoption for our SediVue platform. Innovation can take many forms. And our digital cytology offering is an example of a new personalized service enabled through imaging technology and our global team of over 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We are pleased with the exceptional feedback and world-class customer satisfaction ratings, point-of-care digital cytology following its launch in Q1 of 2020. Customers are realizing efficiency and clinical benefits in the integrated 24/7/365 service by opening additional appointments in their schedules and enabling same-day treatment plans. Patient results are integrated with major practice management systems with VetConnect PLUS, as well as being available on any iPhone or Android mobile device with the VetConnect PLUS app. It's a great example of how we uniquely support in an integrated way customer clinical and workflow needs. Most of the point-of-care digital cytology placements have been part of a program and almost one-third were combined with premium IDEXX VetLab analyzers. Many placements were important factors in attracting new business for our reference labs. With some customers, we have seen instrument placements accelerate cytology utilization and support strong revenue growth in that category. We'll continue to watch these trends closely as placements expand and more practices fully adopt the instruments into their daily workflow. Now let's transition to an update on our commercial accomplishments and initiatives. Our outstanding results couldn't be accomplished without disciplined commercial execution, which we have highlighted in the past as an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy. We see high returns in investments that allow us to spend more time with customers in person or virtually. As we've noted on the last call, leveraging a long history of U.S. expansions, we have made excellent progress with efforts to significantly expand our commercial footprint in three international country markets. We are on track to complete the expansion and have all new talent hired, trained and onboarded in the first half of this year. We completed our latest U.S. sales force expansion about a year ago now, and the team has ramped productivity, building customer relationships and tenure against customer access pressured from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's performance was exceptional, and instrument placement levels continued to improve sequentially in Q4. They remain somewhat constrained due to the restricted access to clinics and veterinary practice priorities focused on supporting high patient demand. In North America, overall premium instrument placements reached prior year levels, and Catalyst placements were up 14% year-over-year in Q4, including strong second Catalyst placements. These results were achieved while access to practices in-person visits by our customer account managers sustained at Q3 levels or 50% of in-person visits. In international markets, we had high levels of new and competitive catalyst placements, almost reaching prior year levels and second catalyst placements more than doubled prior year levels despite a modest pullback in customer account manager in-person visits in Europe. IDEXX 360 continues to gain significant traction in major international markets, supporting customer acquisition and placements of full VetLab suites as well as increased reference lab usage to support customer volume commitments. While we expect that sales professionals access to veterinary clinics will likely continue to be challenged until social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are relaxed, we are very pleased with our high level of commercial execution. Our expanded global commercial resources positions us well to pursue the vast opportunities we see in international markets and advance initiatives like preventive care in the U.S. We continue to see tremendous customer interest in establishing and expanding preventive care as an important category of pet healthcare practice. The IDEXX Preventive Care program has never been more timely as practices implement a customer-centric Preventive Care program to support the high levels of wellness visit growth and the growth of puppies and kittens we see in the market. Veterinarians view preventive care as a means to both deliver better pet health care and build healthy relationships with new and existing pet owners. Program enrollments in Q4 were approximately 300 newly enrolled customers, more in line with pre-COVID run rates, bringing our total enrolled practice levels to now over 4,800. Our software portfolio also had an exceptional year with a record-breaking number of PIMS placements globally, and over 20% growth in North America for the full year. The expansion of our PIMS installed base and cloud-based subscription customers supported strong double-digit growth in our software and services recurring revenues. Our cloud-based solutions, in general, continue to enjoy excellent momentum. For example, we now have over 5,300 customers utilizing our IDEXX Web PACS offering, an 18% increase year-over-year. We continue to center our software strategy on our customer workflow and clinical needs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the need for cloud-based mobile-centric solutions that deliver deep data insights and tools to further elevate patient care and enable practice efficiency. Investing in high-quality workflow solutions will continue to be an area of focus for us. Next, I'd like to highlight the remarkable operational accomplishments of our supply chain and reference lab teams, supporting our customers in an uninterrupted fashion, while keeping up with 20%-plus organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. Take our reference lab business, for example. Throughout 2020, not only has the team focused on keeping approximately 2,800 on-site reference lab employees at 80 global lab sites safe but did this while sharing continuity and a positive customer experience in an operating environment where transportation and logistics networks were at times highly challenged. And they didn't miss a beat opening our new Court Westland facility. It has been open since May and is operating exceptionally well. Notably, it is achieving record number of lab assessments for our European business. Before I conclude today's remarks, I want to highlight our efforts to make positive and lasting impacts on the communities we serve. As we announced on the last call, we recently established the IDEXX Foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund to support activities aligned with our purpose. Our mission is to create positive lasting impact for people, animals and the environment through inclusive and outcomes-focused initiatives. An area of focus that support the advancement of diversity in the veterinary profession by providing access to learning opportunities, I'm proud to share our inaugural, multiyear engagement with Tuskegee College of Veterinary Medicine, which has been recognized as the most diverse veterinary medical school in the U.S. and has educated more than 70% of the nation's African-American veterinarians. The IDEXX Tuskegee Scholars' Fund will support nine fully funded scholarships, as well as wellbeing and mental health support programs for veterinary students. We are excited about this important initiative in support of our purpose and mission. Before we turn to Q&A, I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our employees for a superb year in pursuit of our purpose. 2020 was a year like we've never experienced, a disruptive year that challenged all levels of the organization. We maintained the operating rhythm in the business, while responding with agility as circumstances required. The team's resilience is a testament to the purpose-driven and innovative culture at IDEXX. The organization stayed focused on serving our customers in an exceptional way while achieving a new high for employee engagement. I couldn't be prouder and more grateful for the teamwork, collaboration and professionalism that resulted in record performance in the face of unknowable challenges. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Bank of America, we have Michael Ryskin. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, Jay, Brian, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter, first of all. I want to start with your comments on the guide and the outlook going forward, and that's where we've had the most feedback from investors and where most of the attention is. If you think about what you guys said about clinical visit growth next year, other parts of the revenue bridge, things of diagnostics utilization, they're more in line with 2020 as a whole but still a little bit of a step-down sequentially just from what we're seeing in 3Q 2020, 4Q 2020, with clinical visits being up mid to high single digits. So I'm just wondering, when we think about those components of the bridge, of the revenue bridge for next year, are you baking any conservatism in the second half, or does this reflect a little bit of your views of something like we would refer to pre-COVID landscape, especially once the vaccines are rolled out and you go back to normal? I guess my question is, what are your thoughts on these COVID tailwinds we've seen in the second half of this year and how that continues next year and beyond?\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. Mike, why don't I start off, and then I'm sure Jay can weigh in on the broader trends. I think we feel we've got a very healthy growth range, as you know, for the full year on the CAG DX recurring of a 12 to 14.5. And I think the higher end of the range on top of the growth rate we had this year, we think, is a very healthy outlook for our business. I think for \u2013 we do feel good about the momentum entering the first half. I think we'll have relatively stronger growth in the first half. And I think you're highlighting the key question, which is the comparison in the second half, there was a step-up in the growth rate and driven by a number of factors, more pets, more testing, some pent-up demand that they've carried over from the early COVID impact. So I think we're just recognizing that there will be some year-over-year compare dynamics that go on that we'll learn more about as we go into the year. But I think we're \u2013 we feel very good about the momentum in the business. It was an amazing 2020, amazing recovery for the industry. And I think the \u2013 our high growth outlook reflects that.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So I would just add to that. The logic of our guidance is linked to the market data. So we are optimistic about the outlook that the benefits will sustain. And I think Brian aptly painted the parameters of that. What we're seeing is we're seeing more pets in the marketplace. We're seeing those are driving more clinical visits, including first-time clinical visits with first-time pet parents. And veterinarians are providing more medical services beyond just the first time clinical visits. And medical services are enabled by diagnostics. You have to first diagnose before you treat. So it's a \u2013 I think it's a very healthy backdrop. And as Brian said, it is still a dynamic environment, and we'll see how it plays out.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks. Can I ask a quick follow-up on that as well is you touched on the ProCyte One launch. You gave us some color on sort of the rollout in 1Q, 2Q. I'm just wondering, are you baking in any specific contribution from ProCyte One from image review for any of the product launches in 2021. And also just \u2013 could you provide a little bit more color on feedback you may have gotten from sort of the pre-launch early customers as far as how that affected your outlook for the full launch?\nJay Mazelsky: Sure, I'll describe the customer experience trials, and then I'll hand it off to Brian to talk about the impact in terms of how we factored it into the forecast. The customer experience trials have done extremely well. I think customers are thrilled with not just the compact footprint but the usability and the very ease of the use of the analyzer. From that standpoint it varies the breakthrough because hematology is a complicated diagnostic testing category. And by the way, the \u2013 these customer experience trials, it's something that is best-in-class in terms of the approach that we take. You can develop an amazing analyzer but you have to put it out in real environments and environments that our customers use to get the type of feedback. We're also \u2013 the other thing that it's driving is just an increased focus on hematology, in the importance of hematology. We know many of our markets are hematology-first markets and \u2013 meaning that they place relative priority on hematology testing even before chemistry. So we're optimistic. We think it's going to be a winner for us. We think that there are over or approximately 100,000 placement opportunities on a global basis. So we're very excited about it. And Brian, why don't you describe how we factored it into our forecast?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. We're not breaking out specific projections by platform. But overall, Mike, we did highlight the 1% contribution to growth we expect to get from instrument revenues next year at CAG instrument revenues. And that's a very healthy growth rate that would imply kind of 20% to 30% growth in instrument revenues, and that includes, obviously, benefits from the ProCyte One launch. So we're looking forward that to being a positive net contributor, and we think we've got that built in appropriately in our outlook.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much, guys.\nBrian McKeon: Thank you.\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we have Erin Wright. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. You had some great data, obviously, on the market trends in the U.S., but I'm curious what you're seeing in international markets at this point in terms of clinical visits, new patient -- or new pet ownership, overall veterinary demand trends. Are you seeing the same level of resiliency there? And is it consistent with what you're seeing in the U.S., or what are some of the key differences between the two markets? And how are the trends in the fourth quarter and what you're anticipating into 2021 on the international side? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, I'll comment.\nBrian McKeon: Go ahead, Jay. Sure.\nJay Mazelsky: I was going to comment -- I'll comment. I'll give you a general flavor for the international market, and then Brian, I'd ask you to provide some specifics around some of the financials. The international markets continue to be quite healthy. Even with the pullback related subsequent waves, we've seen just a modest pullback in terms of our ability to visit customers in person. But the overall markets and the overall human pet bond has -- we're seeing the same type of trends outside the U.S. as we are in the U.S. And on top of that, we continue to invest in international expansions. I mentioned three country markets that we're expanding in, and those are going extremely well. We think that there continues to be just a great opportunity to be able to tap into the expansions. The other thing that we see is the IDEXX 360 program is being nicely adopted by our European customers. So the majority of our instrument placements are now through IDEXX 360. That's also having a nice impact on our reference lab to services as part of the volume commitment aspect of that. So Brian, would you like to add any flavor to that?\nBrian McKeon: No, I think that captures it well. Erin, as you know, we don't have the same level of insight at the PIMS level to some of the more granular data, but I would -- we did try to point out that we had basically the same level of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, U.S. and internationally. Both overall regions were strong throughout the quarter. We had 20% CAG DX recurring revenue growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and higher in Latin America. And we are basically hearing the same trends and seeing the same trends in our business in terms of just vet clinics being very busy and just driven by underlying growth in utilization. So it's similar trends. I think the U.S. is particularly strong, and we have the benefit of more data and insight in the U.S., but I think it just reinforces the strong global momentum that we have in our business.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And then do you think that there's any level of pent-up demand in instrument placements more broadly? Are you anticipating stepped up instrument placements into 2021, or how should we be thinking about the trends on a quarterly basis as they potentially normalize throughout the year?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So we've grown Q4 placements over Q3, Q3 over Q2. The clinics, we did see some initial restrained access to the clinics early on in the pandemic, and they have these, along with social distancing policies in effect. We're still modestly impacted by that. The other thing to keep in mind is that the clinics themselves are really busy. There's just a lot of -- there's a lot of patient traffic through the clinics. So in those cases, they may not -- they may desire an instrument or a new suite, but don't want to take the time to have to interrupt practice and retrain. So, there's some headwinds connected with that. But overall, I think that our customers are responding very favorably to instruments that could help them with both capacity and productivity as well as practicing better medicine.\nBrian McKeon: Yes. And one factor I'd point to, I think, to reinforce Jay's point on just the clinics being busy and the demand being a driver for instruments that we feel good about going forward is just the second catalyst placements. If you see the high level of the second catalyst placements in U.S. and international markets, that's reflective of clinics trying to keep up with the higher levels of diagnostics utilization. So, I think that's a positive factor. And we're still working through some of the access headwinds, but I think the general trend has been positive for us.\nErin Wright: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we have Nathan Rich. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning Jay and Brian. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just to start on the CAG Dx guidance. Going back to -- I think it was the first question. And the spread that you expect this year kind of narrowing back to the 9% to 10% range from the 12% that you saw this year, how much of that reflects potential conservatism, I guess? Because it seems like a lot of the trends that you saw driving frequency and utilization of diagnostics should continue. So, are there any other factors that we should just kind of keep in mind as we think about that's right kind of going back towards the historical range?\nBrian McKeon: Nate, I think it's primarily just reflecting the lapping of the step-up in growth, particularly in the second half. If you look at the premium that we're trying to use, the shorthand ways of looking at it, but in the U.S., the premium of CAG Dx recurring growth to clinical visit growth, it was about 1,600 basis points in Q3. It was about 1,200 basis points in Q4. And so I think there -- some of that, I think the Q3 benefited from pent-up demand. And so I think we're seeing some normalization from that dynamic. And as we get into 2021, we expect -- we do have a very healthy clinical visit growth rate projected and continued strong growth, but I think just recognizing that we had some step-ups here in the demand that, I think, is driving us. The 900 to 1,000 premium, we think, is an excellent premium and I think would position us very well for strong growth moving forward. But those are some of the factors we built in.\nNathan Rich: Makes sense. And then just, Brian, quickly, if I could follow up on your comments on sort of the cadence of revenue growth in 2021. Understand it will probably be stronger in the first half than the second. I guess if we think about sort of the current trends continuing into the first quarter, it seems like the CAG Dx recurring growth should be in that 20% range. That would mean sort of the back half of the year is high single-digits to 10%. Is that roughly the right way to think about the cadence of growth between the first half and the second half of the year?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, without getting to specifics on projections, because we're not going to be doing quarterly projections, and there's going to be a lot of noise in the quarters, as you know, Nate, maybe we had the beginning of COVID in Q1 and more meaningful impacts in Q2, and so things like the rebound in Q3, so I think year-over-year, the quarters are going to be a little bumpy. But directionally, yes. I think we're expecting that higher level of growth in the first half. And given the year-over-year step-up in growth, more moderate growth rates in the second half is what's implied in our guidance range. And so we'll see how the world -- the markets play out. It's still a very dynamic environment, as you might imagine, to try to forecast them. There's a lot of unknowns here just with the -- how the pandemic plays out and how those factors evolve as, hopefully, people get back to work and lives get back to normal. But I think that directionally, that's how we're thinking about it.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: From Stifel, we have Jon Block. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe first one, Brian, just the CAG recurring acceleration, the acceleration of around 100 to 200 bps, I think it's 13.25 at the mid-point versus pre-COVID levels. Just running some high-level math, it seems like another $30 million to $40 million incremental high margin revenue. And so can you just talk about, as specific as you're willing to get, where you're allocating the incremental gross profit dollars? We talk a lot about the flow-through from the CAG recurring. And, obviously, we're seeing that as that some of these U.S. international investments. And if so, do you think it just puts you guys in a stronger position as we look out in subsequent years? And then I've got a follow-up.\nBrian McKeon: Well, just to start, to your last point, Jon, I think you've got high CAG recurring diagnostic revenue growth. That's a very good dynamic for our business from a profit point of view and a gross profit expansion point of view. And so that is, clearly, a key driver of our performance in recent years and particularly in 2020. Just in terms of dynamics going into 2021, we do anticipate some investments in areas like lab capacity. We're trying to keep up with the very strong growth that we've seen. I'd point out that 2020 was an unusual year in that we -- early on, when we really didn't know how this was going to play out, we erred on the side, I would say, of caution and just been very tight with our costs controls last year and wanted to ensure that we had a healthy business model and asked people to make sacrifices. There were a lot that went into that. And so we're trying to reflect that we've got year-over-year compares here to a year that we had a high level of cost control, and we're going to have some investments that are coming back across the business, and we expect to try to highlight there's going to be things like health care costs and perhaps travel costs and things like that, that come back later in the year and as well as just trying to reengage and investing in areas that we held the line on in 2020 and had very high growth. So we've noted things like international commercial expansion as an area that we want to lean in. We want to continue to support our R&D agenda. And so the number of areas that are all aligned with our organic growth strategy that we're intending to support it, and that's reflected in our intent to have moderate operating margin gains on top of very strong performance. So we're committed to building on the performance but recognizing that we have some pent-up demand here, if you will, for investments in the business.\nJon Block: Yeah. Okay, got it. Very helpful. And then second question, goes down the same road that I think maybe went down to Mike as well, but I'll ask it a little bit differently, I think certainly differently. So you're guiding to an acceleration in the CAG recurring at 13.25 mid-point, and you've been around 11% to 12%, but it seems that the acceleration per your commentary is a function of greater expectations around clinical visits versus your premium to the clinical, right? With your premium to the clinical, you expect around that 900 bp to 1,000 bp premium. And so can you talk to that dynamic, guys? I would just think at a high level, the premium would be more in your control with the increased commercial investments, the innovation driving utilizations versus that, and trying to sort of guesstimate how the underlying clinical visit shakes out. So, why one versus -- you might end up in the same place, but I'm just curious why the premium would be unchanged and you feel more comfortable with the sort of high levels of clinical visit growth.\nJon Block: Thanks guys.\nJay Mazelsky: So, let me try to frame this up, Jon. So, there's a number of different factors that I think are driving growth. First off, there's more pets. We've talked about that and the majority being puppies and kittens, and that clearly has an impact. It's hard to get your arms around exactly what that impact is, but we provided some guidance in the past. Then there's more clinical visits even beyond the new pets. And for these clinical visits, we know that there's more clinical visits that are being used to provide medical services that include both higher use and intensity of diagnostics. And I think to your point, that's the piece that we can control through innovation and our commercial strategies and customer-friendly marketing program. So, that's where our focus is on being able to really drive that awareness and education and adoption by the veterinary customer to deliver better medical care. And I think we've provided some ranges in terms of what that looks like. And it's a very healthy market backdrop, and that's where our focus is.\nBrian McKeon: I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our last question from JPMorgan, we have Chris Schott. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two fairly quick ones here. Just on that topic of new pet growth. I think you referred to about 10% in 2020. How are you envisioning 2021 playing out? Is this another year of very healthy pet growth, or do you expect as we kind of go through the year, the world starts to normalize a bit, that we may be moderate back down to that 3% or so rate that we've seen historically? And then my second one was just given all the favorable trends that played out in 2020, are you making changes about how you think about promotion and commercial approach to lock in these dynamics? So, I know you've got a lot of initiatives that you've talked about to continue to grow the business. But have you changed what you're emphasizing or how you're approaching the vet just given what we learned about the kind of pet owner and willingness to spend over the last year or so? Thanks so much.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So, just to answer, so that 10% was new pet clinical growth versus new total pet growth in the marketplace and we think that, that's a healthy dynamic because they initially come into the practice as puppies and kittens. They make their initial checkup, which includes diagnostic tests. And to speak to your second point, the two are really related. If we do our job well with Preventive Care programs and other programs that those puppies and kittens as they become dogs and cats, continue to get care on an annual basis or twice a year. So, we think it's a healthy dynamic and plays into our strengths, both as a commercial and marketing strategy. The programs we actually have in place are ideally suited to drive that. So, if you think about the Preventive Care program that we have 4,800-plus customers enroll in that, that's a great example of a driver of medical services and, in turn, diagnostics usage. So, our programs are geared towards driving education and adoption of both wellness and non-wellness type care and testing. So we think we're very aligned, and we think it's a trend that we can sustain, and that's the plan to be able to do that.\nJay Mazelsky: So I think that's the last question. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering today. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and to provide an overview of our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q4, supported by expanding global demand for companion animal health care. Revenue increased 19% as reported and 17% organically, driven by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth sustained at high levels across U.S. and international markets through the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong clinical visit growth trends and increased utilization of diagnostics. Flow-through operating margin benefits from high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported achievement of $2.01 in EPS, which included a $0.25 nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 in tax benefit from stock-based compensation activity. Strong CAG growth results and proactive cost controls supported delivery of outstanding full year 2020 financial performance, above our long-term goals. IDEXX achieved 12% full year organic revenue growth, driven by nearly 15% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 25.7%, an increase of 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The combination of high revenue growth and operating margin gains supported delivery of full year EPS of $6.71 per share, an increase of 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Robust CAG market trends position us for continued strong financial performance in 2021. Today, we're providing our initial outlook for full year revenue growth and key financial metrics and an expanded information table shown in our press release and snapshot. Highlights include an outlook for 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 12% to 14.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our financial outlook reflects a targeted 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable constant currency basis, building on strong 2020 performance. These gains are projected to support 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth, aligned with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2021 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and recent market trends. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 17% was driven by 21% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 22% gains in international markets. Strong overall organic growth was also supported by 13% organic gains in our LPD business and approximately $10 million or 1.5% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 test initiatives. Overall, organic growth was moderated by pandemic related pressures, which constrained water revenue growth and contributed to a 10% year-on-year decline in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the fourth quarter. CAG growth dynamics remain healthy across global markets with 20% or higher CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue gains achieved in the North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. For the full year 2020, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth increased an impressive 15% in both U.S. and international markets. High U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains continue to be aided by strong growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth reached 8% in Q4, up from 6% growth in Q3, reflecting sustained 10% growth in wellness visits and higher 10% growth in non-wellness visits. A factor continuing to support high clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added 1.5% to 2% to overall clinical visit growth and 2.5% to 3% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported a 12% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4, well ahead of an improved 4% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. These positive market dynamics and benefits from investments in IDEXX's commercial capability, wellness program initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care drove high Q4 and full year organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 19% organically in Q4 led by nearly 20% organic growth in the U.S. and mid to high teens organic growth in international markets. Reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories, including support from high levels of wellness testing in the U.S. and benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements in international markets. For the full year 2020, global lab revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting mid-teen organic gains in the U.S., and approximately 10% growth overall in international markets. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 25% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting high growth across U.S. and international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium installed base. These dynamics supported a 19% full-year growth in IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2020. While CAG instrument placements continue to be constrained by pandemic impacts restricted \u2013 restricting sales access to vet clinics, trends have improved solidly over the second half of 2020. In Q4, CAG instrument revenues were $3 million below strong prior year levels, representing a 10% year-over-year organic revenue decline. Overall global Catalyst placements in Q4 were 13% below strong prior year levels, which included high levels of international upgrades. While overall placement levels were constrained to a degree by the pandemic, the quality of CAG instrument placements remained high. Globally, placements at new and competitive accounts were down approximately 4% compared to strong prior year levels. These results reflected 414 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 1,092 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also placed 525 second Catalysts globally to support high-growth with our customers. New placements and continued high customer retention levels drove a 13% year-on-year increase in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 1,224 premium hematology placements in Q4, supporting a 10% year-on-year expansion in our premium hematology installed base. We also placed 671 SediVue analyzers, bringing our global SediVue installed base to nearly 10,700 instruments, up 20% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q4, driven by high-growth in the U.S., aligned with broader gains in demand for diagnostic testing, including robust gains in clinical wellness business. For the full year 2020, rapid assay organic revenue growth was 9%, reflecting strong volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. We're planning for similar levels of net price improvement in CAG recurring revenues in 2021. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 1% organically overall in the fourth quarter. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging system placement levels. For the full year 2020, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 3% organically, as strong gains in software services were offset by pandemic-related pressure on new imaging system placements. Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues posted modest organic growth in Q4, as solid gains in compliance testing were offset by pandemic-related pressure on non-compliance-related activity. These impacts contributed to a 2% organic decline in full year 2020 Water revenues. While recent trends in our Water business have improved relatively, we're planning for uneven demand in non-compliance testing in 2021, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 13% organically in Q4, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Better-than-expected LPD results reflected high demand for diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever and gains in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains offset lower herd health screening levels in export markets compared to strong prior year results. For the full year, LPD revenues increased 11% organically. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect to see constraints on LPD growth rates as we lap the benefits of the 2020 step-up in revenues from expanded African Swine Fever testing programs. Turning to the P&, operating profit results were very strong in Q4 reflecting flow-through from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. As a reminder, prior year operating profit results were impacted by $13 million in CEO transition charges. Normalizing for these impacts, operating profits increased 43% year-on-year in Q4 on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting 460 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement. Gross profit increased 24% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results reflected productivity gains in our lab operations supported by high organic lab revenue growth as well as favorable net mix impacts from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Operating expenses in Q4 increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the 2019 CEO transition charges. Relatively accelerated operating expense growth reflected higher incentive compensation and healthcare costs as well as increased investment in R&D and enhancement of our global CAG commercial capability. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong global growth momentum. For the full year 2020, operating margins reached 25.7%, up 270 basis points as reported and 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting high CAG Diagnostic revenue growth and benefit from cost controls. As highlighted in our initial guidance for 2021, we're targeting to build on this strong performance as we advance high return investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. The EPS in Q4 was $2.01 per share, including $0.25 per share in non-recurring tax benefit and $0.13 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2020, EPS was $6.71, up 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Full year EPS results also included $39 million or $0.45 per share and tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 590 basis points of effective tax rate benefit and $22 million or 330 basis points of effective tax rate benefit from the non-recurring tax item. In terms of other factors impacting our reported results, foreign exchange effects have turned favorable given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4, FX added nearly 2% to revenue growth and $1 million to operating profit net of Q4 hedge losses of approximately $2 million. For the full year 2020, foreign exchange rates decreased EPS by $0.06 per share, net of FX hedge gains of $1 million. Free cash flow was $541 million for 2020. Free cash flow conversion was 93% of net income or 97% adjusted for our investments at our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation, which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended 2020 with leverage ratios of 1.1 times gross and 0.64 times net of cash with $384 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but we have reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, reflecting confidence in our long-term growth strategy. Turning to our 2021 outlook. As noted, we've included a table in our press release and snapshot reflecting our initial outlook for revenue growth and other key financial metrics, recognizing that it remains a relatively dynamic environment in terms of financial forecasting. Our initial overall organic revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% is centered on an estimated organic growth range of 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As a benchmark, this recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021, building on strong 2020 momentum and a premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinical visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points, which is consistent with our strong growth trends heading into the pandemic. Our growth outlook range reflects our plans to drive continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth globally while also recognizing each year-on-year comparisons to very strong 2020 growth levels in the second half of the year. In terms of overall organic growth, we factored in an estimated 1% overall growth benefit from higher CAG Diagnostic capital instrument revenues, including net growth benefits from the ProCyte One launch this year. These positive impacts are expected to be moderated by tougher comparisons in our LPD business and continued COVID related growth pressures in certain areas such as water noncompliance testing demand. Please note that given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter with expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're targeting 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable constant currency operating margin improvement in 2021. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 27.3% to 27.8%. We're planning for continued solid momentum from gross margin gains with some moderation and benefits related to product mix impacts and increased lab staffing to support high-volume growth. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong growth trends. We also expect some relative year-on-year increases in costs in certain areas such as employee health care costs, claims and travel costs as pandemic related restrictions are eased. Our outlook incorporates projection for foreign exchange to be a net positive factor in 2021 at recent exchange rates. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate FX will provide a positive 1.5% to 2% revenue growth impact in 2021 and approximately $0.14 of EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. We've included an outlook for net interest expense that assumes maintenance of a relatively consistent net leverage ratio in 2021. Given reduced share repurchase activity in 2020; we're projecting more limited year-on-year EPS growth benefit from reductions in average shares outstanding. Our 2021 outlook includes an estimated $0.09 to $0.11 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity compared to a much higher than anticipated $0.45 per share benefit in 2020. Our 2021 estimates reflect known option expirations and any established 10b5-1 plans. In terms of managing our 2021 financial performance, our focus will be on delivering strong full year results, while advancing our long-term growth strategy prudently in a dynamic environment. Given the strong momentum in our CAG business, we're inclined to lean in towards high-return organic growth-oriented investments while delivering continued improvement in operating margins, aligned with our long-term goals. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Yeah. Mike, why don't I start off, and then I'm sure Jay can weigh in on the broader trends. I think we feel we've got a very healthy growth range, as you know, for the full year on the CAG DX recurring of a 12 to 14.5. And I think the higher end of the range on top of the growth rate we had this year, we think, is a very healthy outlook for our business. I think for \u2013 we do feel good about the momentum entering the first half. I think we'll have relatively stronger growth in the first half. And I think you're highlighting the key question, which is the comparison in the second half, there was a step-up in the growth rate and driven by a number of factors, more pets, more testing, some pent-up demand that they've carried over from the early COVID impact. So I think we're just recognizing that there will be some year-over-year compare dynamics that go on that we'll learn more about as we go into the year. But I think we're \u2013 we feel very good about the momentum in the business. It was an amazing 2020, amazing recovery for the industry. And I think the \u2013 our high growth outlook reflects that. Yes. We're not breaking out specific projections by platform. But overall, Mike, we did highlight the 1% contribution to growth we expect to get from instrument revenues next year at CAG instrument revenues. And that's a very healthy growth rate that would imply kind of 20% to 30% growth in instrument revenues, and that includes, obviously, benefits from the ProCyte One launch. So we're looking forward that to being a positive net contributor, and we think we've got that built in appropriately in our outlook. Thank you. Go ahead, Jay. Sure. No, I think that captures it well. Erin, as you know, we don't have the same level of insight at the PIMS level to some of the more granular data, but I would -- we did try to point out that we had basically the same level of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, U.S. and internationally. Both overall regions were strong throughout the quarter. We had 20% CAG DX recurring revenue growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and higher in Latin America. And we are basically hearing the same trends and seeing the same trends in our business in terms of just vet clinics being very busy and just driven by underlying growth in utilization. So it's similar trends. I think the U.S. is particularly strong, and we have the benefit of more data and insight in the U.S., but I think it just reinforces the strong global momentum that we have in our business. Yes. And one factor I'd point to, I think, to reinforce Jay's point on just the clinics being busy and the demand being a driver for instruments that we feel good about going forward is just the second catalyst placements. If you see the high level of the second catalyst placements in U.S. and international markets, that's reflective of clinics trying to keep up with the higher levels of diagnostics utilization. So, I think that's a positive factor. And we're still working through some of the access headwinds, but I think the general trend has been positive for us. Nate, I think it's primarily just reflecting the lapping of the step-up in growth, particularly in the second half. If you look at the premium that we're trying to use, the shorthand ways of looking at it, but in the U.S., the premium of CAG Dx recurring growth to clinical visit growth, it was about 1,600 basis points in Q3. It was about 1,200 basis points in Q4. And so I think there -- some of that, I think the Q3 benefited from pent-up demand. And so I think we're seeing some normalization from that dynamic. And as we get into 2021, we expect -- we do have a very healthy clinical visit growth rate projected and continued strong growth, but I think just recognizing that we had some step-ups here in the demand that, I think, is driving us. The 900 to 1,000 premium, we think, is an excellent premium and I think would position us very well for strong growth moving forward. But those are some of the factors we built in. Yes, without getting to specifics on projections, because we're not going to be doing quarterly projections, and there's going to be a lot of noise in the quarters, as you know, Nate, maybe we had the beginning of COVID in Q1 and more meaningful impacts in Q2, and so things like the rebound in Q3, so I think year-over-year, the quarters are going to be a little bumpy. But directionally, yes. I think we're expecting that higher level of growth in the first half. And given the year-over-year step-up in growth, more moderate growth rates in the second half is what's implied in our guidance range. And so we'll see how the world -- the markets play out. It's still a very dynamic environment, as you might imagine, to try to forecast them. There's a lot of unknowns here just with the -- how the pandemic plays out and how those factors evolve as, hopefully, people get back to work and lives get back to normal. But I think that directionally, that's how we're thinking about it. Well, just to start, to your last point, Jon, I think you've got high CAG recurring diagnostic revenue growth. That's a very good dynamic for our business from a profit point of view and a gross profit expansion point of view. And so that is, clearly, a key driver of our performance in recent years and particularly in 2020. Just in terms of dynamics going into 2021, we do anticipate some investments in areas like lab capacity. We're trying to keep up with the very strong growth that we've seen. I'd point out that 2020 was an unusual year in that we -- early on, when we really didn't know how this was going to play out, we erred on the side, I would say, of caution and just been very tight with our costs controls last year and wanted to ensure that we had a healthy business model and asked people to make sacrifices. There were a lot that went into that. And so we're trying to reflect that we've got year-over-year compares here to a year that we had a high level of cost control, and we're going to have some investments that are coming back across the business, and we expect to try to highlight there's going to be things like health care costs and perhaps travel costs and things like that, that come back later in the year and as well as just trying to reengage and investing in areas that we held the line on in 2020 and had very high growth. So we've noted things like international commercial expansion as an area that we want to lean in. We want to continue to support our R&D agenda. And so the number of areas that are all aligned with our organic growth strategy that we're intending to support it, and that's reflected in our intent to have moderate operating margin gains on top of very strong performance. So we're committed to building on the performance but recognizing that we have some pent-up demand here, if you will, for investments in the business. I think we have time for one more question."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2020, driven by exceptional CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Strong CAG market trends continued through Q4, enabling us to deliver outstanding full year performance with 12% overall organic growth, significant expansion of our operating margins, 31% EPS growth on a comparable constant currency basis and 55% return on invested capital. While managing through pandemic impacts, we deepened our connection with our customers, strengthened our global commercial capability and advanced key elements of our innovation agenda. These steps position us well to build on our business momentum in 2021. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our markets and some of the dynamics that are supporting the impressive growth rates we've achieved in our core business. I'll also provide an update on some of our key growth initiatives in areas of emphasis this year. Finally, I'll discuss how we plan to manage the business, aligned with our initial financial outlook in what remains a dynamic macro environment. Let's begin with an update on market trends. We continue to see strong growth trends in Companion Animal healthcare reflected in high-growth in same-store clinical visits in the U.S., higher growth in new patients and an accelerated expansion of care. We also saw sustained solid market recovery across international markets, despite pandemic impacts. As Brian noted, clinical visits were up 8% overall in the U.S. in Q4, led by wellness visit growth of 10% and strong non-wellness, same-store growth of 7%. For the full year, clinical visit growth was approximately 3%, consistent with the growth we have seen in recent years, though with wide variations by quarter due to pandemic effects. Solid U.S. market growth trends have continued into early 2021. Market feedback from veterinarians remains consistent. Clinics are very busy with sustained high levels of demand supported by higher growth in new patients. Our market data tracking in the U.S. indicates a 10% increase in new clinical patients in 2020 versus 2019 growth of 3%, which contributed an estimated 1.5% to 2% of incremental overall same-store clinical visit growth in Q4. There continues to be evidence reinforcing robust growth in the pet population. As an indicator, we've seen a 70% year-over-year growth in IDEXX progesterone test revenue in the second half of 2020 in the U.S., as well as a significant step-up in new clinical patients with first-time pet parents. New patient growth has been augmented by the accelerated expansion of care. Overall revenue generated during clinical visits grew 15% per practice in the U.S. in Q4, driving 12% total revenue growth per practice. Diagnostics revenue is growing even faster at approximately 17.5% per practice in Q4 in the U.S. supporting full year 2020 same-store diagnostics revenue per practice increase of 12%, reflecting a significant step-up in growth in the second half of the year. We saw a clear trend of veterinarians performing more diagnostics in 2020, with average diagnostics revenue per clinical visit with diagnostics up 5% for the year. There are a number of potential drivers for this, which we've noted in recent calls. Pet owners are spending more time with pets during the pandemic. They may be more attuned to their health conditions and care. Curbside checking procedures may also be helping, as pet owners pre-approve diagnostic test runs, as required prior to the visit, helping veterinarians and their staff to provide higher standards of care. And veterinarians continue to pivot the focus on delivering medical services as their core value proposition. We've leveraged the strong market backdrop into even faster growth for our business, enabled by our commercial capabilities, clinical innovations and customer-friendly marketing programs. For the full year in 2020, the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth premium compared to clinical visit growth expanded to approximately 1,200 basis points in the U.S., up from the 900 to 1,000 basis point range heading into the pandemic. This is a healthy backdrop for our business in 2021. We're planning to support high growth in our CAG business, recognizing there continues to be significant unknown dynamics in the marketplace and the economy as we advance to the next phase of pandemic management. We believe our initial revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic growth and 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, represents a reasonable planning range in this context. There is considerable momentum in the market to continue expanding utilization of pet healthcare, and our strategy is to work with our veterinary partners through an expanded commercial presence to raise the standard of care through adoption of our testing innovations. A great example of our innovation focus is ProCyte One, our next-generation hematology point-of-care instrument, which is now in its final stages before product launch. ProCyte One will support a global commercial strategy by unlocking broader opportunity and reach to the customer, especially internationally. Veterinarians want chemistry and hematology diagnostics together, and they are busier than ever, making diagnostic solutions delivered with a best-in-class experience, highly relevant. Field trial customers are thrilled with ProCyte One's streamlined functionality in a compact footprint. With IDEXX 360 access to in-house hematology is easy and affordable, and our paper run and auto replenishment consumables model makes inventory and cash flow management hassle-free. Customer experience trials are proceeding well, and we anticipate beginning analyzer shipments in North America late Q1, but maybe early Q2. As we complete customer experience trials. We will follow with an international rollout beginning of Q2. Our expectation is to build volume throughout 2021. Pre-sale efforts led by our commercial and marketing organizations are raising awareness of our new hematology analyzer, as well as an increased appreciation of our existing world class hematology portfolio. This is generating interest in in-clinic hematology solutions and driving strong hematology placements. Another key area of innovation leverage is urine analysis. Our commercial teams continue to raise awareness about our SediVue's enhanced capabilities. Now with advanced bacteria detection. Determining whether bacteria are present or not is often the most important part of sediment analysis. Bacterial UTIs are, for example, a common diagnosis that is painful for pets and could be stressful for pet owners. With SediVue's advanced bacteria detection kit, veterinarians have accessed the real-time bacteria detection of the practice, providing early visibility to the absence or presence of bacteria. Customers highly value diagnostic solution for help them practice better medicine. In this case, allowing them to make more informed decisions within the patient window. We also saw strong interest in our SediVue platform in international markets in 2020, driving a greater than 50% increase year-over-year in our installed base outside of North America. Innovations delivered through our technology for life strategy continued to drive greater adoption for our SediVue platform. Innovation can take many forms. And our digital cytology offering is an example of a new personalized service enabled through imaging technology and our global team of over 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We are pleased with the exceptional feedback and world-class customer satisfaction ratings, point-of-care digital cytology following its launch in Q1 of 2020. Customers are realizing efficiency and clinical benefits in the integrated 24/7/365 service by opening additional appointments in their schedules and enabling same-day treatment plans. Patient results are integrated with major practice management systems with VetConnect PLUS, as well as being available on any iPhone or Android mobile device with the VetConnect PLUS app. It's a great example of how we uniquely support in an integrated way customer clinical and workflow needs. Most of the point-of-care digital cytology placements have been part of a program and almost one-third were combined with premium IDEXX VetLab analyzers. Many placements were important factors in attracting new business for our reference labs. With some customers, we have seen instrument placements accelerate cytology utilization and support strong revenue growth in that category. We'll continue to watch these trends closely as placements expand and more practices fully adopt the instruments into their daily workflow. Now let's transition to an update on our commercial accomplishments and initiatives. Our outstanding results couldn't be accomplished without disciplined commercial execution, which we have highlighted in the past as an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy. We see high returns in investments that allow us to spend more time with customers in person or virtually. As we've noted on the last call, leveraging a long history of U.S. expansions, we have made excellent progress with efforts to significantly expand our commercial footprint in three international country markets. We are on track to complete the expansion and have all new talent hired, trained and onboarded in the first half of this year. We completed our latest U.S. sales force expansion about a year ago now, and the team has ramped productivity, building customer relationships and tenure against customer access pressured from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's performance was exceptional, and instrument placement levels continued to improve sequentially in Q4. They remain somewhat constrained due to the restricted access to clinics and veterinary practice priorities focused on supporting high patient demand. In North America, overall premium instrument placements reached prior year levels, and Catalyst placements were up 14% year-over-year in Q4, including strong second Catalyst placements. These results were achieved while access to practices in-person visits by our customer account managers sustained at Q3 levels or 50% of in-person visits. In international markets, we had high levels of new and competitive catalyst placements, almost reaching prior year levels and second catalyst placements more than doubled prior year levels despite a modest pullback in customer account manager in-person visits in Europe. IDEXX 360 continues to gain significant traction in major international markets, supporting customer acquisition and placements of full VetLab suites as well as increased reference lab usage to support customer volume commitments. While we expect that sales professionals access to veterinary clinics will likely continue to be challenged until social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are relaxed, we are very pleased with our high level of commercial execution. Our expanded global commercial resources positions us well to pursue the vast opportunities we see in international markets and advance initiatives like preventive care in the U.S. We continue to see tremendous customer interest in establishing and expanding preventive care as an important category of pet healthcare practice. The IDEXX Preventive Care program has never been more timely as practices implement a customer-centric Preventive Care program to support the high levels of wellness visit growth and the growth of puppies and kittens we see in the market. Veterinarians view preventive care as a means to both deliver better pet health care and build healthy relationships with new and existing pet owners. Program enrollments in Q4 were approximately 300 newly enrolled customers, more in line with pre-COVID run rates, bringing our total enrolled practice levels to now over 4,800. Our software portfolio also had an exceptional year with a record-breaking number of PIMS placements globally, and over 20% growth in North America for the full year. The expansion of our PIMS installed base and cloud-based subscription customers supported strong double-digit growth in our software and services recurring revenues. Our cloud-based solutions, in general, continue to enjoy excellent momentum. For example, we now have over 5,300 customers utilizing our IDEXX Web PACS offering, an 18% increase year-over-year. We continue to center our software strategy on our customer workflow and clinical needs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the need for cloud-based mobile-centric solutions that deliver deep data insights and tools to further elevate patient care and enable practice efficiency. Investing in high-quality workflow solutions will continue to be an area of focus for us. Next, I'd like to highlight the remarkable operational accomplishments of our supply chain and reference lab teams, supporting our customers in an uninterrupted fashion, while keeping up with 20%-plus organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. Take our reference lab business, for example. Throughout 2020, not only has the team focused on keeping approximately 2,800 on-site reference lab employees at 80 global lab sites safe but did this while sharing continuity and a positive customer experience in an operating environment where transportation and logistics networks were at times highly challenged. And they didn't miss a beat opening our new Court Westland facility. It has been open since May and is operating exceptionally well. Notably, it is achieving record number of lab assessments for our European business. Before I conclude today's remarks, I want to highlight our efforts to make positive and lasting impacts on the communities we serve. As we announced on the last call, we recently established the IDEXX Foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund to support activities aligned with our purpose. Our mission is to create positive lasting impact for people, animals and the environment through inclusive and outcomes-focused initiatives. An area of focus that support the advancement of diversity in the veterinary profession by providing access to learning opportunities, I'm proud to share our inaugural, multiyear engagement with Tuskegee College of Veterinary Medicine, which has been recognized as the most diverse veterinary medical school in the U.S. and has educated more than 70% of the nation's African-American veterinarians. The IDEXX Tuskegee Scholars' Fund will support nine fully funded scholarships, as well as wellbeing and mental health support programs for veterinary students. We are excited about this important initiative in support of our purpose and mission. Before we turn to Q&A, I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our employees for a superb year in pursuit of our purpose. 2020 was a year like we've never experienced, a disruptive year that challenged all levels of the organization. We maintained the operating rhythm in the business, while responding with agility as circumstances required. The team's resilience is a testament to the purpose-driven and innovative culture at IDEXX. The organization stayed focused on serving our customers in an exceptional way while achieving a new high for employee engagement. I couldn't be prouder and more grateful for the teamwork, collaboration and professionalism that resulted in record performance in the face of unknowable challenges. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Yes. So I would just add to that. The logic of our guidance is linked to the market data. So we are optimistic about the outlook that the benefits will sustain. And I think Brian aptly painted the parameters of that. What we're seeing is we're seeing more pets in the marketplace. We're seeing those are driving more clinical visits, including first-time clinical visits with first-time pet parents. And veterinarians are providing more medical services beyond just the first time clinical visits. And medical services are enabled by diagnostics. You have to first diagnose before you treat. So it's a \u2013 I think it's a very healthy backdrop. And as Brian said, it is still a dynamic environment, and we'll see how it plays out. Sure, I'll describe the customer experience trials, and then I'll hand it off to Brian to talk about the impact in terms of how we factored it into the forecast. The customer experience trials have done extremely well. I think customers are thrilled with not just the compact footprint but the usability and the very ease of the use of the analyzer. From that standpoint it varies the breakthrough because hematology is a complicated diagnostic testing category. And by the way, the \u2013 these customer experience trials, it's something that is best-in-class in terms of the approach that we take. You can develop an amazing analyzer but you have to put it out in real environments and environments that our customers use to get the type of feedback. We're also \u2013 the other thing that it's driving is just an increased focus on hematology, in the importance of hematology. We know many of our markets are hematology-first markets and \u2013 meaning that they place relative priority on hematology testing even before chemistry. So we're optimistic. We think it's going to be a winner for us. We think that there are over or approximately 100,000 placement opportunities on a global basis. So we're very excited about it. And Brian, why don't you describe how we factored it into our forecast? Yeah, I'll comment. I was going to comment -- I'll comment. I'll give you a general flavor for the international market, and then Brian, I'd ask you to provide some specifics around some of the financials. The international markets continue to be quite healthy. Even with the pullback related subsequent waves, we've seen just a modest pullback in terms of our ability to visit customers in person. But the overall markets and the overall human pet bond has -- we're seeing the same type of trends outside the U.S. as we are in the U.S. And on top of that, we continue to invest in international expansions. I mentioned three country markets that we're expanding in, and those are going extremely well. We think that there continues to be just a great opportunity to be able to tap into the expansions. The other thing that we see is the IDEXX 360 program is being nicely adopted by our European customers. So the majority of our instrument placements are now through IDEXX 360. That's also having a nice impact on our reference lab to services as part of the volume commitment aspect of that. So Brian, would you like to add any flavor to that? Yeah. So we've grown Q4 placements over Q3, Q3 over Q2. The clinics, we did see some initial restrained access to the clinics early on in the pandemic, and they have these, along with social distancing policies in effect. We're still modestly impacted by that. The other thing to keep in mind is that the clinics themselves are really busy. There's just a lot of -- there's a lot of patient traffic through the clinics. So in those cases, they may not -- they may desire an instrument or a new suite, but don't want to take the time to have to interrupt practice and retrain. So, there's some headwinds connected with that. But overall, I think that our customers are responding very favorably to instruments that could help them with both capacity and productivity as well as practicing better medicine. So, let me try to frame this up, Jon. So, there's a number of different factors that I think are driving growth. First off, there's more pets. We've talked about that and the majority being puppies and kittens, and that clearly has an impact. It's hard to get your arms around exactly what that impact is, but we provided some guidance in the past. Then there's more clinical visits even beyond the new pets. And for these clinical visits, we know that there's more clinical visits that are being used to provide medical services that include both higher use and intensity of diagnostics. And I think to your point, that's the piece that we can control through innovation and our commercial strategies and customer-friendly marketing program. So, that's where our focus is on being able to really drive that awareness and education and adoption by the veterinary customer to deliver better medical care. And I think we've provided some ranges in terms of what that looks like. And it's a very healthy market backdrop, and that's where our focus is. Yes. So, just to answer, so that 10% was new pet clinical growth versus new total pet growth in the marketplace and we think that, that's a healthy dynamic because they initially come into the practice as puppies and kittens. They make their initial checkup, which includes diagnostic tests. And to speak to your second point, the two are really related. If we do our job well with Preventive Care programs and other programs that those puppies and kittens as they become dogs and cats, continue to get care on an annual basis or twice a year. So, we think it's a healthy dynamic and plays into our strengths, both as a commercial and marketing strategy. The programs we actually have in place are ideally suited to drive that. So, if you think about the Preventive Care program that we have 4,800-plus customers enroll in that, that's a great example of a driver of medical services and, in turn, diagnostics usage. So, our programs are geared towards driving education and adoption of both wellness and non-wellness type care and testing. So we think we're very aligned, and we think it's a trend that we can sustain, and that's the plan to be able to do that. So I think that's the last question. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering today. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, reflecting continued strong gains in our CAG business globally. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 19% as reported and 18% organically, supported by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was high throughout Q3, building on the strong global trends we saw in our CAG business in Q2. For Q3 year to date, CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth increased 12.8%, reflecting the extraordinary global resilience of demand for companion animal health care. Flow-through benefits from high recurring revenue growth drove a 470 basis point improvement in comparable constant currency operating margins in the quarter, enabling delivery of $1.69 in earnings per share, an increase of 47% on a comparable constant currency basis. In Q3 we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Our comparable constant currency operating margin improvement metrics and comparable constant currency EPS growth rates exclude impacts from this charge. For Q3 year-to-date, we delivered EPS of $4.70, up 28% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to be encouraged by robust CAG market trends, and we\u2019re planning for strong revenue growth and profit growth in our business moving forward aligned with our long-term goals. However, giving ongoing potential dynamics and uncertainty related to the pandemic, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 and 2021 at this time. As we\u2019ve done in recent quarters, we\u2019ll focus our review on the trends we\u2019re seeing in our markets and how we intend to manage our business effectively in this context. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our third quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 18% was driven by 21% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting 22% organic growth in the U.S. and 19% organic growth in international markets. Strong organic growth was also supported by 18% gains in our LPE business, driven by continued strong growth in Asian markets, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. Overall gains were moderated by constraints on new IDEXX VetLab and diagnostic imaging instrument placements and moderate organic declines in water revenues, though trends on these fronts improved solidly compared to the second quarter. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the third quarter reflected in approximately 24% organic growth in July, and growth of approximately 20% combined in August and September. CAG growth dynamics remained healthy across regions in Q3, led by very strong gains in the U.S., and high organic growth in other key markets such as Canada and Australia, aided by fulfillment of pent-up wellness demand. Revenue growth in Europe and other key Asia markets was also strong in the quarter, reinforcing the broad global recovery in our CAG business. For the year-to-date, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth has increased 13% in the U.S. and 12% overall in international markets. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains continued to be aided by solid growth in clinical visits, as demonstrated in our same-store U.S. weekly tracking data published in our earnings snapshot, available on our website. Overall clinical growth sustained at 6% in Q3, supported by continued solid 3% growth in non-wellness visits and 11% growth in wellness visits including benefit from pent-up demand, which we estimate contributed 2% to 3% to overall clinical visit gains in the quarter. As Jay will discuss, a factor supporting clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added approximately 1% to overall clinical visit growth and 2% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. A continued focus on health care services supported an 11% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenue in Q3, well ahead of 1% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. IDEXX growth has been even stronger than these positive market trends, particularly in our U.S. core market where Q3 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains exceeded 20%. A key metric we follow for the U.S. market is the premium of CAG recurring revenue growth to overall clinical visit growth. In recent years, this metric has increased steadily from a 7.5% growth premium in 2016 to a 9% premium in 2019, reflecting enhanced commercial capability, program initiatives and technology we\u2019ve been advancing to support the development of diagnostic testing. In 2020, we\u2019ve seen an acceleration of this trend. Year-to-date, the CAG Diagnostic growth premium to clinical visits has expanded to 12%, supported by a further acceleration in growth in Q3. These trends reflect an increased focus on services overall at the clinic level, which help drive growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to 6% for year-to-date compared to approximately 4% growth in recent years. These are encouraging trends that we\u2019re monitoring closely and Jay will discuss in more detail, which point to a strong ongoing market growth dynamic for our CAG business. This positive market backdrop supported high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 24% organically in Q3, led by more than 20% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen organic gains in international markets. Relatively higher U.S. gains are aligned with higher levels of wellness testing which has benefited recently from fulfillment of pent-up testing demand. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 22% on an organic basis, reflecting similar high levels of strong growth in U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization across regions, improved very high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium install base. CAG instrument replacements recovered solidly in Q3, as sales access to veterinary clinics gradually increased and clinics look ahead to supporting strong growth in diagnostic testing. While improving from recent trends overall replacements continue to be constrained by a degree by restricted sales access to some clinics, as well as near-term clinic work focus on supporting high demand for their services. These factors contributed to a $3 million or 10% year-on-year decline in reported CAG instrument revenue for the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high, reflected in 303 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 860 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 372 second-catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 15% year-on-year growth on our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 978 premium hematology replacements and 495 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 10,000 instruments, up 22% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q3, driven by high growth in the U.S., supported by pent up demand for wellness testing. Q3 year to date rapid assay organic revenue growth was 6%, driven by continued solid volume gains for 4Dx and specialty testing. Overall CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3% growth. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 4% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and strong increases in new software system placements supported by the fulfillment of outstanding backlog orders were moderate by lower diagnostic imaging system placements compared to strong prior year levels. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues declined 4% organically in Q3, impacted by pressures on noncompliance-related testing which represents about 20% of water revenues. As noted in our Q2 earnings call, the vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service. We expect uneven demand related to noncompliance testing to persist, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 18% organically in Q3, driven by strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. LPD results continued to benefit from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We\u2019re also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see moderation in our LP growth rate moving forward as we begin to lap the benefits of our prior year expansion of our African swine fever testing programs. Turning to the P&L. Profit results were very strong in Q3, benefiting from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and favorable product mix as well as continued benefits from proactive cost management. These actions supported a 70 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 470 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 23% on a reported basis and 43% on a comparable constant currency basis. As noted earlier, we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share charge related to an ongoing litigation matter which was recorded in G&A and is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. EPS was $1.69 per share, including benefits of $16 million or $0.18 per share related to share-based compensation activity, bringing year to date share compensation related benefits to a much higher than expected $27 million or $0.31 per share. As noted on a comparable constant currency basis, Q3 EPS increased 47%, adjusting for these benefits and the impact of the litigation. Gross profit increased 23% in Q3. Gross margins increased approximately 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by over 20% organic revenue growth as well as favorable net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Foreign exchange hedge impacts, which are recorded in gross profit reflected a $1 million loss in Q3 and $3 million of gains year-to-date. Recent FX rates would indicate a modest favorable year on year revenue growth rate impact for Q4 and 2021, with profit benefits mitigated by previously established hedged positions. Operating expenses in Q3 increased 22% on a reported base and 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the litigation accrual. Q3 operating expenses included a $10 million investment related to the funding of the newly established donor-advised fund, the IDEXX Foundation, which Jay will discuss in his comments. As noted in our last call, aligned with the strong recovery in global CAG demand, we\u2019re advancing targeted new hiring and prioritized investments in support of our long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability. We also expect incremental R&D costs in Q4, as we advance final steps ahead of the ProCyte One launch and expect employee health care and dental cost claims to increase as individuals seek previously deferred health care. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of Op Ex growth moving forward as we support our solid growth trends. In terms of cash flow, we generated $336 million in positive free cash flow year to date. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 90% or 96% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, aided by the exceptional financial performance we saw in Q3, and the steps we took to enhance our liquidity and flexibility earlier in the year. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.2 times gross and 1 times net of cash, with $176 million in cash and no borrowing on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter. Given our strong business results and positive cash generation and our confidence in the strength of the CAG market recovery, we will be looking at reinitiating share repurchases in the future, aligned with maintaining a prudent capital structure. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong momentum and high level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q3. IDEXX continues to show that we have a great business model and an amazing market with tremendous resilience and long-term growth potential. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered exceptional performance in Q3, driven by sustained strong underlying market trends in our global CAG business. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were supported in part by pent up demand for health care services, as well as a continued overall shift towards a provision of more veterinary services. These services are often enabled by a higher use and intensity of diagnostics. Delivering excellent patient care is the key value proposition of veterinarians and to treat, they must first diagnosis. Proprietary IDEXX diagnostics place an important role in this paradigm. We\u2019ve continued to see a clear, V-shape recovery in Companion Animal health care and these trends point toward a potential sustained level of accelerated growth for diagnostics testing. Let me start with a brief update on our market trends, including observations on how our customers are adapting and review the exceptional execution of our commercial organization in engaging and supporting tell them. As Brian noted, we\u2019ve seen solid growth in same-store clinical visits in key markets like the U.S. as well as sustained, strong recovery in clinic demand across our international markets. The factors supporting these results has been pent up demand for pet health care, evidenced by 11% growth in wellness visits in Q3. We\u2019ve begun to see some moderation in these very high growth levels, while non-wellness visits, which we estimate account for approximately 60% of overall clinical visits and approximately 70% or more of related diagnostic revenues, continue to expand at a healthy 3% rate. Many pet owners, just like a significant number of IDEXX employees, continue to work from home and are spending significantly more time with their pets; were likely more attuned to their well-being, resulting in higher practice visits. These trends further reinforce the strong global recovery and health of our markets. As we work through the market recovery, additional factors are emerging, which have supported very high growth levels in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary clinics appear to be increasing their standard of care at an accelerated pace. Evidence of this can be seen in the average percentage of U.S. clinical visits that use diagnostics. This averaged approximately 45% in Q3 of 2019. While in Q3 of 2020, this metric was approximately 200 basis points higher. To put this higher step up in context, an average 50 basis point per year increase was more typical in recent years. Not only do more visits include diagnostics, but the intensity is measured by revenue, has also increased. Growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to the U.S. has increased to approximately 6% year to date compared to 4% growth in recent years. Pandemic workflow procedures like curbside drop-off and the desire to take more a comprehensive health care approach may be supporting these promising trends. Diagnostic revenue growth per practice continues to expand as a result of these factors. U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics revenue growth per practice increased 10.5% in 2020 compared to approximately 7.5% over the last five years. This is despite slowing of clinical visits due to the pandemic to 1% year to date compared to a five-year average of 3%. Our expanded commercial presence and focus on supporting the vet practice with innovative technology and insight for practice development continues to drive these favorable dynamics at a steadily improving rate. While we may see some moderation in these trends moving forward, these healthy dynamics reinforce a potential long-term positive backdrop for Diagnostic\u2019s market growth. Increases in the use of diagnostic speak to the willingness of pet owners to prioritize care for the health and well-being of their family members even during times of economic uncertainty. It also reinforces the increasing role of services in the vet clinic business model, reflected in an accelerated shift in diagnostics as a percentage of practice revenues. U.S. Diagnostic revenues as a percentage of total practice revenue reached 16.3% in Q3, approximately 100 basis points above prior year levels and compared to an average 25 basis point increase in recent years. For vet clinics, diagnostic services are one of the most profitable areas in the practice, and these trends can help mitigate the impacts of accelerated migration of product sales to online channels. An additional emerging factor that appears to be supporting higher service and diagnostics growth is an increase in first-time clinical patients. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve all seen and heard about increased interest in adopting puppies and kittens during the pandemic. While this is a difficult area to measure, we are seeing a meaningful increase in first-time clinical visits in our market tracking data. Year-on-year growth in first-time clinical visits measured to our U.S. practice intelligence database has increased an average of 8% year to date with accelerated growth since April, compared to approximately 2% year-on-year growth in recent years. As Brian noted, we estimate that incremental new-patient growth added approximately 1% to clinical-visit growth in Q3 overall. In our own business, we\u2019ve seen a meaningful step up in the number of U.S. hospitals running progesterone tests in average run levels, reinforcing a potential increase in breeding activity. While it\u2019s early to project the potential impact from these trends, evidence is emerging that there is an accelerated increase in growth in the U.S. pet population. While we recognize the potential for future business disruption related to the pandemic, these very encouraging trends are reinforcing our confidence in the long-term potential for our CAG business. Our Commercial organization is at the center of enabling this market development. So next, I will highlight key developments in our Commercial agenda. Our Commercial execution in Q3 was excellent. We saw solid continued recovery in instrument placements in North America and in international regions with 3,173 premium instrument placements globally in the quarter, including 1,700 Catalyst placements, with close to 70% in new and competitive accounts. Access to practices continued to improve through Q3, with in-person visits by our customer-account managers now at approximately 50% in-person in the U.S., and approximately 60% in Q3 on average in Europe. While underlying market demand for diagnostics has remained strong, we expect that sales professionals\u2019 access to veterinary clinics will likely continued to be pressured as social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 remain dynamic and continue to impact veterinary care. As highlighted during Investor Day, a key multiyear strategy is to scale our commercial footprint on a rolling basis in targeted international markets. These expansion efforts reflect a tremendous opportunity as two-thirds of the potential total addressable market over time will be outside the U.S. Leveraging the commercial playbook of best practices, we develop through multiple expansions in the U.S., our international expansion roadmap is tracking to plan. In Q3, we successfully launched programmatic efforts to essentially double our commercial footprint in two important European markets over the coming months. We expect to continue to make great progress on these initiatives through the remainder of the year, with all talent hired, trained and on-boarded by first-half of 2021. These efforts complement the strong commercial momentum resulting from investments made over the past several years in Europe. For example, our newly opened and now our largest reference lab in the world in Kornwestheim, Germany, is fully functional and providing differentiated menu and excellent service levels across Europe. Additionally, Hematology is a very important modality internationally. And the announcement of ProCyte One has been enthusiastically received by customers. Finally, customers across Europe have embraced our IDEXX 360 program which was configured to the unique needs of key markets in the region with over 50% of premium instruments placed in the quarter using IDEXX 360, a new high. The combination of innovations like ProCyte One, Kornwestheim and IDEXX 360, coupled with an expanded commercial footprint in select countries are key elements of our growth strategy. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care Program is key focus for our commercial and corporate accounts team in the second half of the year. Program results recovered in Q3 with strong adoption of the IDEXX Preventative Care Program with approximately 230 new enrollees in the quarter supported by sustained high wellness visits traffic. This brings our total enrolled practice level to over 4,500. Enrollments in the program approached pre-COVID levels in the latter part of the quarter, which is evidence that customers continue to embrace the IDEXX preventative care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to recover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics Another prioritized area of ongoing focus is supporting customers with integrated solutions that support practice productivity, and best medicine. A great example of this is our new hematology analyzer, ProCyte One, recently launched for pre-sale. Both our commercials teams, which were trained last month, and customers are very excited by the performance, usability, and cost profile of the analyzer. We are making solid progress with field trials with approximately 20 units at customer sites and more to follow over the next month. Customer use feedback in a live environment is part of our time-tested approach to ensure that we only ship when the solution is ready to support patient care in the most demanding and varied practice environments. We plan to begin shipping in Q1 with a gradual build in placements over the balance of the year. Expanding our premium installed base is a long-term objective for IDEXX with approximately 200,000 opportunities for placements globally including almost 100,000 hematology placements encompassing competitive, greenfield and upgrades for current customers with legacy analyzers. ProCyte One enables us to access a much broader part of the marketplace as it it\u2019s packed with the latest technology and simplicity, facilitating efficiency of the practice and trusted reference lab quality results. It also has affordable economics, including paper run billing and an inventory replenishment. From a clinical perspective, chemistry and hematology complement each other to provide a four-clinic clinical patient profile. Coupled with our Catalyst One chemistry platform with a growing menu of eight new tests in eight years, ProCyte One is yet another proof point of our commitment to brave comprehensive reference lab quality blood analysis to the point of care, the solutions that are both suited to small and large practices globally. And with our comprehensive program, IDEXX 360, we make access to advanced diagnostics easy and hassle-free for customers, with no up-front equipment costs. We have over the last year expanded IDEXX 360 to offer programs with flexible, early year commitments for new practice formations. This has been extremely well-received by these practices and enables us to grow with them from their earliest days. We also continue to see positive customer experience and adoption of our innovations and product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. A great case in point is our digital cytology service offering. Our first customer satisfaction survey scores were best in class. Customers are delighted with the under two hours, 24 by 7 results promise we consistently deliver on. Moreover, we make reference lab services ordering and results viewing easy and convenient for our customers with our VetConnect PLUS diagnostic results portal. And more recently with IDEXX reference lab data and IVLS. IVLS was formerly used by customers jus with our point of care in clinic suite, but now approximately 2,700 customers are already taking advantage of this new IVLS functionality for reference lab results, too. As noted on our last earnings call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April and over half our North American customers have used the advanced bacteria kit to date. Detecting bacteria and urine is a key driver of clinical value, and we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive even greater appreciation of our SediVue platform. Our IDEXX urinalysis anywhere strategy further differentiates us by offering customer solutions that are unique, providing common flexibility to test at the practice or our lab, with seamless order integration and unified pricing. Our customers value our holistic customer-centric approach like urinalysis anywhere, and we see that appreciation reflected in very high customer retention rates. Moving on to our veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging businesses. We saw strong new software system placements in Q3, supported by the hard work of our commercial organization and the healthy pipeline they built earlier in the year, with 35% growth year-over-year in new PIMS placements globally, including on premise and cloud systems. Although diagnostic imaging new systems placements decreased year-over-year, as access to veterinary practices was pressured by COVID-19, our customers are excited about the ImageVue DR30, our new digital imaging system we announced in August. The DR30, along with our other imaging products offers the most advanced digital imaging technology in a market, with software capabilities that provides streamlined workflow and efficiency of the practice. The continued growth of our software and digital imaging systems install base and subscription customers for cloud solutions are driving strong, double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues. As we advance our commercial capabilities, we\u2019re also advancing our commitment to the positive impact we make in the communities we serve. Today I\u2019m excited to share that we have established an IDEXX foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund with a contribution of $10 million to support activities aligned with our purpose: to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. As part of IDEXX\u2019s overall corporate responsibility efforts, IDEXX has invested for decades in organizations and initiatives aligned with our purpose and guiding principles. The IDEXX foundation will complement our ongoing local partnerships while also broadening our geographic reach and social impact. The IDEXX foundation\u2019s priorities will be on long-term outcomes-focused investments in areas such as supporting education in the veterinary and stem fields, including diversity, equity and inclusion in animal health care. We\u2019re excited about this important step in support of our purpose and mission. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities also continues to be a top priority for us. The majority of IDEXX employees continue to work remotely and as travel remains limited, employees leverage virtual technology to stay connected and engaged from their home offices. Our on-site teams continue to execute at very high levels to support exceptional market demand, while maintaining important health and safety procedures. Overall, we\u2019re excited about the strong, continued market performance and resilience in animal health and more specifically, in our category. We\u2019re positioning ourselves to support continued strong growth, aligned with our long-term potential and financial goals. This means continued investment in innovative solutions that solve the most challenging problems faced by veterinarians. And the expanded commercial capability to bring the innovations to new and existing customers and markets. While the resilience of our industry and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular is extraordinary, the situation remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor closely the pandemic\u2019s impact on consumers and pet owners and react appropriately. Lastly, I would like to take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers for their resilience and perseverance during economic uncertainties and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. I\u2019m extremely proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together in the last two quarters and look forward to the journey still before us. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.\nRyan Daniels: And thanks for all the detailed information. I\u2019m curious if you could speak a little bit to the international growth outlook and your investments there. It\u2019s a somewhat interesting dichotomy because you\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in the industry in OUS, and sounds like you\u2019re making a significant expansion. But there is also an ongoing uptick in COVID cases and more lockdowns. So I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re balancing the growth in your field sales force in particular, contrasting that against what could be potential more market hiccups going forward. Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Ryan. I\u2019ll take that, and Brian may add some additional color. We see the international opportunity as very significant, about two-thirds of the potential addressable market. And we know our international customers, pet owners, love their pets as much as we do. So it\u2019s really a question of helping to develop the marketplace. We see a lot of parallels to what we\u2019ve done in the U.S. to market creation overseas. So that speaks to the investments we\u2019ve made in terms of field footprint which brings diagnostics subject-matter experts, a reference lab which builds out the lab network and provide the type of service levels our European customers in this case expect, a number of investments in information management solutions, as well as products like Catalyst One, and now ProCyte One that fit those markets really well from a footprint and price standpoint. So we saw very nice growth in international, 29% recurring revenue on an organic basis. We have seen some renewal second wave, third wave of cases in parts of the U.S., but also parts of Europe. We think our customers will work through that. We\u2019ll work through that with them. That can provide potentially some short-term headwinds. But overall, the investments are really pointed towards the long-term potential growth of the marketplace. Brian, did you want to add anything to that?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, no. I think that, I think, Ryan, is the key point as we\u2019re really encouraged by the resilience of the markets globally. I think it reinforces there is sustaining long-term growth potential and underlying health from the business. We do anticipate there could be some bumps in front of us just in terms of the management of the pandemic. But we\u2019re very focused on ensuring we continue to invest towards long-term market development, and that includes adding commercial resources that can support that. So we\u2019re trying to be balanced on that front. I think we\u2019re demonstrating that we can deliver good financial performance as we invest, and we\u2019re intending to lean into the positive growth trends that we\u2019ve been seeing, specifically since the second quarter.\nRyan Daniels: And then one more follow-up, I guess. You mentioned this I think, Jay, during your comments. We have seen some flow of product sales and pharmaceuticals to online and curbside pickup. And that could be a behavior change that sustains for a long period and drains some form of revenue from your client base. So I\u2019m curious if you view that as a big tailwind for Diagnostics, given that\u2019s something that is high profit that really can\u2019t leave the clinic. Are you hearing from your sales teams or from vets they\u2019re viewing this more as a kind of sustainable long-term revenue stream that they\u2019re going to focus on more going forward given potential structural changes? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Keep in mind, that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been going on for a while, the pivot to online sales, both pharmaceutical, probably more so on the specialty-diet front. If anything, COVID may have accelerated that. And we have seen veterinarians, even pre-COVID, talk about the fact that they are pivoting to focus more on delivering veterinary services. And to treat, you obviously have to diagnose, so we do think it\u2019s an area of the practice that\u2019s not tradable. It\u2019s not going to migrate outside the practice just by its very nature. So we do see that as a positive trend that it had already existed. And it may accelerate over time, but not necessarily unique to the COVID environment.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Kind of a follow-up to that, how you play into telemedicine and virtual care, but also on the preventative care side, can you give us an update on the traction there? And how you can rope that into kind of the telemedicine and virtual care landscape, and how you can really play into that trend because it\u2019s kind of counterintuitive how that impacts IDEXX?\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. In terms of the telemedicine, as part of revised workflows that practice has adopted early on, so this goes back to sort of the April/May time frame with patient curbside drop off and pickup and restricted access. A lot of practices look to telemedicine solutions. It\u2019s primarily more a software solution than something you would see on the human side with Teladoc. And our solutions integrate with the telemedicine offerings on the marketplace. And we have seen a lot of interest in it. Whether or not that sustains post-COVID remains to be seen. We think, ultimately, it\u2019s a positive for our business, especially if it brings like more cats into the practice and initial diagnoses of cats that may require a physical visit to the practice. In terms of preventive care, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw towards the tail end of the quarter more or less pre-COVID levels of enrollments. So we were 230 or so for the quarter which is slightly less than pre-COVID, but again there was movement towards the end of the quarter to more normal levels. And that\u2019s to be expected. These type of programs require a fair amount of in-clinic access from both an on-boarding and repeated training standpoint across the entire staff. But there is tremendous interest in the programs that piggyback on the tremendous interest in wellness in general. I think tying together your question and Ryan\u2019s question, it really does speak to the service orientation that we see amongst veterinarians, and obviously wellness and preventative care is a big piece of that.\nErin Wright: And on the capital equipment side, when will that come back? How much is it attributable to willingness to spend on capital equipment in this environment versus product cycle dynamics? And have you seen any aggressive promotional activity or changes in the competitive environment on that front? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, I\u2019ll provide a couple comments on that, and Brian may add some additional flavor. We did see a fairly dramatic recovery from Q2 levels. That capital equipment placement is both a function of clinic access \u2013 and that has remained somewhat restricted. We\u2019re at 50% in the U.S., 60% overall in-person visits internationally \u2013 but it\u2019s also a function, as Brian indicated in his remarks, of just the prefaces are busy. And if you think about placing an in-clinic suite that requires training and some workflow modifications, integration into their local network, they have to hit the pause button for some period of time in which to be able to do that. And when they\u2019re working pretty much the full days without a lot of gaps in their schedules that can be challenging in itself. But we do expect continued recovery throughout the year. It\u2019s really just a function of you know COVID-19 and the environment and its impact on practice access.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, I think what we\u2019ve learned to date through the pandemic, Erin, is that we don\u2019t see a caution for capital outlies as being something that\u2019s indicated by the sales force as being a challenge or changing competitive dynamics, anything like that. In fact, our retention levels are at record high levels. They actually improved. And we feel very positive about the dialogues we\u2019re having. I think, to Jay\u2019s point, it\u2019s more about access and just how busy the vets are. We would highlight that as you look at the case increases, the area that I think we anticipate relatively more impact is in things like instrument placements because that can be a prioritization of where vets are spending their time. The good news is the underlying demand in the market has consistently been so strong in this recovery that, that puts the industry in a good position what they can grow at a healthy rate. But we could see ongoing deferrals on this front if we\u2019re working through, again, kind of lockdown or enhanced social distancing procedures that add to some of the restrictions we\u2019ve seen. But good improvement, as Jay noted, from Q2 to Q3. Encouraging.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Jay, a quick one to start, just to follow-up on something that came up earlier. I just want to be clear. Have you seen any moderation whatsoever in some of the European markets like - specifically like France, Germany, UK, where we\u2019ve seen a little bit more of an uptick. I\u2019m just trying to delineate any trends you could be seeing in visits, the impact from on the one hand an increase in COVID cases and on the other hand an increase in government lockdown. I think what we\u2019ve seen previously is sort of that first wave and the key was it really was the lockdowns that drove it. And if we look at the U.S. data but by region it doesn\u2019t really seem like there is an impact so far, but I want to be clear if you\u2019ve noticed anything in some of the parts of the world where the second wave is a little bit more advanced.\nJay Mazelsky: Well. I will - oh, go ahead.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, Mike, maybe just this context. I know you\u2019ve seen the - just this context. The U.S. data, we do report on that. And that the visits were sustained kind of solidly into Q4 and the non-wellness is sustaining well so even with some of the moderation we would expect in the pent-up wellness demand that\u2019s held up well. Jay can talk to this, but I would say in international markets you don\u2019t have the same level of kind of wellness benefit, if you will, in terms of just how they provide care. And what we saw in markets in Europe and in Asia was very strong recovery, kind of some benefits from some pent-up demand and kind of gravitation more towards kind of pre-COVID type volume growth rates late in Q3. And so I think it\u2019s early to look at how new lockdowns might impact the business.  Clearly that had been a factor back in March and April. I think the markets have learned to adapt here to continue to provide services. As mentioned earlier I think we would anticipate this could cause some constraints on areas like instrument placements, and you know there is always a chance selectively this could impact some underlying demand or prioritization of services, but I think it\u2019s early for us to make any projections on that front.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, let me just build on a couple of those points. Our international markets are more biased towards in-clinic testing as well as non-wellness or sick patient testing, which is less impacted by COVID-related social distancing policies. So to Brian\u2019s point we believe we have seen a return to more or less pre-COVID levels internationally, but the mix and flavor is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. And with the non-wellness testing, the percentage of diagnostics usage is also higher. It\u2019s close to 80% or so from a split standpoint between non-wellness and wellness. So hopefully that gives you some flavor on potential impacts\nMichael Ryskin: And you\u2019re right, just now looking at the snapshot you guys posted on the website, kind of parse into it as much as you can. It does seem like the West region and the Midwest has held in really well. And that\u2019s where the second wave in the U.S. has been, so that does indicate that it\u2019s a little more stable. Quick follow up for me, Brian, for you on some of the spending and investments going forward. You touched on this earlier, obviously very strong free cash flow year-to-date. You talked about starting to ramp things up again. Could you go into a little bit more detail going forward beyond some of the international investments and the R&D you talked about in 4Q with ProCyte. What else are you targeting? How sustained is this going to be? Is this going to be some catch-up spend maybe you pulled back early in the year? Or is this going to be a new higher level that\u2019s more sustained going forward? And then also on the capital deployment front, if there\u2019s any changes there beyond your comments on the share buybacks?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, at a high level we\u2019re transitioning from a period early on where we tried to be really cautious on investments with a lot of unknowns in front of us with business growth. And like many companies, froze hiring and pulled back on compensation and tried to ensure we\u2019re in a good place. And we are now going through a period where we have a higher level of confidence on the underlying market growth. We are getting ready for 2021 and thinking about how we\u2019re going to manage our business going forward. And we\u2019re starting to advance new hiring and positions that we had frozen, and things we wanted to move forward with. We\u2019re adding staffing in our labs to try to keep up with 20%-plus volume growth. And I think this is more indicative of us having a higher level of confidence in the kind of the underlying market demand and how COVID may impact our business and ensuring we\u2019re prepared for that going forward. We are doing catch up on areas, I can tell you in central compensation accruals and things like that, that we were quite conservative earlier in the year and we\u2019re in a better place to support that now. And we reinstated salary reductions and reinstated 401(k) reductions and things like that. So there is some of that going on. But I think the bigger picture here is we\u2019re looking at a market and our business that\u2019s growing at very healthy rates, and we want to ensure that we\u2019re investing towards that and supporting that and have confidence that we can do that well while delivering financial performance that\u2019s aligned with our long-term goals.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJon Block: Thanks for the time, guys. Good Morning. Maybe first question we\u2019ll just start with ProCyte One and the year one, or essentially the 2021 contribution, and I don\u2019t expect details. But if you can help us think it through or conceptualize what that contribution might be. And I\u2019ll throw two things at you. I think SediVue was over 2,000 units-ish in the first 12 months. And if I look at your snapshot your hematology base is over 30,000. And so if you were to turn 10% of that base that\u2019s 3,000 units, is that a good ballpark to think about that this should somewhat replicate a SediVue type launch? Should it be greater because SediVue was arguably pioneering in urine sediment in clinic? Jay, maybe if you can just talk to that and the dynamics, that\u2019d be very helpful.\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. I think about ProCyte One more from the standpoint, just as a benchmark analog more from the standpoint that Catalyst One as a reasonable benchmark for pace of the placement belt. Keep in mind, Catalyst One had a longer presale period than ProCyte One, so you got to take that into consideration. To your point, it is - hematology is a more established marketplace. There\u2019s certainly, I think a lot of interest for it. But the way we\u2019re rolling it out is first in North America and then follow quickly thereafter internationally, where there\u2019s a really nice, I think two-thirds plus of the opportunity is there. So you would have to take that into consideration. The other thing is, ProCyte One will have a - we believe it\u2019ll have a very high attach rate with chemistry. So our focus is really on being able to place suites of chemistry, hematology and potentially, urinalysis versus just taking ProCyte One, and let\u2019s say upgrading a laser site account or just a single competitive hematology account. Brian, did you want to add anything to that?\nBrian McKeon: No. I think that\u2019s all the right kind of background. I think we - as Jay noted, we\u2019ll be rolling this out gradually through the year or - so some of this will depend on how the exact timing of how that phases. And I think the Catalyst One launch is a reasonable benchmark. But we\u2019ll provide more insight on that as we get closer to year-end call, we\u2019ll give some more indications of how we\u2019re feeling about that outlook.\nJon Block: And the second one I\u2019ll pivot - Brian, I\u2019m long overdue for a margin question so I\u2019ll throw one your way. But I know you\u2019re not guiding. But if we can just talk about margin expansion next year and just puts and takes. And where I\u2019m going with this is your 50 to 100 bp goal, I don\u2019t think you ever backed off that goal even in years when you significantly outperformed. And I just want to check in on how we should be thinking about this next year; in other words, in 2020, clearly margins are benefiting from some of the temporary salary reductions you had in place. They\u2019re benefiting notably from a mix shift perspective, right, as the equipment\u2019s been down and the recurring is just ripped. And so do you sort of stick to that 50 to 100 bp thought next year? Or as we get into 2021, do we have to normalize for some of the variables that I just threw out at you when we think about the rate of expansion into next year? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: We\u2019re shooting for the same long-term goals, Jon. So it\u2019s that 50 to 100 is \u2013 that\u2019s, we think a very reasonable estimate. We think we can deliver that in this kind of business. Clearly, you adjust for certain things like the litigation accrual things that are one-time in nature that we try to highlight, right. But you know, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance, but we have the same long-term goals. And as you know, when we\u2019re executing well in our growth and we have high CAG Diagnostic recurring growth, it puts us in a good position to deliver against the goals and support investment of the business. So more to follow on that but same goals for the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Jay, maybe to start, you highlighted a number of favorable trends kind of impacting the growth in the CAG diagnostics business. As we think about a little bit longer term about how that could kind of translate into what you guys see into 2021 and beyond, looking at the growth you saw this quarter, I think there were some factors like pent-up demand and growth from new patients that you guys quantified that maybe subside longer term. But it seems like the CAG diagnostics growth even excluding 3% to 4% from those maybe shorter-term dynamics would still have been in the mid to high teens. So I guess what I\u2019m asking is do you feel like based on the positive trends that you\u2019re seeing in the business that that type of CAG diagnostics recurring growth would be sustainable longer-term?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I\u2019ll give you just maybe some additional flavor on that. So just setting aside the pent-up demand piece because I think from a wellness standpoint I think a lot of that worked through in Q3. So the two or three maybe rather longer-term trends we\u2019re tracking from a sustainability standpoint is the new clinical patient visits, and we think that that is something that obviously if there is a lot of new puppies and kittens to the marketplace that they\u2019re going to need care, and that as they age. So that\u2019s certainly a positive. And we want to more data and see how that develops over time. And then I spoke to use and intensity of diagnostics, and that\u2019s tied up in this whole pivot to service, use in terms of more visits include diagnostics, and intensity when they use diagnostics it\u2019s at a higher average dollar volume. And some of that is in our control in terms of our commercial approach and innovations and being able to provide to veterinarians the tools that allow them to cover it more. So that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019ve invested in even pre-COVID, and I think we\u2019re seeing the fruits of it. And it may be on top of an accelerated pivot to services that we see on the part of veterinarians. So certainly, those are positives for the business. I think we just need more time to see how they play out and at what level.\nNathan Rich: And then if I could follow up on John\u2019s questions on margin, maybe looking at the CAG segment specifically. Gross margin was stronger than we had expected. I think the driver that you called out with reference lab productivity, obviously favorable mix, and then the price gains. Do you feel like that\u2019s sustainable over the next several quarters? And on reference labs specifically, you kind of mentioned adding staffing. Does that create any sort of maybe drag relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the past one or two quarters for the CAG segment?\nJay Mazelsky: Big driver in Q3 was lab productivity when we had 20-plus percent kind of growth and controls on costs. And we\u2019re not projecting sustained 24% kind of grow-through levels in the lab business. We\u2019re encouraged by the trends. So that is \u2013 we think that we\u2019ll continue to be able to get lab productivity, and we do need to add staffing. But that\u2019s more of a moderator than it is something that\u2019s a headwind if you will. So I think we do think we\u2019re in a good position to continue to get positive gross margin gains when you have high CAG recurring growth, and we\u2019re just highlighting that we\u2019re adding some investments back in the business, and trying to position ourselves going forward. So it\u2019s more of something that will moderate the gains. And just to reinforce, our goals are annually 50 to 100 bps of improvement, and we want to deliver good performance, but also ensure that we continue to invest towards long-term market development. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on as we\u2019re heading into next year.\nOperator: We have a question from David Westenberg from Guggenheim Securities.\nDavid Westenberg: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. So when we\u2019re looking at macro data I think we\u2019re seeing a gap over the last two quarters between practice revenue and practice volumes. I tend to think about maybe Diagnostics as being a benefit of volumes, and maybe the reason for the increase in revenue on a per-visit basis, or year-over-year basis. So am I thinking about that the right way that you actually would be on volume, and then you\u2019re actually just the cause of the practice increasing in revenue? And the reason why I kind of ask is if we look into next year and we think about how to model the company and how to \u2013 our expectation, should we be thinking about a factor \u2013 like this major factor above volume? Or should we be thinking about this as this lower factor above revenue in the practice growth?\nJay Mazelsky: Well, yes, so let me try to address that on a couple different levels. The practice revenue growth has been obviously very strong over the year. We saw 10.5%, 11% most recently. So that\u2019s \u2013 obviously, our Diagnostics growth has been faster than that, and we\u2019ve always believed that Diagnostics enables and drives services within the practice. And your question as the longer-term sustainability feeds into the discussion that we have previously around the pivot to services, veterinarians interested and obviously meeting demand for new clinical patient visits as well as being able to focus on what they do best, which is caring for patients. But I think is a positive backdrop for all the reasons cited, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out.\nBrian McKeon: Let me give you some metrics that maybe can help with this a little bit which is over the last five years, so if you break down the revenue per practice, Diagnostics revenue growth per practice growth that Jay referred in the call, it was about a 7.5% increase on average over the last five years. Roughly 3% of that was from visit growth. 0.5% contribution came from frequency, so that\u2019s the percentage of visits that include Diagnostics. And about 4% of that, which we mentioned was growth in Diagnostics revenue per visit. So year-to-date what we\u2019re seeing is 1% from clinical visit growth, a 3.5% contribution from frequency increases, and a 6% increase from revenue increases. And so we\u2019re learning about this. But to answer your question, it is both volume, which would be the frequency dynamic and the revenue piece, and that is the central question. Kind of like what\u2019s going on here? Is this sustainable? Do we see this expanding over time?  Clearly, the clinical visit dynamics we\u2019re coming to understand. In terms of it\u2019s healthy overall, and perhaps there\u2019s some benefit from new patients that can sustain. But I think this underlying trend of diagnostic frequency and utilization which has been a long-term trend for us, expanding it, the question is are some of the things going on through the pandemic, some of the learnings, the changing how service is being delivered, could that set the stage for some accelerated growth? So early to predict it. We\u2019re encouraged by it, and it\u2019s certainly consistent with what we\u2019ve been trying to do in the market. So it\u2019s something that we look to build upon.\nBrian McKeon: I think we\u2019re out of time, unfortunately, so we\u2019re going to\u2026\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, so want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call, and I want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these obviously challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering the day. And I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose which animates our work. And so with that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, reflecting continued strong gains in our CAG business globally. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 19% as reported and 18% organically, supported by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was high throughout Q3, building on the strong global trends we saw in our CAG business in Q2. For Q3 year to date, CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth increased 12.8%, reflecting the extraordinary global resilience of demand for companion animal health care. Flow-through benefits from high recurring revenue growth drove a 470 basis point improvement in comparable constant currency operating margins in the quarter, enabling delivery of $1.69 in earnings per share, an increase of 47% on a comparable constant currency basis. In Q3 we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Our comparable constant currency operating margin improvement metrics and comparable constant currency EPS growth rates exclude impacts from this charge. For Q3 year-to-date, we delivered EPS of $4.70, up 28% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to be encouraged by robust CAG market trends, and we're planning for strong revenue growth and profit growth in our business moving forward aligned with our long-term goals. However, giving ongoing potential dynamics and uncertainty related to the pandemic, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 and 2021 at this time. As we've done in recent quarters, we'll focus our review on the trends we're seeing in our markets and how we intend to manage our business effectively in this context. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 18% was driven by 21% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting 22% organic growth in the U.S. and 19% organic growth in international markets. Strong organic growth was also supported by 18% gains in our LPE business, driven by continued strong growth in Asian markets, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. Overall gains were moderated by constraints on new IDEXX VetLab and diagnostic imaging instrument placements and moderate organic declines in water revenues, though trends on these fronts improved solidly compared to the second quarter. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the third quarter reflected in approximately 24% organic growth in July, and growth of approximately 20% combined in August and September. CAG growth dynamics remained healthy across regions in Q3, led by very strong gains in the U.S., and high organic growth in other key markets such as Canada and Australia, aided by fulfillment of pent-up wellness demand. Revenue growth in Europe and other key Asia markets was also strong in the quarter, reinforcing the broad global recovery in our CAG business. For the year-to-date, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth has increased 13% in the U.S. and 12% overall in international markets. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains continued to be aided by solid growth in clinical visits, as demonstrated in our same-store U.S. weekly tracking data published in our earnings snapshot, available on our website. Overall clinical growth sustained at 6% in Q3, supported by continued solid 3% growth in non-wellness visits and 11% growth in wellness visits including benefit from pent-up demand, which we estimate contributed 2% to 3% to overall clinical visit gains in the quarter. As Jay will discuss, a factor supporting clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added approximately 1% to overall clinical visit growth and 2% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. A continued focus on health care services supported an 11% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenue in Q3, well ahead of 1% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. IDEXX growth has been even stronger than these positive market trends, particularly in our U.S. core market where Q3 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains exceeded 20%. A key metric we follow for the U.S. market is the premium of CAG recurring revenue growth to overall clinical visit growth. In recent years, this metric has increased steadily from a 7.5% growth premium in 2016 to a 9% premium in 2019, reflecting enhanced commercial capability, program initiatives and technology we've been advancing to support the development of diagnostic testing. In 2020, we've seen an acceleration of this trend. Year-to-date, the CAG Diagnostic growth premium to clinical visits has expanded to 12%, supported by a further acceleration in growth in Q3. These trends reflect an increased focus on services overall at the clinic level, which help drive growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to 6% for year-to-date compared to approximately 4% growth in recent years. These are encouraging trends that we're monitoring closely and Jay will discuss in more detail, which point to a strong ongoing market growth dynamic for our CAG business. This positive market backdrop supported high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 24% organically in Q3, led by more than 20% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen organic gains in international markets. Relatively higher U.S. gains are aligned with higher levels of wellness testing which has benefited recently from fulfillment of pent-up testing demand. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 22% on an organic basis, reflecting similar high levels of strong growth in U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization across regions, improved very high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium install base. CAG instrument replacements recovered solidly in Q3, as sales access to veterinary clinics gradually increased and clinics look ahead to supporting strong growth in diagnostic testing. While improving from recent trends overall replacements continue to be constrained by a degree by restricted sales access to some clinics, as well as near-term clinic work focus on supporting high demand for their services. These factors contributed to a $3 million or 10% year-on-year decline in reported CAG instrument revenue for the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high, reflected in 303 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 860 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 372 second-catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 15% year-on-year growth on our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 978 premium hematology replacements and 495 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 10,000 instruments, up 22% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q3, driven by high growth in the U.S., supported by pent up demand for wellness testing. Q3 year to date rapid assay organic revenue growth was 6%, driven by continued solid volume gains for 4Dx and specialty testing. Overall CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3% growth. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 4% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and strong increases in new software system placements supported by the fulfillment of outstanding backlog orders were moderate by lower diagnostic imaging system placements compared to strong prior year levels. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues declined 4% organically in Q3, impacted by pressures on noncompliance-related testing which represents about 20% of water revenues. As noted in our Q2 earnings call, the vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service. We expect uneven demand related to noncompliance testing to persist, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 18% organically in Q3, driven by strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. LPD results continued to benefit from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We're also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see moderation in our LP growth rate moving forward as we begin to lap the benefits of our prior year expansion of our African swine fever testing programs. Turning to the P&L. Profit results were very strong in Q3, benefiting from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and favorable product mix as well as continued benefits from proactive cost management. These actions supported a 70 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 470 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 23% on a reported basis and 43% on a comparable constant currency basis. As noted earlier, we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share charge related to an ongoing litigation matter which was recorded in G&A and is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. EPS was $1.69 per share, including benefits of $16 million or $0.18 per share related to share-based compensation activity, bringing year to date share compensation related benefits to a much higher than expected $27 million or $0.31 per share. As noted on a comparable constant currency basis, Q3 EPS increased 47%, adjusting for these benefits and the impact of the litigation. Gross profit increased 23% in Q3. Gross margins increased approximately 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by over 20% organic revenue growth as well as favorable net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Foreign exchange hedge impacts, which are recorded in gross profit reflected a $1 million loss in Q3 and $3 million of gains year-to-date. Recent FX rates would indicate a modest favorable year on year revenue growth rate impact for Q4 and 2021, with profit benefits mitigated by previously established hedged positions. Operating expenses in Q3 increased 22% on a reported base and 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the litigation accrual. Q3 operating expenses included a $10 million investment related to the funding of the newly established donor-advised fund, the IDEXX Foundation, which Jay will discuss in his comments. As noted in our last call, aligned with the strong recovery in global CAG demand, we're advancing targeted new hiring and prioritized investments in support of our long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability. We also expect incremental R&D costs in Q4, as we advance final steps ahead of the ProCyte One launch and expect employee health care and dental cost claims to increase as individuals seek previously deferred health care. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of Op Ex growth moving forward as we support our solid growth trends. In terms of cash flow, we generated $336 million in positive free cash flow year to date. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 90% or 96% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, aided by the exceptional financial performance we saw in Q3, and the steps we took to enhance our liquidity and flexibility earlier in the year. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.2 times gross and 1 times net of cash, with $176 million in cash and no borrowing on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter. Given our strong business results and positive cash generation and our confidence in the strength of the CAG market recovery, we will be looking at reinitiating share repurchases in the future, aligned with maintaining a prudent capital structure. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong momentum and high level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q3. IDEXX continues to show that we have a great business model and an amazing market with tremendous resilience and long-term growth potential. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Yes, no. I think that, I think, Ryan, is the key point as we're really encouraged by the resilience of the markets globally. I think it reinforces there is sustaining long-term growth potential and underlying health from the business. We do anticipate there could be some bumps in front of us just in terms of the management of the pandemic. But we're very focused on ensuring we continue to invest towards long-term market development, and that includes adding commercial resources that can support that. So we're trying to be balanced on that front. I think we're demonstrating that we can deliver good financial performance as we invest, and we're intending to lean into the positive growth trends that we've been seeing, specifically since the second quarter. Yes, I think what we've learned to date through the pandemic, Erin, is that we don't see a caution for capital outlies as being something that's indicated by the sales force as being a challenge or changing competitive dynamics, anything like that. In fact, our retention levels are at record high levels. They actually improved. And we feel very positive about the dialogues we're having. I think, to Jay's point, it's more about access and just how busy the vets are. We would highlight that as you look at the case increases, the area that I think we anticipate relatively more impact is in things like instrument placements because that can be a prioritization of where vets are spending their time. The good news is the underlying demand in the market has consistently been so strong in this recovery that, that puts the industry in a good position what they can grow at a healthy rate. But we could see ongoing deferrals on this front if we're working through, again, kind of lockdown or enhanced social distancing procedures that add to some of the restrictions we've seen. But good improvement, as Jay noted, from Q2 to Q3. Encouraging. Yes, Mike, maybe just this context. I know you've seen the - just this context. The U.S. data, we do report on that. And that the visits were sustained kind of solidly into Q4 and the non-wellness is sustaining well so even with some of the moderation we would expect in the pent-up wellness demand that's held up well. Jay can talk to this, but I would say in international markets you don't have the same level of kind of wellness benefit, if you will, in terms of just how they provide care. And what we saw in markets in Europe and in Asia was very strong recovery, kind of some benefits from some pent-up demand and kind of gravitation more towards kind of pre-COVID type volume growth rates late in Q3. And so I think it's early to look at how new lockdowns might impact the business.  Clearly that had been a factor back in March and April. I think the markets have learned to adapt here to continue to provide services. As mentioned earlier I think we would anticipate this could cause some constraints on areas like instrument placements, and you know there is always a chance selectively this could impact some underlying demand or prioritization of services, but I think it's early for us to make any projections on that front. Yes, at a high level we're transitioning from a period early on where we tried to be really cautious on investments with a lot of unknowns in front of us with business growth. And like many companies, froze hiring and pulled back on compensation and tried to ensure we're in a good place. And we are now going through a period where we have a higher level of confidence on the underlying market growth. We are getting ready for 2021 and thinking about how we're going to manage our business going forward. And we're starting to advance new hiring and positions that we had frozen, and things we wanted to move forward with. We're adding staffing in our labs to try to keep up with 20%-plus volume growth. And I think this is more indicative of us having a higher level of confidence in the kind of the underlying market demand and how COVID may impact our business and ensuring we're prepared for that going forward. We are doing catch up on areas, I can tell you in central compensation accruals and things like that, that we were quite conservative earlier in the year and we're in a better place to support that now. And we reinstated salary reductions and reinstated 401(k) reductions and things like that. So there is some of that going on. But I think the bigger picture here is we're looking at a market and our business that's growing at very healthy rates, and we want to ensure that we're investing towards that and supporting that and have confidence that we can do that well while delivering financial performance that's aligned with our long-term goals. No. I think that's all the right kind of background. I think we - as Jay noted, we'll be rolling this out gradually through the year or - so some of this will depend on how the exact timing of how that phases. And I think the Catalyst One launch is a reasonable benchmark. But we'll provide more insight on that as we get closer to year-end call, we'll give some more indications of how we're feeling about that outlook. Let me give you some metrics that maybe can help with this a little bit which is over the last five years, so if you break down the revenue per practice, Diagnostics revenue growth per practice growth that Jay referred in the call, it was about a 7.5% increase on average over the last five years. Roughly 3% of that was from visit growth. 0.5% contribution came from frequency, so that's the percentage of visits that include Diagnostics. And about 4% of that, which we mentioned was growth in Diagnostics revenue per visit. So year-to-date what we're seeing is 1% from clinical visit growth, a 3.5% contribution from frequency increases, and a 6% increase from revenue increases. And so we're learning about this. But to answer your question, it is both volume, which would be the frequency dynamic and the revenue piece, and that is the central question. Kind of like what's going on here? Is this sustainable? Do we see this expanding over time?  Clearly, the clinical visit dynamics we're coming to understand. In terms of it's healthy overall, and perhaps there's some benefit from new patients that can sustain. But I think this underlying trend of diagnostic frequency and utilization which has been a long-term trend for us, expanding it, the question is are some of the things going on through the pandemic, some of the learnings, the changing how service is being delivered, could that set the stage for some accelerated growth? So early to predict it. We're encouraged by it, and it's certainly consistent with what we've been trying to do in the market. So it's something that we look to build upon. I think we're out of time, unfortunately, so we're going to..."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered exceptional performance in Q3, driven by sustained strong underlying market trends in our global CAG business. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were supported in part by pent up demand for health care services, as well as a continued overall shift towards a provision of more veterinary services. These services are often enabled by a higher use and intensity of diagnostics. Delivering excellent patient care is the key value proposition of veterinarians and to treat, they must first diagnosis. Proprietary IDEXX diagnostics place an important role in this paradigm. We've continued to see a clear, V-shape recovery in Companion Animal health care and these trends point toward a potential sustained level of accelerated growth for diagnostics testing. Let me start with a brief update on our market trends, including observations on how our customers are adapting and review the exceptional execution of our commercial organization in engaging and supporting tell them. As Brian noted, we've seen solid growth in same-store clinical visits in key markets like the U.S. as well as sustained, strong recovery in clinic demand across our international markets. The factors supporting these results has been pent up demand for pet health care, evidenced by 11% growth in wellness visits in Q3. We've begun to see some moderation in these very high growth levels, while non-wellness visits, which we estimate account for approximately 60% of overall clinical visits and approximately 70% or more of related diagnostic revenues, continue to expand at a healthy 3% rate. Many pet owners, just like a significant number of IDEXX employees, continue to work from home and are spending significantly more time with their pets; were likely more attuned to their well-being, resulting in higher practice visits. These trends further reinforce the strong global recovery and health of our markets. As we work through the market recovery, additional factors are emerging, which have supported very high growth levels in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary clinics appear to be increasing their standard of care at an accelerated pace. Evidence of this can be seen in the average percentage of U.S. clinical visits that use diagnostics. This averaged approximately 45% in Q3 of 2019. While in Q3 of 2020, this metric was approximately 200 basis points higher. To put this higher step up in context, an average 50 basis point per year increase was more typical in recent years. Not only do more visits include diagnostics, but the intensity is measured by revenue, has also increased. Growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to the U.S. has increased to approximately 6% year to date compared to 4% growth in recent years. Pandemic workflow procedures like curbside drop-off and the desire to take more a comprehensive health care approach may be supporting these promising trends. Diagnostic revenue growth per practice continues to expand as a result of these factors. U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics revenue growth per practice increased 10.5% in 2020 compared to approximately 7.5% over the last five years. This is despite slowing of clinical visits due to the pandemic to 1% year to date compared to a five-year average of 3%. Our expanded commercial presence and focus on supporting the vet practice with innovative technology and insight for practice development continues to drive these favorable dynamics at a steadily improving rate. While we may see some moderation in these trends moving forward, these healthy dynamics reinforce a potential long-term positive backdrop for Diagnostic's market growth. Increases in the use of diagnostic speak to the willingness of pet owners to prioritize care for the health and well-being of their family members even during times of economic uncertainty. It also reinforces the increasing role of services in the vet clinic business model, reflected in an accelerated shift in diagnostics as a percentage of practice revenues. U.S. Diagnostic revenues as a percentage of total practice revenue reached 16.3% in Q3, approximately 100 basis points above prior year levels and compared to an average 25 basis point increase in recent years. For vet clinics, diagnostic services are one of the most profitable areas in the practice, and these trends can help mitigate the impacts of accelerated migration of product sales to online channels. An additional emerging factor that appears to be supporting higher service and diagnostics growth is an increase in first-time clinical patients. Anecdotally, we've all seen and heard about increased interest in adopting puppies and kittens during the pandemic. While this is a difficult area to measure, we are seeing a meaningful increase in first-time clinical visits in our market tracking data. Year-on-year growth in first-time clinical visits measured to our U.S. practice intelligence database has increased an average of 8% year to date with accelerated growth since April, compared to approximately 2% year-on-year growth in recent years. As Brian noted, we estimate that incremental new-patient growth added approximately 1% to clinical-visit growth in Q3 overall. In our own business, we've seen a meaningful step up in the number of U.S. hospitals running progesterone tests in average run levels, reinforcing a potential increase in breeding activity. While it's early to project the potential impact from these trends, evidence is emerging that there is an accelerated increase in growth in the U.S. pet population. While we recognize the potential for future business disruption related to the pandemic, these very encouraging trends are reinforcing our confidence in the long-term potential for our CAG business. Our Commercial organization is at the center of enabling this market development. So next, I will highlight key developments in our Commercial agenda. Our Commercial execution in Q3 was excellent. We saw solid continued recovery in instrument placements in North America and in international regions with 3,173 premium instrument placements globally in the quarter, including 1,700 Catalyst placements, with close to 70% in new and competitive accounts. Access to practices continued to improve through Q3, with in-person visits by our customer-account managers now at approximately 50% in-person in the U.S., and approximately 60% in Q3 on average in Europe. While underlying market demand for diagnostics has remained strong, we expect that sales professionals' access to veterinary clinics will likely continued to be pressured as social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 remain dynamic and continue to impact veterinary care. As highlighted during Investor Day, a key multiyear strategy is to scale our commercial footprint on a rolling basis in targeted international markets. These expansion efforts reflect a tremendous opportunity as two-thirds of the potential total addressable market over time will be outside the U.S. Leveraging the commercial playbook of best practices, we develop through multiple expansions in the U.S., our international expansion roadmap is tracking to plan. In Q3, we successfully launched programmatic efforts to essentially double our commercial footprint in two important European markets over the coming months. We expect to continue to make great progress on these initiatives through the remainder of the year, with all talent hired, trained and on-boarded by first-half of 2021. These efforts complement the strong commercial momentum resulting from investments made over the past several years in Europe. For example, our newly opened and now our largest reference lab in the world in Kornwestheim, Germany, is fully functional and providing differentiated menu and excellent service levels across Europe. Additionally, Hematology is a very important modality internationally. And the announcement of ProCyte One has been enthusiastically received by customers. Finally, customers across Europe have embraced our IDEXX 360 program which was configured to the unique needs of key markets in the region with over 50% of premium instruments placed in the quarter using IDEXX 360, a new high. The combination of innovations like ProCyte One, Kornwestheim and IDEXX 360, coupled with an expanded commercial footprint in select countries are key elements of our growth strategy. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care Program is key focus for our commercial and corporate accounts team in the second half of the year. Program results recovered in Q3 with strong adoption of the IDEXX Preventative Care Program with approximately 230 new enrollees in the quarter supported by sustained high wellness visits traffic. This brings our total enrolled practice level to over 4,500. Enrollments in the program approached pre-COVID levels in the latter part of the quarter, which is evidence that customers continue to embrace the IDEXX preventative care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to recover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics Another prioritized area of ongoing focus is supporting customers with integrated solutions that support practice productivity, and best medicine. A great example of this is our new hematology analyzer, ProCyte One, recently launched for pre-sale. Both our commercials teams, which were trained last month, and customers are very excited by the performance, usability, and cost profile of the analyzer. We are making solid progress with field trials with approximately 20 units at customer sites and more to follow over the next month. Customer use feedback in a live environment is part of our time-tested approach to ensure that we only ship when the solution is ready to support patient care in the most demanding and varied practice environments. We plan to begin shipping in Q1 with a gradual build in placements over the balance of the year. Expanding our premium installed base is a long-term objective for IDEXX with approximately 200,000 opportunities for placements globally including almost 100,000 hematology placements encompassing competitive, greenfield and upgrades for current customers with legacy analyzers. ProCyte One enables us to access a much broader part of the marketplace as it it's packed with the latest technology and simplicity, facilitating efficiency of the practice and trusted reference lab quality results. It also has affordable economics, including paper run billing and an inventory replenishment. From a clinical perspective, chemistry and hematology complement each other to provide a four-clinic clinical patient profile. Coupled with our Catalyst One chemistry platform with a growing menu of eight new tests in eight years, ProCyte One is yet another proof point of our commitment to brave comprehensive reference lab quality blood analysis to the point of care, the solutions that are both suited to small and large practices globally. And with our comprehensive program, IDEXX 360, we make access to advanced diagnostics easy and hassle-free for customers, with no up-front equipment costs. We have over the last year expanded IDEXX 360 to offer programs with flexible, early year commitments for new practice formations. This has been extremely well-received by these practices and enables us to grow with them from their earliest days. We also continue to see positive customer experience and adoption of our innovations and product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. A great case in point is our digital cytology service offering. Our first customer satisfaction survey scores were best in class. Customers are delighted with the under two hours, 24 by 7 results promise we consistently deliver on. Moreover, we make reference lab services ordering and results viewing easy and convenient for our customers with our VetConnect PLUS diagnostic results portal. And more recently with IDEXX reference lab data and IVLS. IVLS was formerly used by customers jus with our point of care in clinic suite, but now approximately 2,700 customers are already taking advantage of this new IVLS functionality for reference lab results, too. As noted on our last earnings call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April and over half our North American customers have used the advanced bacteria kit to date. Detecting bacteria and urine is a key driver of clinical value, and we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive even greater appreciation of our SediVue platform. Our IDEXX urinalysis anywhere strategy further differentiates us by offering customer solutions that are unique, providing common flexibility to test at the practice or our lab, with seamless order integration and unified pricing. Our customers value our holistic customer-centric approach like urinalysis anywhere, and we see that appreciation reflected in very high customer retention rates. Moving on to our veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging businesses. We saw strong new software system placements in Q3, supported by the hard work of our commercial organization and the healthy pipeline they built earlier in the year, with 35% growth year-over-year in new PIMS placements globally, including on premise and cloud systems. Although diagnostic imaging new systems placements decreased year-over-year, as access to veterinary practices was pressured by COVID-19, our customers are excited about the ImageVue DR30, our new digital imaging system we announced in August. The DR30, along with our other imaging products offers the most advanced digital imaging technology in a market, with software capabilities that provides streamlined workflow and efficiency of the practice. The continued growth of our software and digital imaging systems install base and subscription customers for cloud solutions are driving strong, double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues. As we advance our commercial capabilities, we're also advancing our commitment to the positive impact we make in the communities we serve. Today I'm excited to share that we have established an IDEXX foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund with a contribution of $10 million to support activities aligned with our purpose: to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. As part of IDEXX's overall corporate responsibility efforts, IDEXX has invested for decades in organizations and initiatives aligned with our purpose and guiding principles. The IDEXX foundation will complement our ongoing local partnerships while also broadening our geographic reach and social impact. The IDEXX foundation's priorities will be on long-term outcomes-focused investments in areas such as supporting education in the veterinary and stem fields, including diversity, equity and inclusion in animal health care. We're excited about this important step in support of our purpose and mission. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities also continues to be a top priority for us. The majority of IDEXX employees continue to work remotely and as travel remains limited, employees leverage virtual technology to stay connected and engaged from their home offices. Our on-site teams continue to execute at very high levels to support exceptional market demand, while maintaining important health and safety procedures. Overall, we're excited about the strong, continued market performance and resilience in animal health and more specifically, in our category. We're positioning ourselves to support continued strong growth, aligned with our long-term potential and financial goals. This means continued investment in innovative solutions that solve the most challenging problems faced by veterinarians. And the expanded commercial capability to bring the innovations to new and existing customers and markets. While the resilience of our industry and IDEXX's business in particular is extraordinary, the situation remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor closely the pandemic's impact on consumers and pet owners and react appropriately. Lastly, I would like to take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers for their resilience and perseverance during economic uncertainties and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together in the last two quarters and look forward to the journey still before us. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Yes, thanks. Thanks, Ryan. I'll take that, and Brian may add some additional color. We see the international opportunity as very significant, about two-thirds of the potential addressable market. And we know our international customers, pet owners, love their pets as much as we do. So it's really a question of helping to develop the marketplace. We see a lot of parallels to what we've done in the U.S. to market creation overseas. So that speaks to the investments we've made in terms of field footprint which brings diagnostics subject-matter experts, a reference lab which builds out the lab network and provide the type of service levels our European customers in this case expect, a number of investments in information management solutions, as well as products like Catalyst One, and now ProCyte One that fit those markets really well from a footprint and price standpoint. So we saw very nice growth in international, 29% recurring revenue on an organic basis. We have seen some renewal second wave, third wave of cases in parts of the U.S., but also parts of Europe. We think our customers will work through that. We'll work through that with them. That can provide potentially some short-term headwinds. But overall, the investments are really pointed towards the long-term potential growth of the marketplace. Brian, did you want to add anything to that? Keep in mind, that's a trend that's been going on for a while, the pivot to online sales, both pharmaceutical, probably more so on the specialty-diet front. If anything, COVID may have accelerated that. And we have seen veterinarians, even pre-COVID, talk about the fact that they are pivoting to focus more on delivering veterinary services. And to treat, you obviously have to diagnose, so we do think it's an area of the practice that's not tradable. It's not going to migrate outside the practice just by its very nature. So we do see that as a positive trend that it had already existed. And it may accelerate over time, but not necessarily unique to the COVID environment. Sure. In terms of the telemedicine, as part of revised workflows that practice has adopted early on, so this goes back to sort of the April/May time frame with patient curbside drop off and pickup and restricted access. A lot of practices look to telemedicine solutions. It's primarily more a software solution than something you would see on the human side with Teladoc. And our solutions integrate with the telemedicine offerings on the marketplace. And we have seen a lot of interest in it. Whether or not that sustains post-COVID remains to be seen. We think, ultimately, it's a positive for our business, especially if it brings like more cats into the practice and initial diagnoses of cats that may require a physical visit to the practice. In terms of preventive care, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw towards the tail end of the quarter more or less pre-COVID levels of enrollments. So we were 230 or so for the quarter which is slightly less than pre-COVID, but again there was movement towards the end of the quarter to more normal levels. And that's to be expected. These type of programs require a fair amount of in-clinic access from both an on-boarding and repeated training standpoint across the entire staff. But there is tremendous interest in the programs that piggyback on the tremendous interest in wellness in general. I think tying together your question and Ryan's question, it really does speak to the service orientation that we see amongst veterinarians, and obviously wellness and preventative care is a big piece of that. Yes, I'll provide a couple comments on that, and Brian may add some additional flavor. We did see a fairly dramatic recovery from Q2 levels. That capital equipment placement is both a function of clinic access \u2013 and that has remained somewhat restricted. We're at 50% in the U.S., 60% overall in-person visits internationally \u2013 but it's also a function, as Brian indicated in his remarks, of just the prefaces are busy. And if you think about placing an in-clinic suite that requires training and some workflow modifications, integration into their local network, they have to hit the pause button for some period of time in which to be able to do that. And when they're working pretty much the full days without a lot of gaps in their schedules that can be challenging in itself. But we do expect continued recovery throughout the year. It's really just a function of you know COVID-19 and the environment and its impact on practice access. Well. I will - oh, go ahead. Yes, let me just build on a couple of those points. Our international markets are more biased towards in-clinic testing as well as non-wellness or sick patient testing, which is less impacted by COVID-related social distancing policies. So to Brian's point we believe we have seen a return to more or less pre-COVID levels internationally, but the mix and flavor is a little bit different than what we've seen in the U.S. And with the non-wellness testing, the percentage of diagnostics usage is also higher. It's close to 80% or so from a split standpoint between non-wellness and wellness. So hopefully that gives you some flavor on potential impacts Sure. I think about ProCyte One more from the standpoint, just as a benchmark analog more from the standpoint that Catalyst One as a reasonable benchmark for pace of the placement belt. Keep in mind, Catalyst One had a longer presale period than ProCyte One, so you got to take that into consideration. To your point, it is - hematology is a more established marketplace. There's certainly, I think a lot of interest for it. But the way we're rolling it out is first in North America and then follow quickly thereafter internationally, where there's a really nice, I think two-thirds plus of the opportunity is there. So you would have to take that into consideration. The other thing is, ProCyte One will have a - we believe it'll have a very high attach rate with chemistry. So our focus is really on being able to place suites of chemistry, hematology and potentially, urinalysis versus just taking ProCyte One, and let's say upgrading a laser site account or just a single competitive hematology account. Brian, did you want to add anything to that? We're shooting for the same long-term goals, Jon. So it's that 50 to 100 is \u2013 that's, we think a very reasonable estimate. We think we can deliver that in this kind of business. Clearly, you adjust for certain things like the litigation accrual things that are one-time in nature that we try to highlight, right. But you know, we're not providing specific guidance, but we have the same long-term goals. And as you know, when we're executing well in our growth and we have high CAG Diagnostic recurring growth, it puts us in a good position to deliver against the goals and support investment of the business. So more to follow on that but same goals for the business. Yes. I'll give you just maybe some additional flavor on that. So just setting aside the pent-up demand piece because I think from a wellness standpoint I think a lot of that worked through in Q3. So the two or three maybe rather longer-term trends we're tracking from a sustainability standpoint is the new clinical patient visits, and we think that that is something that obviously if there is a lot of new puppies and kittens to the marketplace that they're going to need care, and that as they age. So that's certainly a positive. And we want to more data and see how that develops over time. And then I spoke to use and intensity of diagnostics, and that's tied up in this whole pivot to service, use in terms of more visits include diagnostics, and intensity when they use diagnostics it's at a higher average dollar volume. And some of that is in our control in terms of our commercial approach and innovations and being able to provide to veterinarians the tools that allow them to cover it more. So that's certainly something that we've invested in even pre-COVID, and I think we're seeing the fruits of it. And it may be on top of an accelerated pivot to services that we see on the part of veterinarians. So certainly, those are positives for the business. I think we just need more time to see how they play out and at what level. Big driver in Q3 was lab productivity when we had 20-plus percent kind of growth and controls on costs. And we're not projecting sustained 24% kind of grow-through levels in the lab business. We're encouraged by the trends. So that is \u2013 we think that we'll continue to be able to get lab productivity, and we do need to add staffing. But that's more of a moderator than it is something that's a headwind if you will. So I think we do think we're in a good position to continue to get positive gross margin gains when you have high CAG recurring growth, and we're just highlighting that we're adding some investments back in the business, and trying to position ourselves going forward. So it's more of something that will moderate the gains. And just to reinforce, our goals are annually 50 to 100 bps of improvement, and we want to deliver good performance, but also ensure that we continue to invest towards long-term market development. And that's what we're working on as we're heading into next year. Well, yes, so let me try to address that on a couple different levels. The practice revenue growth has been obviously very strong over the year. We saw 10.5%, 11% most recently. So that's \u2013 obviously, our Diagnostics growth has been faster than that, and we've always believed that Diagnostics enables and drives services within the practice. And your question as the longer-term sustainability feeds into the discussion that we have previously around the pivot to services, veterinarians interested and obviously meeting demand for new clinical patient visits as well as being able to focus on what they do best, which is caring for patients. But I think is a positive backdrop for all the reasons cited, and we'll see how that plays out. Yes, so want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call, and I want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these obviously challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering the day. And I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions. So, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional question. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon\nBrian McKeon: Good morning everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter. We benefited from a V-shaped recovery and our CAG business and flow through profit benefits from favorable product mix and discipline cost controls. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 3% as reported and 4% organically supported by 7% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Following a period of significant pressure on CAG diagnostic testing volumes in late March through mid-April, we saw a sharp recovery in market demand for diagnostics globally in the second quarter, including very high growth levels in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness and non-wellness testing. Better than expected CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth and benefits from proactive cost controls drove a 410 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. This enabled delivery of $1.72 in early earnings per share, an increase of 23% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the first half of 2020, we delivered an EPS of $3.01, up 18% on a comparable constant currency basis despite headwinds related to the COVID pandemic. As we'll discuss solid pet healthcare market growth trends have continued in July, pointing to a foundation for continued solid revenue growth for our core CAG business. We're also well-positioned in terms of our financial management approach, aligned with our goal to deliver operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth in the second half of 2020. While we're very encouraged by recent market trends and our ability to manage through the COVID pandemic effectively, we recognize the potential future effects related to the pandemic may be dynamic and challenging to project. As such, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 at this time. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 4% was driven by 7% organic gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets. Our overall revenue growth also benefited by 1% from our OPTI human PCR test initiative. These gains offset impacts related to the pandemic, which reduced new IDEXX VetLab and digital instrument placements, and pressured non-compliance water testing. We also saw impacts from the reversal of March stocking orders and our water and LPD businesses, which reduced Q2 revenues by 4.5 million or less than 1%. As noted, our overall performance was driven by growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, which strengthened considerably through Q2. By month, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues declined approximately 16% in April, increased 8% in May, and grew an impressive 30% in June, supported by strong gains across our major modalities. Consistent solid revenue trends were seen across our major regions, reflecting the global strength and resilience of the veterinary healthcare market. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by a rebound in clinical visits as demonstrated in our same store U.S. weekly tracking data, published in our earnings snapshot available on our website. Following an 18% contraction in clinical visits in April, same-store clinical visits amounted to plus 2% in May and plus 7% in June, resulting in a 3% overall decline for the quarter. Early quarter pressure on testing was greater in wellness visits, which were down 5% for the quarter overall, but rebounded strongly in May and June. Non-wellness visits which we estimate drive about 75% of U.S. diagnostics revenue were down only 1% on the same basis in Q2. Clinical visit activity outpaced overall vet practice visit activity in the second quarter, as business mix of veterinary clinics has shifted towards more service based offerings. These dynamics supported a solid 2.5% increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2, despite a 5% decline in overall visits to clinics in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the broad market recovery. These solid trends have continued in July reflected in gains of 6%, and U.S. same store clinical visits through the first three weeks ended July 17, with solid growth now reflected across major U.S. regions. Please note that there is some latency in the reporting in the most recent weekly data, with these metrics continuing to improve as additional visit data is added over time. We believe the health and resilience of the global pet healthcare market is a positive factor that can support continued solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. These improved market trends supported a strong recovery in IDEXX revenues in the quarter. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 7% in Q2, reflecting 6% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions offset by a 1% FX headwind. Results reflected high single digit gains in the U.S. and modest overall organic growth in international markets as strong gains in key regions like Germany, Japan, and Australia were offset by lockdown related impacts in the UK and Canada. IDEXX vet lab consumable revenues increased an impressive 13% on an organic basis despite early quarter pandemic related impacts, reflecting low-to-mid teen growth in both U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium installed base. As expected, CAG instrument placements were constrained in Q2 impacted by restrictions on sales access to veterinary clinics, and deferrals of new purchase decisions. This contributed to a 19 million or 40% year-on-year decline in reporting CAG instrument revenue in the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high reflected in 165 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, and 536 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 231 second catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 16% year-on-year growth and our global catalyst installed base. We also achieved 545 premium hematology placements in 275 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9,500 instruments, up 25% year-on-year. As Jay will discuss our field sales forces, we\u2019d focus on rebuilding the new instrument pipeline globally as we gradually gain increased access to vet clinics. Rapid Assay revenues decreased 5% organically in Q2; primarily reflecting early quarter pandemic related volume pressure, as well as year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing and activity. Consistent with our overall trends, Rapid Assay revenues showed a strong rebound from nearly 40% year-on-year revenue declines in April to nearly 30% year-on-your gains in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues declined 3% organically overall. Double digit gains and recurring service revenues were offset by declines in new veterinary software and diagnostic imaging system placements, reflecting pandemic related constraints on new sales activities. Turning to our other business segments following a 16% organic gain in our water business in Q1, we saw a 16% organic growth revenue decline in Q2. Second quarter results were impacted by the reversal of 2 million of accelerated stocking orders, reducing organic growth by 7%. The vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service, albeit with some disruption in early Q2 related to business lockdown effects, as well as beach and pool closures. Approximately 20% of our water revenues are from non-compliance testing related to areas like special projects, construction, and real estate transactions. We saw a greater than expected decline in this area related to reduced overall business activity and prioritization of lab spending. While we saw improvement in water revenue trends as we work through the quarter, we anticipate that non-compliance testing demand will be uneven in the near to moderate term, as public and private testing labs and public utilities adapt to pandemic related macro impacts. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 2% overall in Q2, net of an estimated 2.5 million or 8% headwind related to the reversal of accelerated stocking orders. LPD results continue to benefit from a demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever, an improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We're also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally.  Overall, LPD gains were moderated in Q2 as expected by lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of bovine herd populations in key Asia Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Finally, as noted, IDEXX overall growth in Q2 benefited by approximately 1% from revenues associated with our [OPTI] and COVID-19 PCR test. This includes benefits from our initial test supply program with the state of Maine. We're extending these support efforts through the implementation of a lab based testing capability in partnership with the Maine CDC that will provide capacity for up to 350,000 human COVID tests over the next several months. We're continuing to focus on supporting COVID PCR testing globally leveraging the capabilities of our OPTI human and LPD businesses. We note that human PCR testing is a very dynamic area with shorter-term project commitments, and growing competition from alternative suppliers that make demand difficult to project. In addition to these efforts, we recently completed work to adapt our OPTI PCR test for use in wastewater samples, which will be offered to IDEXX water customers through our water commercial organization. We're very pleased to be leveraging the capability of IDEXX to contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Turning to the P&L, profit results were very strong in Q2 benefiting from solid revenue gains favorable product mix, and proactive steps to manage costs in the context of the pandemic. These actions supported 380 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 410 basis points on a constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 18% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $1.72 per share, including benefits of 4.9 million or $0.06 per share related to share based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 23%. Gross profit increased 6% as reported or 8% on a constant currency basis in Q2. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a constant currency basis supported by net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues, benefits from moderate net price gains, and solid productivity improvement in our lab operations supported by tight cost controls. In the second half of 2020, we'll see relative increases in our reference lab costs reflecting the on-boarding of our new German core laboratory. And as we add lab staffing to ensure high customer service levels globally in a growing market. Operating expenses in Q2 decreased 4% as reported and 2% on a constant currency basis. As noted on our last call, we advanced a targeted 25 million of quarterly operating expense reductions, compared to our original spending plans to mitigate potential impacts from the pandemic.  Benefits from these initiatives, as well as approximately $5 million in lower than expected health and dental costs were realized in the quarter. These efficiencies in combination with stronger than expected revenue growth enabled 200 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Given the strong recovery in our business, we've discontinued temporary salary and benefit reductions, which yielded an estimated 13 million in savings in the second quarter. In the second half of 2020, we intend to advance targeted hiring and prioritize investments in supportive or long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability while delivering solid operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth. In terms of cash flow, we generated 236 million in positive cash flow year-to-date. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 80% or 93% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarters expansion, and German lab relocation, which are now largely complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position enhanced by steps in Q2 to add to our liquidity and flexibility. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.26 times net of cash with 105 million in cash and 877 million in capacity available on our expanded $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter and it contend to continue prioritizing funding of our growth strategy and business operations this year. Overall, we're very pleased with strong momentum and level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q2. IDEXX is a great business model with tremendous long-term potential. We're very pleased to have managed through the first half of 2020 effectively, despite the pandemic impacts, and look forward to building on that progress. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Today, we're pleased to report excellent Q2 results supported by a sharp global recovery in the pet healthcare market. As Brian noted in Q2, we delivered 4% overall organic growth and a 7% increase in CAG diagnostics recurring revenues, despite significant early quarter headwinds related to stay at home policies. We've managed well the initial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we've seen a strong and sustained recovery in our core companion animal health business that is highly encouraging and reinforces our optimism and the long-term growth potential of our business. Proactive cost discipline allowed us to deliver strong profit gains, while ensuring ongoing investment in our innovation programs, a high level of continued service for our customers, and investments in the health and safety of our employees. This strong level of performance reflects IDEXX\u2019s extraordinary resilience. It gives us confidence in our ability to sustain solid growth and financial results as we manage through the ongoing dynamics associated with the pandemic. Let me start with a brief update on our supply chain performance, market trends, observations on how our customers are adapting, and the success of our commercial organization and engaging customers to support the recovery of the market. IDEXX has applied veterinary practices in an uninterrupted fashion with point-of-care diagnostic products and services like reference lab testing, and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future.  Our manufacturing operations which are largely based in the U.S. have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our reference lab performance has also been especially noteworthy, in light of disrupted in challenging logistics more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employees safe. Our network lab capability enables us to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption in the event of a COVID-19 infection. These capabilities are possible through significant investments that have been made over a long period of time, in lab density, common lab information management systems, and courier route of logistics capability. Not having to worry about service or product availability, our customers have been able to focus on their mission of caring for patients and have been highly resilient through the pandemic. They have now expanded the breadth of services provided from the early COVID-19 focus on sick and emergency patient services.  As Brian noted, despite an overall 5% decline in the same practice visit levels and Q2, vet clinics were able to increase in-practice revenues by 2.5%, supported by an increased emphasis of medical services enabled by diagnostics testing. Customers have adapted to new ways of delivering service, such as an increased use of telehealth and curbside checking where the pet owner remains in a car during the appointment. Staff from veterinary clinics have indicated that this has increased their comfort level with recommending more comprehensive and clinically relevant diagnostics with support from pet owners. Veterinarian\u2019s also say that they are increasingly focused on delivering core medical services for their patients, as a result of the substitution of product sales to e-retailers, which have accelerated. To treat, veterinarians have to first diagnose and IDEXX\u2019s proprietary diagnostics are a key tool in advancing the standard of care. Supported by these trends, we've seen solid improvement in both wellness and non-wellness visits with additional acceleration of wellness visits more recently reflecting in-part pent-up demand. The proportion of clinical visits, including at least one diagnostic has increased since March in both wellness and-non wellness visits. In addition, we're seeing greater dollars of diagnostic revenue per clinical visit. Overall, the average diagnostic revenue per clinical visit in 2020 that included at least one diagnostic has been trending above previous years levels as well, approximately 5% higher for the first half of 2020 versus the first half of 2019. In fact, diagnostics revenue per critical visit overall, and per non-wellness visit has been higher than in 2019 every month this year. We're also seeing evidence of increased interest in pivot ownership through the pandemic, including among current pet owners, another indication of the strengthening of the pet human bond. These improvement trends are global and have sustained in early Q3, as evidenced by continued solid U.S. clinical growth trends, albeit at moderated levels from the extraordinary growth rates seen in June. We are monitoring the evolution of the pandemic and associated management of infection rate growth across regions, which may impact future demand. We remain encouraged by the solid global recovery in demand in our core CAG business supported by an ever growing pet owner bond. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. We\u2019re very pleased with the effectiveness of our global commercial team during a period with a very challenging market backdrop. Field occupancy remains in the high 90s and customers appreciate that the cadence and level of our field visits, whether they are physical or virtual in nature are at very high levels. Our global teams also showed tremendous agility in supporting our customers during this period, including designing and implementing a new remote instrument install and training process, which enabled us to successfully onboard new customers in a safe and effective way when requested. Some of these new processes enabled us to place over 1,800 premium instruments globally in a quarter, including over 1,000 catalyst placements, with over 700 in new and competitive accounts. Our field service representatives continue to be welcomed by veterinary practices, and we've seen an increase in in-person visits by our customer account managers up to 40% in June, versus the 25% we saw in April for the U.S. While pandemic related factors have constrained CAG instrument placements, as well as new software system implementations and pressure new digital imaging system sales, we expect the pace of capital placements to gradually improve over the balance of the year. Our field teams have used this time to build pipelines in the rate in which this improvement occurs will be related to ongoing improvement to VDC access to veterinary practices and to hire practice owner confidence that will inevitably come with an economic recovery. As Brian noted, moving forward, we will be augmenting our commercial presence internationally. Our approach will be to add resources selectively on a rolling basis in targeted markets, leveraging the capabilities of our new global commercial model, which we look forward to discussing more at our upcoming Investor Day. We're encouraged by the resilience of the companion animal market, and believe there is a significant long-term opportunity to increase standards of care globally supported by our direct commercial capability. As we support customers, we're working to continue to advance programs that support a higher level of care, such as preventive care, we saw continued adoption of the IDEXX preventive care program with over 100 new enrollees in a quarter supported by the strong recovery and market demand for veterinary services and robust wellness visits traffic, bringing our total enrolled practice level to 4,300.  As expected, our Q2 additions were reduced from prior quarters as this is a program that requires broad practice access to onboard and train a large number of staff. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to uncover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care program is a key focus for our commercial team in the second half of the year in our recover together initiative. As we support continued market recovery, we also continue to advance our new product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. Through capital placements have experienced some near-term headwinds in the second quarter as a result of restricted practice access, digital cytology is experiencing strong customer interest. With our sophisticated information management systems and clinical pathology experts around the globe, we were able to provide results very often in well under the two hour commitment, allowing veterinarians to provide close to real time cytology professional services. Our technology for life philosophy, as represented by the introduction of Bile Acids in our IDEXX vet lab instrumentation suite has also been received with strong enthusiasm. Bile Acids reflects the eighth parameter introduced in catalyst over the last eight years. We are pleased with the breadth of global adoption to date as about a 1,000 customers across 35 countries have now utilized Bile Acids on catalyst with reference on a quality performance. As noted on the last call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April, and over 750 customers have now utilized the kit. Detecting bacteria in urine is a key driver of clinical value. And we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive an even greater appreciation for and testing with the SediVue platform. In addition to keeping innovations on track, as Brian discussed, we brought new COVID-19 test to market for both animals and people by leveraging core technical and manufacturing capability. We also continue to advance our operating capability. We're excited \u2013 very excited and have completed the move into our new European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. There are now houses over 500 employees with state of the art capabilities and automation.  Our Kornwestheim facility will enable us to further optimize our lab network in Europe, expand service levels and bring improved efficiency, while supporting our continued growth for years to come. Kornwestheim is now the largest lab in our global network. And the dedication and perseverance of our team made it possible to bring this lab online in the middle of a pandemic. Moving to our VSS business, although we face some headwinds related to new software and diagnostic imaging system placements as access to veterinary practices was impacted by COVID-19, we had excellent double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues, supported by the expansion of our customers subscription base for cloud solutions like Web PACS, SmartFlow, and Neo to highlight a few applications. We also saw hundreds of customers take advantage of integrated software solutions like secure remote access in telehealth that help practices, manage their business in this environment. We continue to strengthen our leadership and global execution and software, and are excited to announce the addition Michael Schreck as Corporate Vice President and General Manager, IDEXX veterinary software and services reporting to me. Michael has over 20 years of experience in industry leading software and technology. He has global responsibility for our customer facing software business, and will work closely with our global CAG commercial team to advanced software solutions to support more efficient workflows, and practice management, improved patient care, and value-added services that drive the overall health of veterinary practices. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities continue to be a top priority for us. Though we have begun to bring back a small number of employees engaged product development with their benefits on site access, the majority of IDEXX employees continued to work remotely, and travel remains highly restricted. We are providing spending allowance for many of our remote workers to help them maintain a health and safety work environment outside of our facilities. I'm especially appreciative of our employees around the world whose role required them to work on-site during these last several months, in order to provide essential services to our customers. Health and safety procedures continue to advance for on-site employees in addition to physical distancing and PPE now also include daily temperature checks in many locations.  Given improved market and business trends, we're happy to share that we've discontinued temporary reductions in employee salary and benefits. In light of the recovery in market demand, we are adding resources to critical areas like manufacturing and live operations to ensure we can support market demand and customer service levels moving forward. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Our 2020 media employee engagement survey showed an all-time high employee engagement level for the organization during a period in which a global pandemic has created significant business and personal challenges for our employees. Overall, we're very encouraged by the strong recovery in our business. The resilience of our industry and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular is extraordinary. We're positioning ourselves to support sustained market growth, while delivering solid financial performance as we continue to advance our long-term strategy. In this context, I would be remiss, if I didn't take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers. Our customers continue to provide medical services against the backdrop of economic uncertainties, and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. As many of us, including the pet owners, we couldn't be more appreciative. And a huge thank you to my IDEXX colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts in continuing to support these customers and our business. I\u2019m very proud of what we accomplished this past quarter. In closing, we're looking forward to our first ever virtual Investor Day on Thursday, August 13. We will share updates on our long-term opportunity, strategic priorities, and financial goals. You can now register for the event on the investor relations section of our website. Participating in the event will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, CFO; Tina Hunt, General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Michael Lane, General Manager of Reference Labs and Information Technology; Jim Polewaczyk, the Chief Commercial Officer. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the line comes from Mr. Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Brian, Jay, I want to start with, you know, your comments clearly indicate that conditions improved throughout June and July, and your snapshot data and a lot of other third party data indicates that right now, we're at a run rate that's, you know, in-line with, if not above prior year trends. I'm just curious given the improved trends we've seen in recent months, what factors went into the decision to not reissue guide? Is there any additional uncertainty you're anticipating? Is it tied to some, you know, potentially economic sensitivity later in the year, could you just, you know, give us an insight into [indiscernible]? And I have a follow-up.\nBrian McKeon: Well, as you know, I think we're very encouraged by the trends in the business and our execution. The decision to continue to suspend guidance is not reflective of a lack of optimism for the business. I think it's more just reflective of its \u2013 continues to be a dynamic. You can see 30% growth in the business in June, you know, we have, you know, some dynamics that continue to evolve, and we're gaining more experience in insight as we work through this. We're planning for solid revenue and profit growth in the near-term. We've got the same long-term outlook for our business. We see the same potential, and I think the strength of the business during the pandemic's reinforcing that potential. So, we're feeling good about the business, but we'd like to gain more experience with some of the dynamics before we start updating the specific projections.\nMichael Ryskin: Appreciate the color. A quick follow-up exactly on that [poll], the strength in June, July, and you had some comments of, you expect that some of this could have been pent-up demand from April, you know, from late March, April downturn. Any color, you could give us any way to parse that apart? Because obviously, you know, the 30%, recurring CAG in June is clearly above any prior level of performance. So, anything you do to sort of give us a sense of what the underlying demand levels are right now?\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. I mean, we do think as we indicated that some of this is due to pent-up demand, both from the wellness and non-wellness side. I mean, we also think that there's a potential change in the delivery of care, which is both driving visits to the practice and in higher diagnostics. And let me just expand on that through the lens of both the pet owner and the veterinarian.  So, if you if you think about the pet owner ,we\u2019re all spending significantly more time with our pets as we work from home. We're observing more issues, you know, could be very simple things like limping, scratching, lesions. So, I think being more attuned to our pet and their activities, certainly, pet owners are bringing their pets to the practices both catch up, as well as observing new things. And then from the [indiscernible] dimension, we believe that if anything COVID-19 has continued to support and potentially accelerated the focus of medical services, now part of that may be to, due to, they've seen product sales, move to e-retailers as practices were close, or access, you know, somewhat restricted. And when you focus on medical services, as I indicated, to treat you first have to diagnose, and so diagnostics plays a really key role there. We've also heard from veterinarians that they are recommending in some cases a higher standard of care when the owners dropping off the pet at the curbside. Some of the uncomfort or discomfort of the face-to-face conversations are easier to happen when you're talking to the pet owner remotely. And there may be some factors related to just that awareness of the need to provide a full care, if there's a second way or there's a recession down the road, so in the pets and the practice taking care of the pet to the full extent possible. So, all these things are playing in, and we'll have to see over time how they play out.\nMichael Ryskin: Yeah, [indiscernible].\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. Mike, I think there's clearly some recent benefit from the pent-up demand, but the underlying market demand across our regions look solid. So, we're obviously monitoring that, but we feel very good about the underlying trends.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from Mr. Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Nick [indiscernible] in for Ryan. I guess just to start off, there's been a lot of talk and data out there about how new puppies have been growing, people have been going to adopt new pets, because their working at home. I was just wondering, would you kind of define that more as being a pull forward? I.e. like people were planning on getting pets originally, and just now they're working from home, they just thought that this was a good time, or do you view it more as an incremental increase in pet ownership?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, so we haven't seen hard data out there that quantifies the dynamic between adoptions and fostering. And you have to factor in all the puts and takes, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that was just, you know, adoptions from breeders, as well as fostering is up. And we've seen a number of different reports looking at the different dimensions of drivers. So, you know, I think it's reasonable to assume there is benefit from that, but over time, we'll watch some better data behind that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. [Indiscernible] And then I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the decline in rapid assays this month. I wonder if there's any logic to why consumables would, you know, grow pretty healthily, but rapid assays decline or was that just like a function of a strong comp from last year?\nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, there were a couple of things. We're pleased with the Rapid Assay business and the progress we continue to make in the assay business. Revenues did decline 5% organically in Q2 is primarily related to two things. One is, we were relatively more impacted in the early quarter piece of the pandemic impacted volume pressures. Keep in mind, a good portion of our Rapid Assay business is 4Dx and heartworm, which is more of a screening test. And the pandemic occurred right smack in the middle of a peak season. So clearly that was impacted. And then there were some year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing activity. In 2019, we had a two decent sized promotionals. So the compare was a bit more challenging. We don't believe it's a competitive issue when you take a look at a couple things; one is, unique customers and new unique customers were modestly above where we were. So, we're happy with the way the business is progressing. And then if you take a look more at the sick patient testing piece of the portfolio, so these are [indiscernible] like Parvo and Giardia, as well as CPL and FPL, you know, those were pretty healthy. So, we've pretty much pinpointed it to both the promotional compare, as well as where the pandemic fell, relative to the peak season.\nBrian McKeon : And as I highlighted the, in June it was up 30%. So, we're the same kind of [indiscernible] we've seen in other parts of the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Great. That\u2019s very helpful guys. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Jay, maybe to start, you know, on the outlook, you obviously highlighted the strong visit growth continuing into July, you know, the proportion of visits that include diagnostic, you know, continues to go up, and that's kind of been a longer-term trend. You know, I think kind of going into the year, you know, you guys had kind of expected, you know, 11% to 12%, kind of CAG Dx recurring growth. I guess, if we see these end-market trends continue, and obviously, there's some uncertainty around that. I mean, is that the type of revenue run rate that we should expect the business to get back to over the back half of the year assuming that these market trends hold?\nJay Mazelsky : Yeah. As Brian said, we\u2019re very encouraged by the strong recovery, you know, in the market, in business, and we think we're properly and appropriately positioning ourselves to be able to support that. And solid business growth as that develops, whether it's service levels or commercial capability, but, you know, they've given that the environment is still very dynamic, and it's challenging to project. You know, I'm just not going to go down the path of hypothesizing what that looks like. It's hard to predict what the future, you know, these type of COVID related restrictions are going to look like and how they play out. You know, though, as I said, we're very positive. I think we're very optimistic on the outlook and the resilience of the marketplace, but we\u2019ll have to see how all the puts and takes play out.\nBrian McKeon: I think as \u2013 it's early, but I think it\u2019s a longer-term trend. Some of the themes that Jay was reinforcing on the increased emphasis on services and comfort level with recommending more diagnostics we certainly think that that can be a positive factor for us, but, you know, in terms of our new to moderate-term outlook, I think there are a number of variables that we're gaining more experience with and we're planning for solid growth. That's our outlook.\nNathan Rich: That's fair. And that kind of dovetails into my second question, the stat that you gave around kind of diagnostic revenue per visit up 5% year to date, obviously, kind of very good considering the backdrop, I guess, have you seen this accelerate at all, you know, as you know, COVID hit and, you know, is this a longer term, potentially tail that could be, you know, beneficial to the business, you know, kind of coming out of COVID?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, so, you know, whenever veterinarians focus on medical services, we benefit from a diagnostic standpoint, and it drives to care envelope and they need to be able to characterize the condition of the patient to be able to treat the patient. And the only way or the best way that they do that is through diagnostic testing. So, that's certainly a very positive factor. The other positive factor is more in our control, and that\u2019s through innovation. As we continue to expand our menu, as we continue to expand the solutions and tools that we provide veterinarians, they test more. And then the third factor is obviously, creating awareness, education, and ultimately, more testing, and that's done through our field organization, our both professional service vets, as well as our account managers to VDCs. So, all those things come into play. I think it's a very positive story, in terms of, you know, those factors driving this engine of growth and diagnostics.\nNathan Rich : Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question in the line comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning, sort of a long first question, but over the past two to three years, IDEXX\u2019s CAG recurring growth premium has been about a thousand basis points to same store clinical visits. Let me see if I can make sense here. You know, for June, the premium was massive. It was on 2,300 basis points to 30% that you guys allude to in the release versus June up 7%. You guys in the release, and I think on the call talked about July same-store clinical visits up 6%, but how about the CAG recurring? I'm just curious if that massive CAG recurring premium remained elevated, you know and very wide and over 20% or did it start to tighten guys back to the historical, which is sort of closer to that 10% delta? Hopefully that made some sense.\nBrian McKeon : Yeah, Jon. I wanted to focus on the on the Q2 dynamic, but to your point, we we've typically grown at a very healthy premium. We look at it a few different ways, whether it be to clinical visits or things like PCE growth. And I think that even with the dynamics that went on earlier in the quarter the actual gap widened in Q2 versus historical levels somewhat. And so, we think that's very encouraging. We think it reinforces the themes that Jay was talking about, which is emphasis on services and some positive dynamics that may help us going forward.  We're not in a position to project our monthly revenues. What I would say is that, you know, the strong clinical visit trends that we're reinforcing and seeing globally, by the way, are indicative of solid momentum in our business overall. So, it's a, you know, it's a positive dynamic. We feel very good about that and look forward to building on those trends going forward.\nJon Block : Okay, I think [to try to push you] a little bit Brian. I guess what I'm curious about is, you know for the overall quarter, I believe according to my math, the average premium wasn't too dissimilar than years past. It was around a thousand bips, but it was crazy, right. In April, the CAG recurring was down 16%, and so was the visit. So the premium was zero in the beginning of the quarter in April, and then 2,300 basis points as you exited in June, and I'm just trying to get a feel, you know, on a month by month basis, that it's a very big move. So as we went into July, I mean clearly you have the data, was it, you know, elevated at that 2,300? Or did it start to work its way and compress a little bit? That's just sort of what I'm trying to get at.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah, no, look, I think we're going to learn more as we go forward. We think we're \u2013 we obviously were surprised this was better than we expected. We knew it was a resilient business and thought we would recover quickly, but I think this has come back even stronger than we thought, and you know, we'll see how this plays out over time. There's a lot of dynamics going on in the near-term, there is some pent-up demand effect that that's going on, and perhaps some changes the way vets are delivering services that Jay highlighted. So, we'll learn more.\nJon Block: Okay. And the second question is a little bit different, but hey, you know, you talked about some of the stuff we recently called out in our checks with work from home, resulting in pet owners to see more stuff for perceived issues and bringing their dogs and cats in the vet's office and, you know, as a result, they're running diagnostics. I mean, you also talked about curbside, you know, vets are uncomfortable selling so curbside just easier for them to push diagnostics, but, you know, those are arguably I think we all hope in some way are temporary and you know, when work from home eases, who knows, but going into 2021 and we're never going to remain curbside right? Hopefully people are going to go back into the best practice. How does that unfold? I guess what I'm trying to get at are these structural long-term changes in terms of tailwinds for diagnostics or do you see some of those benefits that you\u2019ve alluded to arguably unwinding over the next handful of months? Thanks, guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. I would just add a couple of observations. One, as I think as veterinarians recommend, let's say more of a full service approach, and pet owners are supportive of that. They often \u2013 that often go through a change themselves and say, okay, I've asked the pet owner for it, I thought they were kind of push back or maybe more budget minded than they were and in fact, they've been very receptive to us. So, I think what we often say and we see this in preventive care program is the whole process of helping the tenant or through that change management piece of bringing the pet in, and having this check that includes diagnostics is important both for the pet owner, as well as the veterinarian, and then, you know, the other thing that I would height, heighten or at least highlight is that, whatever the long-term citing or, you know whether people stay at home or if it's more of a hybrid type model or employees come back to work. You know, I think most experts who are looking at this believe that there will be more of a hybrid model where you have a combination of employees working from home and work. And I think that if anything, there will be, you know, that continued visibility to the pet health and strengthening of the human pet bond, which is, I think, good for the industry.\nJon Block : Great, thanks Jay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from David Westenberg from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, and thank you for taking my question. I think investors have a pretty good sense of what's going on in the U.S. just getting the third party data, but I think Europe seems to be kind of a black box for a lot of investors. And, you know, you're a global company. So, I was hoping maybe you can just talk about European macro. And then you could probably use U.S. as kind of a benchmark in terms of what\u2019s relative to the U.S. because that is a question we get a lot and something that's pretty hard for us to understand in terms of macro and recovery.\nBrian McKeon: Sure. So just stepping back our CAG recurring Dx numbers, as we mentioned were up similar rates 7%, both in U.S. and internationally. Europe has, I think, overall seen similar strong recovery trends. I think there are some specific market dynamics. We've seen consistent, very solid growth in areas like Germany and in Southern Europe, particularly recovering from some of the significant lockdown or the fact that were seen in March and April. The UK lagged, that just having lockdown procedures in place for a longer period. And we noted that in terms of the lab growth was relatively lower than the U.S. but I think overall very similar dynamics V-shaped recovery, that clinics back online, very positive feedback on demand. And, you know, a little a little kind of an evolution of some of the markets, but as we as we speak, basically all the markets are back online. And, you know, we're feeling good about the growth outlook in that context.\nDavid Westenberg: Got you. And then maybe I'm jumping in front of your Analyst Day here, can you talk about contribution from maybe psychology and contribution from Bile Acids that the new product launches and where it's gone in growth maybe right now and where we anticipated growth in the future. I do know you give a similar kind of graph to that in your Analyst Day. So, if I ended up in front of that my apologies there and we can wait for a month for that.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, no, I'll just give you a quick, quick update and flavor of the two, two products you mentioned. You know, we're \u2013 as I had indicated, we're really pleased with the market reception to digital cytology. You know, we think that being able to provide the cytology services in under 2 hours, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, is truly transformational. We think if I just characterize the U.S. market, we're primarily targeting the higher cytology users. So these are customers who submit five plus cytology exams, you know, the experts, the pathology experts like we have, and we think that that represents about 5% of the overall marketplace. Just to give you another data point, we have about 6,000 customers, IDEXX customers who use our reference labs and also use our cytology services. So, we think that there's a pretty decent sized opportunity out there, that's going to take some time to develop, but you know, so far so good in terms of customer enthusiasm and market reception to the service. In terms of the Bile Acids question, the way we think about it is, each parameter that we introduce is important. It has a lot of value to customers, but it's the cumulative menu that I think has the most impact. In the case of catalysts, this is now our, a test. The one previous to that was progesterone. So it's being able to provide a menu where you don't need to have a new or separate instrument that it fits within the workflow and use model of, you know, our chemistry analyzer is really important. The particular test [requested] Bile Acids is very accurate as reference lab quality performance. And we were very pleased with the rate of adoption and the rate of awareness amongst our customer base, given that it's only been really a couple months, and we're in the middle of a pandemic, so that type of uptake is quite gratifying.\nDavid Westenberg : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from Andrew Cooper from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Cooper: Hey, thanks for the time. I guess starting with, maybe the P&L a little bit, you know, obviously, kind of an odd quarter with COVID, but good results, but as we look at the gross margin line, you know, is there anything you'd call out, obviously, you know, there's some costs that came out, you've got, you know, kind of a slew of things across gross margin and OpEx that you talked about, but is there anything in particular to call out on the gross margin line, in terms of, you know, really a very strong number, I think, the strongest we've maybe ever seen from you guys, so anything to point out there?\nBrian McKeon : A big part of that is mix. So, you know, just the strength of CAG recurring Dx and at the same time declines in the instrument revenues. So, you know that is definitely a factor in terms of the absolute number. We did benefit from cost control. So, we in late March, early April, when we saw the initial COVID impacts, we were very focused on making sure we can manage through that effectively. We were very tight on hiring and staffing. We ensured we had good service delivery, but that was a benefit as well. So, as we move forward, I think we \u2013 as we noted, we're going to be adding resources to make sure that we can support staffing. We're seeing some higher freight distribution costs, which I think is a broader kind of macro dynamic that's going on. And importantly, we'll have the German core lab coming online. So, we'll have some incremental costs there. So, that\u2019ll be \u2013 have some moderating effects, but you know, we're very pleased with the gross margin results. And it really reflects the health and kind of the high margin flow through of the recurring annuity of the IDEXX business.\nAndrew Cooper: Okay, great. And maybe just kind of a similar question on OpEx, obviously, you know, the 13 million coming back, you know, presumably at some point, the benefits cost in terms of dental and health care, you talked at, talked about at least normalizing, but you know, as we think at a high level, you know, about how COVID has changed how we behave, you know, you mentioned doing installations, remote and things like that, does this change how you think about some of those, you know, some of those line items on a more permanent basis in terms of, you know, real cost savings that you could drive, either, you know, that you hadn't thought of before, or potentially, I guess, just faster than maybe you would have planned otherwise, in terms of, you know, the overall sort of cost basis?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, I mean, I think it has opened up everybody's eyes in different industries to things you can do more productively, or different. I think some of the examples we cited, like being able to firstly to partner with customers, whether it's through a sales process or remote installation, providing software tools, which allow them to do telehealth visits. You know, I think these things are certainly areas of focus that we can look at that will drive productivity. I think having a larger workforce without needing bricks and mortar, and being able to support remote employees, you know, in a productive fashion, I think, we're all finding that there's some, you know, that there's some benefits in doing that. I wouldn't quantify it at this point in terms of operating expense savings, but I work constantly as business leaders looking at how we can run the business differently and more productively while still supporting our customers.\nAndrew Cooper: Okay, great, and maybe one more kind of asking a question a different way than it's been asked so far, but when we think about that pent-up demand and backlog, do you have a sense for, you know, hey, it feels like a lot of what's come out, we've worked our way through and now all the visits that are being seen are kind of more on the steady run rate, or is there still some of that that pent up demand that you're feeling, you know, early in July, that potentially is whether it's elevated visits, you know, visit numbers themselves are elevated utilization within visits, because it's maybe been longer, you know, since that pet was last in the clinic, is there anything you can kind of point us to, you know to give us a little bit of a level set for where we sit, you know, entering July and into 3Q?\nBrian McKeon : I think there is, you know, still some pent-up demand effects going on. You could see that in the wellness visit growth, it was up 10% through the first three weeks. So, I think that is supporting that. And, you know, it's tough to calibrate. We grew 7% in Q2 that's, you know, below what we had normally grown. So, you know, that would indicate that we didn't make up some of the visits and so, you know, we're not in position yet to say what's, you know, where's this settling out if you will. You know, I think the underlying factors all look very positive. The industry looks healthy. Vet clinics are online. They're doing more service based work. Anecdotally, the feedback has all been really good and I think we're just, you know, seeing factors that reinforce the strong pet owner bond and willingness to spend on pets. So, you know, we're likely seeing some continued pent-up demand benefit, but I think the underlying trends look very, very healthy.\nAndrew Cooper: Great, I'll stop there. Appreciate the time.\nBrian McKeon : Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. I want to, with that\u2026\nBrian McKeon : We were going to transition to conclude the call.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business while still delivering the day. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. We look forward to meeting many virtually as part of our Investor Day program. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter. We benefited from a V-shaped recovery and our CAG business and flow through profit benefits from favorable product mix and discipline cost controls. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 3% as reported and 4% organically supported by 7% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Following a period of significant pressure on CAG diagnostic testing volumes in late March through mid-April, we saw a sharp recovery in market demand for diagnostics globally in the second quarter, including very high growth levels in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness and non-wellness testing. Better than expected CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth and benefits from proactive cost controls drove a 410 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. This enabled delivery of $1.72 in early earnings per share, an increase of 23% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the first half of 2020, we delivered an EPS of $3.01, up 18% on a comparable constant currency basis despite headwinds related to the COVID pandemic. As we'll discuss solid pet healthcare market growth trends have continued in July, pointing to a foundation for continued solid revenue growth for our core CAG business. We're also well-positioned in terms of our financial management approach, aligned with our goal to deliver operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth in the second half of 2020. While we're very encouraged by recent market trends and our ability to manage through the COVID pandemic effectively, we recognize the potential future effects related to the pandemic may be dynamic and challenging to project. As such, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 at this time. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 4% was driven by 7% organic gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets. Our overall revenue growth also benefited by 1% from our OPTI human PCR test initiative. These gains offset impacts related to the pandemic, which reduced new IDEXX VetLab and digital instrument placements, and pressured non-compliance water testing. We also saw impacts from the reversal of March stocking orders and our water and LPD businesses, which reduced Q2 revenues by 4.5 million or less than 1%. As noted, our overall performance was driven by growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, which strengthened considerably through Q2. By month, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues declined approximately 16% in April, increased 8% in May, and grew an impressive 30% in June, supported by strong gains across our major modalities. Consistent solid revenue trends were seen across our major regions, reflecting the global strength and resilience of the veterinary healthcare market. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by a rebound in clinical visits as demonstrated in our same store U.S. weekly tracking data, published in our earnings snapshot available on our website. Following an 18% contraction in clinical visits in April, same-store clinical visits amounted to plus 2% in May and plus 7% in June, resulting in a 3% overall decline for the quarter. Early quarter pressure on testing was greater in wellness visits, which were down 5% for the quarter overall, but rebounded strongly in May and June. Non-wellness visits which we estimate drive about 75% of U.S. diagnostics revenue were down only 1% on the same basis in Q2. Clinical visit activity outpaced overall vet practice visit activity in the second quarter, as business mix of veterinary clinics has shifted towards more service based offerings. These dynamics supported a solid 2.5% increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2, despite a 5% decline in overall visits to clinics in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the broad market recovery. These solid trends have continued in July reflected in gains of 6%, and U.S. same store clinical visits through the first three weeks ended July 17, with solid growth now reflected across major U.S. regions. Please note that there is some latency in the reporting in the most recent weekly data, with these metrics continuing to improve as additional visit data is added over time. We believe the health and resilience of the global pet healthcare market is a positive factor that can support continued solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. These improved market trends supported a strong recovery in IDEXX revenues in the quarter. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 7% in Q2, reflecting 6% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions offset by a 1% FX headwind. Results reflected high single digit gains in the U.S. and modest overall organic growth in international markets as strong gains in key regions like Germany, Japan, and Australia were offset by lockdown related impacts in the UK and Canada. IDEXX vet lab consumable revenues increased an impressive 13% on an organic basis despite early quarter pandemic related impacts, reflecting low-to-mid teen growth in both U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium installed base. As expected, CAG instrument placements were constrained in Q2 impacted by restrictions on sales access to veterinary clinics, and deferrals of new purchase decisions. This contributed to a 19 million or 40% year-on-year decline in reporting CAG instrument revenue in the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high reflected in 165 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, and 536 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 231 second catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 16% year-on-year growth and our global catalyst installed base. We also achieved 545 premium hematology placements in 275 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9,500 instruments, up 25% year-on-year. As Jay will discuss our field sales forces, we'd focus on rebuilding the new instrument pipeline globally as we gradually gain increased access to vet clinics. Rapid Assay revenues decreased 5% organically in Q2; primarily reflecting early quarter pandemic related volume pressure, as well as year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing and activity. Consistent with our overall trends, Rapid Assay revenues showed a strong rebound from nearly 40% year-on-year revenue declines in April to nearly 30% year-on-your gains in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues declined 3% organically overall. Double digit gains and recurring service revenues were offset by declines in new veterinary software and diagnostic imaging system placements, reflecting pandemic related constraints on new sales activities. Turning to our other business segments following a 16% organic gain in our water business in Q1, we saw a 16% organic growth revenue decline in Q2. Second quarter results were impacted by the reversal of 2 million of accelerated stocking orders, reducing organic growth by 7%. The vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service, albeit with some disruption in early Q2 related to business lockdown effects, as well as beach and pool closures. Approximately 20% of our water revenues are from non-compliance testing related to areas like special projects, construction, and real estate transactions. We saw a greater than expected decline in this area related to reduced overall business activity and prioritization of lab spending. While we saw improvement in water revenue trends as we work through the quarter, we anticipate that non-compliance testing demand will be uneven in the near to moderate term, as public and private testing labs and public utilities adapt to pandemic related macro impacts. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 2% overall in Q2, net of an estimated 2.5 million or 8% headwind related to the reversal of accelerated stocking orders. LPD results continue to benefit from a demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever, an improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We're also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally.  Overall, LPD gains were moderated in Q2 as expected by lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of bovine herd populations in key Asia Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Finally, as noted, IDEXX overall growth in Q2 benefited by approximately 1% from revenues associated with our [OPTI] and COVID-19 PCR test. This includes benefits from our initial test supply program with the state of Maine. We're extending these support efforts through the implementation of a lab based testing capability in partnership with the Maine CDC that will provide capacity for up to 350,000 human COVID tests over the next several months. We're continuing to focus on supporting COVID PCR testing globally leveraging the capabilities of our OPTI human and LPD businesses. We note that human PCR testing is a very dynamic area with shorter-term project commitments, and growing competition from alternative suppliers that make demand difficult to project. In addition to these efforts, we recently completed work to adapt our OPTI PCR test for use in wastewater samples, which will be offered to IDEXX water customers through our water commercial organization. We're very pleased to be leveraging the capability of IDEXX to contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Turning to the P&L, profit results were very strong in Q2 benefiting from solid revenue gains favorable product mix, and proactive steps to manage costs in the context of the pandemic. These actions supported 380 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 410 basis points on a constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 18% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $1.72 per share, including benefits of 4.9 million or $0.06 per share related to share based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 23%. Gross profit increased 6% as reported or 8% on a constant currency basis in Q2. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a constant currency basis supported by net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues, benefits from moderate net price gains, and solid productivity improvement in our lab operations supported by tight cost controls. In the second half of 2020, we'll see relative increases in our reference lab costs reflecting the on-boarding of our new German core laboratory. And as we add lab staffing to ensure high customer service levels globally in a growing market. Operating expenses in Q2 decreased 4% as reported and 2% on a constant currency basis. As noted on our last call, we advanced a targeted 25 million of quarterly operating expense reductions, compared to our original spending plans to mitigate potential impacts from the pandemic.  Benefits from these initiatives, as well as approximately $5 million in lower than expected health and dental costs were realized in the quarter. These efficiencies in combination with stronger than expected revenue growth enabled 200 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Given the strong recovery in our business, we've discontinued temporary salary and benefit reductions, which yielded an estimated 13 million in savings in the second quarter. In the second half of 2020, we intend to advance targeted hiring and prioritize investments in supportive or long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability while delivering solid operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth. In terms of cash flow, we generated 236 million in positive cash flow year-to-date. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 80% or 93% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarters expansion, and German lab relocation, which are now largely complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position enhanced by steps in Q2 to add to our liquidity and flexibility. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.26 times net of cash with 105 million in cash and 877 million in capacity available on our expanded $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter and it contend to continue prioritizing funding of our growth strategy and business operations this year. Overall, we're very pleased with strong momentum and level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q2. IDEXX is a great business model with tremendous long-term potential. We're very pleased to have managed through the first half of 2020 effectively, despite the pandemic impacts, and look forward to building on that progress. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Well, as you know, I think we're very encouraged by the trends in the business and our execution. The decision to continue to suspend guidance is not reflective of a lack of optimism for the business. I think it's more just reflective of its \u2013 continues to be a dynamic. You can see 30% growth in the business in June, you know, we have, you know, some dynamics that continue to evolve, and we're gaining more experience in insight as we work through this. We're planning for solid revenue and profit growth in the near-term. We've got the same long-term outlook for our business. We see the same potential, and I think the strength of the business during the pandemic's reinforcing that potential. So, we're feeling good about the business, but we'd like to gain more experience with some of the dynamics before we start updating the specific projections. Yeah. Mike, I think there's clearly some recent benefit from the pent-up demand, but the underlying market demand across our regions look solid. So, we're obviously monitoring that, but we feel very good about the underlying trends. And as I highlighted the, in June it was up 30%. So, we're the same kind of [indiscernible] we've seen in other parts of the business. I think as \u2013 it's early, but I think it's a longer-term trend. Some of the themes that Jay was reinforcing on the increased emphasis on services and comfort level with recommending more diagnostics we certainly think that that can be a positive factor for us, but, you know, in terms of our new to moderate-term outlook, I think there are a number of variables that we're gaining more experience with and we're planning for solid growth. That's our outlook. Yeah, Jon. I wanted to focus on the on the Q2 dynamic, but to your point, we we've typically grown at a very healthy premium. We look at it a few different ways, whether it be to clinical visits or things like PCE growth. And I think that even with the dynamics that went on earlier in the quarter the actual gap widened in Q2 versus historical levels somewhat. And so, we think that's very encouraging. We think it reinforces the themes that Jay was talking about, which is emphasis on services and some positive dynamics that may help us going forward.  We're not in a position to project our monthly revenues. What I would say is that, you know, the strong clinical visit trends that we're reinforcing and seeing globally, by the way, are indicative of solid momentum in our business overall. So, it's a, you know, it's a positive dynamic. We feel very good about that and look forward to building on those trends going forward. Yeah, no, look, I think we're going to learn more as we go forward. We think we're \u2013 we obviously were surprised this was better than we expected. We knew it was a resilient business and thought we would recover quickly, but I think this has come back even stronger than we thought, and you know, we'll see how this plays out over time. There's a lot of dynamics going on in the near-term, there is some pent-up demand effect that that's going on, and perhaps some changes the way vets are delivering services that Jay highlighted. So, we'll learn more. Sure. So just stepping back our CAG recurring Dx numbers, as we mentioned were up similar rates 7%, both in U.S. and internationally. Europe has, I think, overall seen similar strong recovery trends. I think there are some specific market dynamics. We've seen consistent, very solid growth in areas like Germany and in Southern Europe, particularly recovering from some of the significant lockdown or the fact that were seen in March and April. The UK lagged, that just having lockdown procedures in place for a longer period. And we noted that in terms of the lab growth was relatively lower than the U.S. but I think overall very similar dynamics V-shaped recovery, that clinics back online, very positive feedback on demand. And, you know, a little a little kind of an evolution of some of the markets, but as we as we speak, basically all the markets are back online. And, you know, we're feeling good about the growth outlook in that context. A big part of that is mix. So, you know, just the strength of CAG recurring Dx and at the same time declines in the instrument revenues. So, you know that is definitely a factor in terms of the absolute number. We did benefit from cost control. So, we in late March, early April, when we saw the initial COVID impacts, we were very focused on making sure we can manage through that effectively. We were very tight on hiring and staffing. We ensured we had good service delivery, but that was a benefit as well. So, as we move forward, I think we \u2013 as we noted, we're going to be adding resources to make sure that we can support staffing. We're seeing some higher freight distribution costs, which I think is a broader kind of macro dynamic that's going on. And importantly, we'll have the German core lab coming online. So, we'll have some incremental costs there. So, that'll be \u2013 have some moderating effects, but you know, we're very pleased with the gross margin results. And it really reflects the health and kind of the high margin flow through of the recurring annuity of the IDEXX business. I think there is, you know, still some pent-up demand effects going on. You could see that in the wellness visit growth, it was up 10% through the first three weeks. So, I think that is supporting that. And, you know, it's tough to calibrate. We grew 7% in Q2 that's, you know, below what we had normally grown. So, you know, that would indicate that we didn't make up some of the visits and so, you know, we're not in position yet to say what's, you know, where's this settling out if you will. You know, I think the underlying factors all look very positive. The industry looks healthy. Vet clinics are online. They're doing more service based work. Anecdotally, the feedback has all been really good and I think we're just, you know, seeing factors that reinforce the strong pet owner bond and willingness to spend on pets. So, you know, we're likely seeing some continued pent-up demand benefit, but I think the underlying trends look very, very healthy. Thank you. We were going to transition to conclude the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Today, we're pleased to report excellent Q2 results supported by a sharp global recovery in the pet healthcare market. As Brian noted in Q2, we delivered 4% overall organic growth and a 7% increase in CAG diagnostics recurring revenues, despite significant early quarter headwinds related to stay at home policies. We've managed well the initial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we've seen a strong and sustained recovery in our core companion animal health business that is highly encouraging and reinforces our optimism and the long-term growth potential of our business. Proactive cost discipline allowed us to deliver strong profit gains, while ensuring ongoing investment in our innovation programs, a high level of continued service for our customers, and investments in the health and safety of our employees. This strong level of performance reflects IDEXX's extraordinary resilience. It gives us confidence in our ability to sustain solid growth and financial results as we manage through the ongoing dynamics associated with the pandemic. Let me start with a brief update on our supply chain performance, market trends, observations on how our customers are adapting, and the success of our commercial organization and engaging customers to support the recovery of the market. IDEXX has applied veterinary practices in an uninterrupted fashion with point-of-care diagnostic products and services like reference lab testing, and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future.  Our manufacturing operations which are largely based in the U.S. have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our reference lab performance has also been especially noteworthy, in light of disrupted in challenging logistics more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employees safe. Our network lab capability enables us to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption in the event of a COVID-19 infection. These capabilities are possible through significant investments that have been made over a long period of time, in lab density, common lab information management systems, and courier route of logistics capability. Not having to worry about service or product availability, our customers have been able to focus on their mission of caring for patients and have been highly resilient through the pandemic. They have now expanded the breadth of services provided from the early COVID-19 focus on sick and emergency patient services.  As Brian noted, despite an overall 5% decline in the same practice visit levels and Q2, vet clinics were able to increase in-practice revenues by 2.5%, supported by an increased emphasis of medical services enabled by diagnostics testing. Customers have adapted to new ways of delivering service, such as an increased use of telehealth and curbside checking where the pet owner remains in a car during the appointment. Staff from veterinary clinics have indicated that this has increased their comfort level with recommending more comprehensive and clinically relevant diagnostics with support from pet owners. Veterinarian's also say that they are increasingly focused on delivering core medical services for their patients, as a result of the substitution of product sales to e-retailers, which have accelerated. To treat, veterinarians have to first diagnose and IDEXX's proprietary diagnostics are a key tool in advancing the standard of care. Supported by these trends, we've seen solid improvement in both wellness and non-wellness visits with additional acceleration of wellness visits more recently reflecting in-part pent-up demand. The proportion of clinical visits, including at least one diagnostic has increased since March in both wellness and-non wellness visits. In addition, we're seeing greater dollars of diagnostic revenue per clinical visit. Overall, the average diagnostic revenue per clinical visit in 2020 that included at least one diagnostic has been trending above previous years levels as well, approximately 5% higher for the first half of 2020 versus the first half of 2019. In fact, diagnostics revenue per critical visit overall, and per non-wellness visit has been higher than in 2019 every month this year. We're also seeing evidence of increased interest in pivot ownership through the pandemic, including among current pet owners, another indication of the strengthening of the pet human bond. These improvement trends are global and have sustained in early Q3, as evidenced by continued solid U.S. clinical growth trends, albeit at moderated levels from the extraordinary growth rates seen in June. We are monitoring the evolution of the pandemic and associated management of infection rate growth across regions, which may impact future demand. We remain encouraged by the solid global recovery in demand in our core CAG business supported by an ever growing pet owner bond. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. We're very pleased with the effectiveness of our global commercial team during a period with a very challenging market backdrop. Field occupancy remains in the high 90s and customers appreciate that the cadence and level of our field visits, whether they are physical or virtual in nature are at very high levels. Our global teams also showed tremendous agility in supporting our customers during this period, including designing and implementing a new remote instrument install and training process, which enabled us to successfully onboard new customers in a safe and effective way when requested. Some of these new processes enabled us to place over 1,800 premium instruments globally in a quarter, including over 1,000 catalyst placements, with over 700 in new and competitive accounts. Our field service representatives continue to be welcomed by veterinary practices, and we've seen an increase in in-person visits by our customer account managers up to 40% in June, versus the 25% we saw in April for the U.S. While pandemic related factors have constrained CAG instrument placements, as well as new software system implementations and pressure new digital imaging system sales, we expect the pace of capital placements to gradually improve over the balance of the year. Our field teams have used this time to build pipelines in the rate in which this improvement occurs will be related to ongoing improvement to VDC access to veterinary practices and to hire practice owner confidence that will inevitably come with an economic recovery. As Brian noted, moving forward, we will be augmenting our commercial presence internationally. Our approach will be to add resources selectively on a rolling basis in targeted markets, leveraging the capabilities of our new global commercial model, which we look forward to discussing more at our upcoming Investor Day. We're encouraged by the resilience of the companion animal market, and believe there is a significant long-term opportunity to increase standards of care globally supported by our direct commercial capability. As we support customers, we're working to continue to advance programs that support a higher level of care, such as preventive care, we saw continued adoption of the IDEXX preventive care program with over 100 new enrollees in a quarter supported by the strong recovery and market demand for veterinary services and robust wellness visits traffic, bringing our total enrolled practice level to 4,300.  As expected, our Q2 additions were reduced from prior quarters as this is a program that requires broad practice access to onboard and train a large number of staff. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to uncover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care program is a key focus for our commercial team in the second half of the year in our recover together initiative. As we support continued market recovery, we also continue to advance our new product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. Through capital placements have experienced some near-term headwinds in the second quarter as a result of restricted practice access, digital cytology is experiencing strong customer interest. With our sophisticated information management systems and clinical pathology experts around the globe, we were able to provide results very often in well under the two hour commitment, allowing veterinarians to provide close to real time cytology professional services. Our technology for life philosophy, as represented by the introduction of Bile Acids in our IDEXX vet lab instrumentation suite has also been received with strong enthusiasm. Bile Acids reflects the eighth parameter introduced in catalyst over the last eight years. We are pleased with the breadth of global adoption to date as about a 1,000 customers across 35 countries have now utilized Bile Acids on catalyst with reference on a quality performance. As noted on the last call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April, and over 750 customers have now utilized the kit. Detecting bacteria in urine is a key driver of clinical value. And we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive an even greater appreciation for and testing with the SediVue platform. In addition to keeping innovations on track, as Brian discussed, we brought new COVID-19 test to market for both animals and people by leveraging core technical and manufacturing capability. We also continue to advance our operating capability. We're excited \u2013 very excited and have completed the move into our new European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. There are now houses over 500 employees with state of the art capabilities and automation.  Our Kornwestheim facility will enable us to further optimize our lab network in Europe, expand service levels and bring improved efficiency, while supporting our continued growth for years to come. Kornwestheim is now the largest lab in our global network. And the dedication and perseverance of our team made it possible to bring this lab online in the middle of a pandemic. Moving to our VSS business, although we face some headwinds related to new software and diagnostic imaging system placements as access to veterinary practices was impacted by COVID-19, we had excellent double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues, supported by the expansion of our customers subscription base for cloud solutions like Web PACS, SmartFlow, and Neo to highlight a few applications. We also saw hundreds of customers take advantage of integrated software solutions like secure remote access in telehealth that help practices, manage their business in this environment. We continue to strengthen our leadership and global execution and software, and are excited to announce the addition Michael Schreck as Corporate Vice President and General Manager, IDEXX veterinary software and services reporting to me. Michael has over 20 years of experience in industry leading software and technology. He has global responsibility for our customer facing software business, and will work closely with our global CAG commercial team to advanced software solutions to support more efficient workflows, and practice management, improved patient care, and value-added services that drive the overall health of veterinary practices. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities continue to be a top priority for us. Though we have begun to bring back a small number of employees engaged product development with their benefits on site access, the majority of IDEXX employees continued to work remotely, and travel remains highly restricted. We are providing spending allowance for many of our remote workers to help them maintain a health and safety work environment outside of our facilities. I'm especially appreciative of our employees around the world whose role required them to work on-site during these last several months, in order to provide essential services to our customers. Health and safety procedures continue to advance for on-site employees in addition to physical distancing and PPE now also include daily temperature checks in many locations.  Given improved market and business trends, we're happy to share that we've discontinued temporary reductions in employee salary and benefits. In light of the recovery in market demand, we are adding resources to critical areas like manufacturing and live operations to ensure we can support market demand and customer service levels moving forward. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Our 2020 media employee engagement survey showed an all-time high employee engagement level for the organization during a period in which a global pandemic has created significant business and personal challenges for our employees. Overall, we're very encouraged by the strong recovery in our business. The resilience of our industry and IDEXX's business in particular is extraordinary. We're positioning ourselves to support sustained market growth, while delivering solid financial performance as we continue to advance our long-term strategy. In this context, I would be remiss, if I didn't take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers. Our customers continue to provide medical services against the backdrop of economic uncertainties, and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. As many of us, including the pet owners, we couldn't be more appreciative. And a huge thank you to my IDEXX colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts in continuing to support these customers and our business. I'm very proud of what we accomplished this past quarter. In closing, we're looking forward to our first ever virtual Investor Day on Thursday, August 13. We will share updates on our long-term opportunity, strategic priorities, and financial goals. You can now register for the event on the investor relations section of our website. Participating in the event will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, CFO; Tina Hunt, General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Michael Lane, General Manager of Reference Labs and Information Technology; Jim Polewaczyk, the Chief Commercial Officer. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Sure. I mean, we do think as we indicated that some of this is due to pent-up demand, both from the wellness and non-wellness side. I mean, we also think that there's a potential change in the delivery of care, which is both driving visits to the practice and in higher diagnostics. And let me just expand on that through the lens of both the pet owner and the veterinarian.  So, if you if you think about the pet owner ,we're all spending significantly more time with our pets as we work from home. We're observing more issues, you know, could be very simple things like limping, scratching, lesions. So, I think being more attuned to our pet and their activities, certainly, pet owners are bringing their pets to the practices both catch up, as well as observing new things. And then from the [indiscernible] dimension, we believe that if anything COVID-19 has continued to support and potentially accelerated the focus of medical services, now part of that may be to, due to, they've seen product sales, move to e-retailers as practices were close, or access, you know, somewhat restricted. And when you focus on medical services, as I indicated, to treat you first have to diagnose, and so diagnostics plays a really key role there. We've also heard from veterinarians that they are recommending in some cases a higher standard of care when the owners dropping off the pet at the curbside. Some of the uncomfort or discomfort of the face-to-face conversations are easier to happen when you're talking to the pet owner remotely. And there may be some factors related to just that awareness of the need to provide a full care, if there's a second way or there's a recession down the road, so in the pets and the practice taking care of the pet to the full extent possible. So, all these things are playing in, and we'll have to see over time how they play out. Yeah, so we haven't seen hard data out there that quantifies the dynamic between adoptions and fostering. And you have to factor in all the puts and takes, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that was just, you know, adoptions from breeders, as well as fostering is up. And we've seen a number of different reports looking at the different dimensions of drivers. So, you know, I think it's reasonable to assume there is benefit from that, but over time, we'll watch some better data behind that. Yeah, there were a couple of things. We're pleased with the Rapid Assay business and the progress we continue to make in the assay business. Revenues did decline 5% organically in Q2 is primarily related to two things. One is, we were relatively more impacted in the early quarter piece of the pandemic impacted volume pressures. Keep in mind, a good portion of our Rapid Assay business is 4Dx and heartworm, which is more of a screening test. And the pandemic occurred right smack in the middle of a peak season. So clearly that was impacted. And then there were some year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing activity. In 2019, we had a two decent sized promotionals. So the compare was a bit more challenging. We don't believe it's a competitive issue when you take a look at a couple things; one is, unique customers and new unique customers were modestly above where we were. So, we're happy with the way the business is progressing. And then if you take a look more at the sick patient testing piece of the portfolio, so these are [indiscernible] like Parvo and Giardia, as well as CPL and FPL, you know, those were pretty healthy. So, we've pretty much pinpointed it to both the promotional compare, as well as where the pandemic fell, relative to the peak season. Yeah. As Brian said, we're very encouraged by the strong recovery, you know, in the market, in business, and we think we're properly and appropriately positioning ourselves to be able to support that. And solid business growth as that develops, whether it's service levels or commercial capability, but, you know, they've given that the environment is still very dynamic, and it's challenging to project. You know, I'm just not going to go down the path of hypothesizing what that looks like. It's hard to predict what the future, you know, these type of COVID related restrictions are going to look like and how they play out. You know, though, as I said, we're very positive. I think we're very optimistic on the outlook and the resilience of the marketplace, but we'll have to see how all the puts and takes play out. Yeah, so, you know, whenever veterinarians focus on medical services, we benefit from a diagnostic standpoint, and it drives to care envelope and they need to be able to characterize the condition of the patient to be able to treat the patient. And the only way or the best way that they do that is through diagnostic testing. So, that's certainly a very positive factor. The other positive factor is more in our control, and that's through innovation. As we continue to expand our menu, as we continue to expand the solutions and tools that we provide veterinarians, they test more. And then the third factor is obviously, creating awareness, education, and ultimately, more testing, and that's done through our field organization, our both professional service vets, as well as our account managers to VDCs. So, all those things come into play. I think it's a very positive story, in terms of, you know, those factors driving this engine of growth and diagnostics. Yeah. I would just add a couple of observations. One, as I think as veterinarians recommend, let's say more of a full service approach, and pet owners are supportive of that. They often \u2013 that often go through a change themselves and say, okay, I've asked the pet owner for it, I thought they were kind of push back or maybe more budget minded than they were and in fact, they've been very receptive to us. So, I think what we often say and we see this in preventive care program is the whole process of helping the tenant or through that change management piece of bringing the pet in, and having this check that includes diagnostics is important both for the pet owner, as well as the veterinarian, and then, you know, the other thing that I would height, heighten or at least highlight is that, whatever the long-term citing or, you know whether people stay at home or if it's more of a hybrid type model or employees come back to work. You know, I think most experts who are looking at this believe that there will be more of a hybrid model where you have a combination of employees working from home and work. And I think that if anything, there will be, you know, that continued visibility to the pet health and strengthening of the human pet bond, which is, I think, good for the industry. Yeah, no, I'll just give you a quick, quick update and flavor of the two, two products you mentioned. You know, we're \u2013 as I had indicated, we're really pleased with the market reception to digital cytology. You know, we think that being able to provide the cytology services in under 2 hours, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, is truly transformational. We think if I just characterize the U.S. market, we're primarily targeting the higher cytology users. So these are customers who submit five plus cytology exams, you know, the experts, the pathology experts like we have, and we think that that represents about 5% of the overall marketplace. Just to give you another data point, we have about 6,000 customers, IDEXX customers who use our reference labs and also use our cytology services. So, we think that there's a pretty decent sized opportunity out there, that's going to take some time to develop, but you know, so far so good in terms of customer enthusiasm and market reception to the service. In terms of the Bile Acids question, the way we think about it is, each parameter that we introduce is important. It has a lot of value to customers, but it's the cumulative menu that I think has the most impact. In the case of catalysts, this is now our, a test. The one previous to that was progesterone. So it's being able to provide a menu where you don't need to have a new or separate instrument that it fits within the workflow and use model of, you know, our chemistry analyzer is really important. The particular test [requested] Bile Acids is very accurate as reference lab quality performance. And we were very pleased with the rate of adoption and the rate of awareness amongst our customer base, given that it's only been really a couple months, and we're in the middle of a pandemic, so that type of uptake is quite gratifying. Yeah, I mean, I think it has opened up everybody's eyes in different industries to things you can do more productively, or different. I think some of the examples we cited, like being able to firstly to partner with customers, whether it's through a sales process or remote installation, providing software tools, which allow them to do telehealth visits. You know, I think these things are certainly areas of focus that we can look at that will drive productivity. I think having a larger workforce without needing bricks and mortar, and being able to support remote employees, you know, in a productive fashion, I think, we're all finding that there's some, you know, that there's some benefits in doing that. I wouldn't quantify it at this point in terms of operating expense savings, but I work constantly as business leaders looking at how we can run the business differently and more productively while still supporting our customers. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business while still delivering the day. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. We look forward to meeting many virtually as part of our Investor Day program. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

So, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take our -- take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Mazelsky.\nJay Mazelsky: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Today, we are pleased to report strong Q1 results, despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. As we will discuss, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our care customers in unusual ways, given broad based social distancing efforts, which are changing the ways veterinarians are prioritizing and providing care. We are working through these near-term dynamics, ensuring that we are fully supporting these essential health services in a way that prioritizes our customers\u2019 needs. We are doing this while we continue to advance our business strategy. Today, Brian will review our Q1 results and provide an update on current trends that we are seeing in our markets and our business. He will also describe the steps that were taken to mitigate near-term impacts and position ourselves for a strong and sustained recovery in the highly attractive pet health care market. I will then talk more about how we are seeing trends evolve in the market and how we are managing our business for the near-term and the long-term in this context. Now, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will be using a somewhat different format for today\u2019s financial review. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter financial results, which resulted in solid revenue and profit gains despite late quarter impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will then spend time discussing the near-term dynamics that we are seeing in the companion animal health care market, including evolving impacts from COVID-19 containment approaches on clinical visits and diagnostic testing levels. We will review how we plan to manage in this environment and highlight the steps we have taken to mitigate near-term P&L impacts and strengthen our balance sheet and flexibility to position our business for a strong recovery. While we are optimistic about the ability of the pet health care market and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular to rebound strongly from near-term COVID-19 effects we are withdrawing our full-year financial guidance as we work through these dynamics. As such, we won\u2019t be providing an update on that front today. Let\u2019s start with an overview of our Q1 results. IDEXX delivered 9% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, supported by 10% growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting double-digit gains across both U.S. and international markets, as well as solid gains in our Water and LPD businesses. Overall, organic revenue growth benefited by less than 1% from accelerated stocking orders in our Water and LPD businesses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending very strongly, above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were also tracking towards an excellent instrument placement quarter driven by continued momentum in new and competitive catalysts placements globally. These gains were against a backdrop of improved market trends, reflected in 4% same-store growth in U.S. clinical visits through this period. As social distancing policies advanced more broadly in Europe and the U.S. through March and as vet clinics adapted to prioritize health care procedures to align with industry and government guidelines, we saw significant declines in clinical visit activity and restriction on access to vet clinics, which moderated our Q1 revenue gains. Despite these impacts, our business momentum enabled strong overall Q1 organic revenue growth across our modalities. Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9%, reflecting 8% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions, offset by a 1% FX headwind. Through early March, Global Lab organic growth rates were excellent, driven by continued mid teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. and high single-digit gains in international markets. For Q1 overall, late quarter social distancing impacts constrained U.S. lab organic growth to high single-digit rates and international lab organic growth to the low-to-mid single-digit range. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% on an organic basis, despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts, reflecting low double-digit gains in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in international markets. Our consumable revenue growth results through early March were also very strong benefiting from an expanded premium instrument installed base, sustained high levels of customer retention and continued gains in testing utilization. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high in Q1 reflected in 238 catalysts placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 698 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 273 second catalyst placements driven by momentum with North American customers. These gains and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 17% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 760 premium hematology placements and 408 SediVue placements bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9300 instruments, up 32% year-on-year. Restriction on access to vet clinics in late March led to deferrals of quarter-end in placements, however, which contributed to year-on-year instrument organic revenue declines of 16% overall in the first quarter. Rapid Assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q1 despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts supported by solid volume growth in SNAP 4Dx Plus first-generation and specialty products and moderate net price gains. First quarter results reflected normal promotional and customer stocking activity, which supported volume gains ahead of the peak testing season. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues achieved 11% organic growth, supported by continued strong gains in recurring service revenues, as well as sustained solid sales of new Cornerstone and digital imaging systems, and strong growth in our Neo and SmartFlow cloud-based software offerings. Overall gains were also constrained by COVID-19 related impacts on vet clinics late in Q1, which led to a deferral of new software and digital system installations. Turning to our other business segments, we saw a strong performance in our Water and LPD businesses in Q1. Water revenues increased 15% organically, including an estimated $2 million or 8% growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Overall, our Water business demand has remained solid globally as drinking water testing remains an essential service and priority for local governments and utilities. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 12% organically in Q1, including approximately $3 million or 9% of growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. LPD results benefited for demand for -- from demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China. We are also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing. Overall LPD gains were constrained in Q1 by lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of herd populations in key Asia-Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Livestock diagnostics are also considered essential services supporting continued demand for LPD products. Turning to the P&L, profit results were strong in Q1 benefiting from solid revenue gains and controlled operating expense growth. Operating profit in Q1 increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid operating profit growth across our CAG Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased approximately 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting operating expense leverage on strong revenue gains. Gross profit increased 8% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis in Q1. Gross margins were relatively flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis, as benefits from strong Consumable and Water growth and continued moderate net price gains were offset by relatively lower margins in our Reference Lab business, reflecting late quarter pressure on lab revenues related to COVID-19 impacts, lab capacity investments advanced in 2019 and effects from the integration of the Marshfield acquisition. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis. Operating expense increases were driven by cost related to the expansion of our Global CAG commercial capability advanced in 2019 and growth in corporate, general, and administrative costs, including the on-boarding of our Westbrook Maine headquarters expansion. During the quarter, we benefited from early efforts to prioritize investments and controlled discretionary spending to mitigate emerging COVID-19 impacts. EPS in Q1 was a $1.29 per share including tax benefits of $6.6 million or $0.08 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 13%. Overall, we are pleased to have delivered strong financial results in Q1, despite late quarter headwinds related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let\u2019s now spend some time discussing how social distancing policies and associated restrictions on business activity are impacting veterinary clinic visits and our CAG business in the near-term. Clinical visits have been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of social distancing protocols, as well as the industry guidelines for the prioritization of sick patient and emergency procedures at vet clinics.  These dynamics can be seen in U.S. vet clinic tracking data, which is shown in the earnings snapshot on our IR website. We have added weekly tracking data for 2020 clinical visits extended through the week ended April 24th in the snapshot, as well as detail for wellness and non-wellness visits. As shown in this data, for the first quarter through early March on a same-store basis, clinical visits were up approximately 4% in the U.S., a solid improvement from 2019 trends. As social distancing procedures expanded in March, we saw a sharp correction in these trends, with same-store U.S. clinical visits declining approximately 25% for the weeks ended March 27th through April 10th with 15% to 20% year-on-year declines in sick patient visits and 35% to 40% declines in wellness visits during this period. We saw similar dynamics in European markets with more significant declines in severely impacted regions like Italy and Spain, as well as markets which implemented more restrictive stay-at-home policies like the U.K. In addition to this clinical visit data, we have been monitoring rolling weekly averages for chemistry slide run volumes and Rapid Assay runs through our global smart service connectivity, as well as rolling weekly trends for accession volumes in our Reference Labs. In the late March through the early to mid April period, we saw meaningful pressure on diagnostic testing levels associated with the restrictions on veterinary clinical activity. These initial impacts were relatively more significant in our Reference Lab and Rapid Assay businesses with average weekly volume declines of approximately 30% in the U.S. and approximately 35% in Europe during this period, with more moderate impacts in Asia-Pacific markets. Testing volume in these modalities were impacted in part by the de-emphasis of wellness testing at clinics as part of the pandemic response, consistent with industry guidelines. VetLab in clinic chemistry run volumes to relatively less effective during this initial period reflected an approximately 20% run declines in the U.S. and 25% declines in Europe. These metrics reflected lower test utilization levels, as well as moderate reduction in the number of clinics actively operating during this initial high impact period. Over the last two weeks, we have seen significant improvement in clinical visit and diagnostic testing trends. These changes reinforced the high resilience of demand for companion animal health care and may indicate that we work through the bottom of near-term COVID-19 effects on veterinary care. For the most recent week ended April 24th, overall U.S. clinical visits declines have moderated to 15% year-on-year with only 9% year-on-year declines for sick patient visits and 24% year-on-year declines for wellness visits, with steady improvement across U.S. regions week by week. We are seeing similar indications of improvement in European markets and in Asian regions which were impacted at an earlier stage by the pandemic. In terms of our business, we continue to see pressure on diagnostic testing levels. However, these impacts have improved meaningfully. In the U.S. and Europe on a rolling seven-day basis, IDEXX VetLab chemistry run declines have now moderated to approximately 5% year-on-year and Reference Lab accession volume declines have moderated to 10% to 15% overall, with continued steady weekly improvement across regions. Chemistry slide runs in leading-edge markets like China have actually returned to double-digit growth over the last eight weeks following the significant initial impacts on clinical activity. These changes vary by region may change depending on region specific dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall recent trends have been very encouraging. As we track data on COVID-19 related impacts over time, some insights are emerging. One insight is that most veterinary practices have sustained operations as an essential service through this initial high social distancing period positioning the market for a strong recovery. In the U.S., our tracking of the number of customers doing chemistry runs only declined to about 90% to 95% of prior year levels during the peak pressure period in early April and has now returned to prior levels over the last two weeks. Active customer tracking metrics have also rebounded strongly in Europe where we saw more meaningful reduction in active clinic levels earlier in the COVID-19 expansion in lockdown regions like Italy and Spain. We are seeing the same structural market strength in Asia-Pacific regions as well. The second insight is that the effects on diagnostic testing levels appear to be heavily influenced by the stage of development of COVID-19 case management and the associated stage of stay at home and social distancing procedures. There is a significant variation in the level of decline in diagnostic testing volumes by region. Regions with higher relative COVID-19 cases and expanded lockdown policies have experienced much more significant clinical visit and diagnostic testing volume declines. As an example, clinical visits in the Northeast U.S. declined approximately 35% in late March to mid April, while Southern U.S. regions decline approximately 20% during this period with more recent data from Southern U.S. region showing year-on-year declines of less than 10% overall. Internationally, near-term pressure and lab accession volumes in regions like Germany have been much more moderate compared to markets with extended lockdown conditions like the U.K. and Canada. In Asia-Pacific markets, we are also seeing moderated impact in regions that are farther along in terms of managing pandemic effects, including recent solid growth in the IDEXX Lab chemistry runs in markets like Australia, which has less restrictive social distancing controls. This is dynamic we will continue to monitor and which is challenging to predict. Overall, it does appear that as regions move past peak levels for COVID-19 cases and adjust stay at home and social distancing procedures, near-term pressures on clinical visit activity and related diagnostic testing lessen significantly. While we remain very optimistic about the health care market and IDEXX\u2019s ongoing growth opportunity reinforced by recent encouraging trends, COVID-19 pandemic effects will pressure our near-term revenue results. Given the high gross margin of our IDEXX VetLab and Rapid Assay products and our intent to sustain our Reference Lab operating and service capability to position ourselves for recovery in demand as market restrictions are lifted, we anticipate a high level of gross margin flow through impact from near-term CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue pressures. To mitigate these impacts, we have advanced prudent steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $25 million on a quarterly basis compared to the original plan levels. This includes temporary reductions in salaries of 30% for the CEO, 20% for officers and senior executives, and 10% for the majority of other salaried employees, which we plan to cease over time as business conditions improve, as well as temporary freezing of 401(k) matching contributions and suspension of cash compensation for IDEXX\u2019s is Board of Directors Our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we have taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity and flexibility to advance our business strategy and market position during this period. We ended Q1 with leverage ratios of 1.70 times gross and 1.59 times net of cash, with $81 million in cash and $360 million in capacity available on our then $850 million revolving credit facility. In April we increase committed financing availability by $350 million by expanding our credit facility to $1 billion under new three-year agreement and by issuing 200 million of 10-year 2.5% fixed rate notes. In the current environment where prior to funding of our business operations and have suspended our stock repurchase program. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong momentum demonstrated in our business in Q1. We have got a great business model and we are confident we can manage effectively through near-term impacts from COVID-19 in our CAG business, while positioning ourselves for a strong recovery in the highly attractive and resilient Companion Animal Health Care. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, for your comments on Q1 financial performance. We are pleased with our solid Q1 results despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. We went into the year with strong momentum and through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were still able to deliver 10 percentage points CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth in Q1, supported by double-digit growth in the U.S. and international in spite of impacts from China in the early part of the quarter, from Italy in early March, and then for much of Europe and North America shortly thereafter. Instrument placements were excellent in Q1 resulting in sustained year over year levels of Catalyst EBI. Our catalyst installed base grew 10% in North America and 25% internationally with the overall premium instrument installed base increasing 15%. We developed a new remote installation process for instruments, which also supported placements in impacted regions. The IDEXX Preventive Care program enrollments also achieved record levels with approximately 400 new enrollees and more than 4,200 cumulative enrollments since program inception. This was accomplished despite late quarter impacts from COVID-19. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution in record numbers and increasingly view it as a foundational element of their care offering. Though we expect in some cases for implementation to take a bit longer due to COVID-19 impacts, the IDEXX Preventive Care program will be a key element of what we and our customers see as a recover-together plan for North America. Our product innovations announced at VMX were launched on schedule and were enthusiastically greeted by customers. Our digital cytology placements starting in early March were primarily sold to larger IDEXX customers via our IDEXX 360 program. Customers are enthusiastic about our test promise, results, and expert interpretation in under two hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Catalyst Bile Acids with Reference Lab quality performance was also launched in the quarter. We are pleased with the adoption to date with over 340 customers. SediVue Neural Network 5.0 updates began rolling out in March and advanced bacteria detection kits starting to ship in April. Our innovation highlights also included the announcement in Q1 that we would begin monitoring clinically symptomatic pets for COVID-19 infection. We then announced in April that we would offer this test commercially throughout the world based on a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cats, experiments that demonstrated the susceptibility of cats and ferrets, and veterinarian demands for testing option. We expect this veterinary test to not have an impact on human COVID-19 testing or test availability. Additionally, the company\u2019s human health business OPTI Medical Systems is advancing support of human COVID-19 testing with a validated PCR test kit enabled by IDEXX\u2019s expertise in livestock PCR, test development and manufacturing. It is intended for limited initial distribution to existing customers, including labs serving animal production needs that have been repurposed for human COVID-19 testing. Moving to software, we saw excellent ongoing momentum in our software business, which I will speak to later, with over 10% growth in PIMS placements in North America, record orders for SmartFlow and with now over 4,800 customers on Web PACS subscriptions. Moving to a quick update on our European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. We have begun testing and it remains on track to transition by the end of Q2. We are excited by the world-class capabilities in this facility, which is 50% larger than our next biggest lab will bring to our European Reference Lab customers. Our team has done an amazing job to stay on track despite the pandemic. Finally, our Water and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy businesses, both performed solidly in Q1. Demand for livestock diagnostics testing is also considered essential and we are seeing sustained solid demand in our LPD business. Brian highlighted some of the dynamics we are seeing in the market and our testing volumes from COVID-19. Next I will discuss how we are managing in this environment, helping our customers and positioning ourselves for the future. Let\u2019s start with how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the IDEXX workplace and employee safety. Approximately 60% of our employees are now working from home. We have invested heavily and in telephony and IT infrastructure over many years, so that we were able to transition a majority of our employees home without missing a beat. Still other jobs require employees to be on site like those in manufacturing, distribution and the Reference Labs. We have instituted practices at these locations to minimize risk like staggered shifts or frequent and deeper cleaning and local social distancing procedures. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Not only have we launched products on schedule, like the previously mentioned digital cytology service, Catalyst Bile Acids and advanced bacteria detection for SediVue, but we continue to advance our product pipeline, as our teams are adapting to the new circumstances in highly creative ways. Moving to how veterinary practices are being impacted. They are experiencing similar challenges as other businesses based on client visits. The good news is that veterinary practice has been designated as essential businesses throughout the U.S. and in almost all countries. The vast majority are open and operating, and we are still performing essential services for their clients caring for sick and injured pets in need of attention. Demand for other services, including wellness visits and elective activities have slowed due to government policies and guidance from veterinary organizations designed to control COVID-19 spread. Though our veterinary customers are consequently seeing fewer patient visits at this point, volumes impacted are in line with the aggressiveness of social distancing procedures. Many services are only deferred, and we believe we will return relatively quickly as in past downturns once the recovery begins. We believe the bond between people and their companion animal family members is as strong as ever. As Brian noted, we have seen dampened demand relatively more in our Reference Lab business versus testing in the clinic. This is related in part to fewer preventive care visits versus those involving a sick patient. Further, practices like all businesses are also concerned with workplace and employee safety. They have instituted practices like curbside drop off and pickup, remote check in and bill pay, along with the creation of modified shifts for veterinary staff to ensure care team well-being and continuity for clients. Our field service organization has played an important role helping customers make these required adjustments to their practice workflow in this new COVID-19 environment. IDEXX sales professionals have also adjusted well to this dynamic, continuing to generate demand for our products and services. Virtual visits than our standard can be highly sophisticated. Our sales professionals are using tools like WebEx for demos and DocuSign to bring pipeline deals across the line. We also continue to visit practices when requested by a customer and with an appointment, abiding by necessary safety procedures. Our in-person availability has been welcomed by customers and in April, constituted about 25% of total U.S. visits. Veterinarians look to business partners at all times, but even more so now to have sufficient product supply on hand and be able to supply services like Reference Lab testing in an uninterrupted manner. They want to focus on their businesses and now that their partners can handle theirs. IDEXX has performed exceptionally well in this regard and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future. Our manufacturing operations are largely based in the U.S. and we have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our Reference Lab performance has been especially noteworthy in light of the disrupted flight schedules, challenging logistics and more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employee safe. With over 80 labs worldwide, not unexpectedly, there have been a handful of instances where it needed to temporarily shut a facility for a short time due to an employee being or suspected of being infectious. Because of our network lab capability across regions and geographies, we were able to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption or deterioration. These capabilities are unique in the industry and only possible because we have made significant investments over a very long period of time in lab density, common lab\u2019s information management systems, and courier route and logistics capability. We also deployed a global lab digital cytology service in the middle of all of this, another example of global agility and advantage. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. Our expansion in the U.S. was completed going into Q1 and the team seamlessly settled into the new territories and account assignments. Our account managers continue to call on customers with similar frequency, but now the majority of visits are virtual. Our European commercial team continues to mature in the VDC model and is also performing at a high level. We entered into the year with record customer loyalty across modalities and all actions taken to date have been taken with the long-term view to continue to earn this loyalty for years to come. IDEXX veterinary software and services are also playing an important customer enabling role in this pandemic. Right now, customers are being forced to rethink how they deliver patient care, and IDEXX\u2019s software solutions both new and existing to help them adapt. The IDEXX telehealth offering includes a multiple third-party -- includes multiple third-party telehealth integrations into our global PIMS offering, 90-day free secure remote access for our Cornerstone customers, the ability to use SmartFlow through an iPad from their parking lot for curbside check-in, and contactless payment processing integrated with their IDEXX PIMS. These capabilities enable customers to deliver remote care, as well as continue to see patients in their practices while abiding by social distancing guidelines. We also believe that in the medium term, telehealth can expand demand for diagnostics, the deeper pet owner client connections enabled by real time, convenient communications that millennial pet owners expect and pet owners of all ages appreciate. Further, telehealth has a potential to expand patient access, especially for cats, who comprise only approximately 20% of practice visits today. Next, I will share a snapshot view of the health of the business. There are broad macroeconomic uncertainties as to the depth and length of the impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, our focus has been on what we can control in our plans for recovery. We took quick and deliberate action to prudently control costs, while leaving us well-positioned for future growth. These include a temporary salary reduction, reductions in our essential business and capital expenses and a cessation of stock buybacks. Our intent is to seize those reductions that are temporary like salary reductions as conditions improve. Critically, these actions were taken in ways that allow us to preserve the considerable strategic advantages, talent and organizational engagement we have as a company. Our financial strength has allowed us to support veterinarians at a time when they need us most, and I believe they will reward our approach with their business long into the future. We have taken practical actions which extend payment terms for customers who need it, as well as to provide near term flexibility for minimum commitments, while maintaining these long-term diagnostic partnership agreements with customers. Customers have given us and will continue to give us as much testing volume as possible. Our focus is therefore to support the health of their practices and allow them to focus on delivering excellent medical care in a challenging environment and when the time comes, support them as they quickly rebuild client traffic. We participate in great markets. Nothing has changed in this regard due to COVID-19 social distancing practices that have temporarily limited veterinary visits. If anything, pet owners have become even more attached to their companions as they spend even more time with them at home. Pet adoptions and fostering at an all-time high and breeders in many instances report waiting list of 12 or more months. And most importantly, pets still need to go to the veterinarian and most pet owners do not consider these visits to be discretionary. Diagnostics will continue to play a central and growing role in the care of the patient, as well as practice health. Many practices have seen accelerating impact from e-tailers gains in online sales of food and medicine. This is business that is not likely to come back at the same levels. Veterinarians will continue to look for practice categories like diagnostics that are medically necessary, drive the care envelope and almost always best done in the practice. Our belief is that as a result of pent-up demand from COVID-19, which has constrained care that is desired and needed, though perhaps not time critical, veterinary practices might experience a stronger V-shape recovery than the vast majority of other market segments. We see some early evidence of this in select markets like China and Australia and regions within the U.S. where these markets have begun to relax strict shelter at home policies. Practices will be in good shape to meaningfully take up where they left off, though they have reduced hours and furloughed employees in some instances, we believe that there isn\u2019t structural damage to the industry or the balance sheet of practice owners. As practices rebuild client traffic with a focus on wellness care, we will be there with our strategic advantages fully impact. We are using this time wisely, continuing to advance our product pipeline, strengthen relationships and provide exceptional day-to-day service. Unique capabilities that we bring are now even more widely appreciated and keep in mind that this is a highly resilient business with a history of outperforming in economic recovery periods. While these are difficult times, they are an important reminder of our company purpose and that what we do makes a big difference in the lives of pets, people and livestock. I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the team for their extraordinary support during this period. Now, we will take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks for taking the questions guys. I want to talk about some of the stuff you just touched on Jay, the cost cuts and the salary reductions you implemented earlier in the quarter. Can you talk us through the rationale of that move? It seem like it happen a little bit sooner and was more significant than initially expected. You talked about the V-shaped recovery and the sharp rebound and yet those are some of the meaningful cuts. Is there any concern that you could see increased employee turnover potentially to some of your competitors as a result of this and what criteria are you using to determine when you are with some of these measures, given the improvements you have noted and some end market.\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. I will cover some of the high level, high level thinking and philosophy behind us and then Brian may want to talk through some of the specifics in terms of how we were thinking about that. We have a great business. We have a great organization. We really approach shifts with the idea that we want to, that we are going to come out of this that we are going to come out of this strong with the market. The pet owners love their pets that they believe that taking their pets to that veterinarians and getting testing is the right thing to do. We know that the veterinarians believe that testing is good medicine and uncovers disease. And so we wanted to approach this in a way that allows us to maintain all of our strategic advantages. These are advantages that we have built up, not just a year or two, but over decades. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, 80 plus Reference Labs, common labs, information management systems, courier route, service levels that are exceptional including weekends. We don\u2019t want to lose any of that capability. We don\u2019t want to -- we want to be able to continue to execute our product roadmap, maintain high engagement in the organization, continue to deliver exceptional service levels, make sure that we have supply when customers need it. And most importantly, if you take a look at our customer facing organizations maintaining full staff levels and being able to continue to serve customers is even more importantly. So we did this in a way that we think it was prudent that maintains engagement that the organization understands and responded to positively and so that as we come out of this, all of these strategic advantages, organizational capability, and engagement remain intact. So, Brian do you want to address that.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. I think, we -- as I mentioned in some of the, the commentary we provided early on in this, I think the stay at home policies and that were being implemented late March, very early April where we are seeing significant impacts and we didn\u2019t have clarity on how that might evolve and thought it was prudent to get out in front of that. And as Jay highlighted, we had a goal of protecting employment and trying to find ways to mitigate what we were expecting in terms of some near-term impacts without damaging our underlying ability to advance our business strategy or serve customers. And I think the intent was to cease those cuts when it made sense, I think we are very encouraged by the recent trends. It\u2019s improving significantly day by day. And so I think we will keep an eye on this, but I think that was, that was the intent, the changes were implemented at a time where I think the, the depth of the impact from the social distancing policies was more significant.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. Are you seeing any sort of changes in the competitive landscape at this point? Can you take advantage of any competitor disruption on either at the point of care side of the business or Reference Lab, given that you can withstand this sort of volatility to be a little bit more nimble in this environment? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Thanks for the question, Erin. Yeah. We have always said that our markets that have historically been very competitive. It\u2019s no different now, even if it\u2019s within the COVID-19 environment. They continue to be very competitive. We are very pleased with the way -- with the inroads that we continue to make in terms of, if you take a look at the competitive catalyst placements globally, we were up 17% premium installed base year-over-year, 15%. We continue to expand Reference Lab testing. The point-of-care solutions like VetLab have held up relatively well in the COVID-19 environment. Now part of that is due to the fact that they support more sick patient testing with real time results. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, before the COVID-19 impact, we were at a solid middle teens in the U.S. from a growth standpoint, high single-digits internationally. So we did see some drop-off in volume in line with the visits and prioritizing case management, as Brian described it. But we have also seen even now, with the drop-off and the beginnings of a recovery that customers have a new appreciation, a far deeper appreciation for what we are bringing in terms of service levels, lab network, density, courier, logistics, all of those things. And I think what they are seeing from some other participants in the marketplace is they don\u2019t have that capability in that footprint to be able to provide that level of service.\nErin Wright: Okay. Great. And then can you remind us of the sustainability of pricing across your business in prior economic downturns? And can you also speak to how minimum purchase agreements associated with consumables are impacted from the COVID disruption as well? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So from -- in Q1, we continue to realize modest price realization of between 2% and 3%. Relative to future pricing dynamics, we are certainly not going to forecast that today. The thing that I would point out is that customers don\u2019t just think about price per se. They look at price within the context of overall value from what they get. We are always pressure testing the economics within that value construct. In terms of actually the programs themselves, we do have volume. We do have volume-based commercial programs and in some cases we are making allowances for rebalancing obligations where programs, just I think reflect the reality that there is some reduced client traffic in testing volumes and what to be able to support our customers through that.\nOperator: And our next question will be from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe for Jay or Brian, is there a way to think about how much sort of loss versus deferred revenue. In other words, you are growth has been so consistent and durable every year around 10% to 12% organic. If the growth just to throw out a number is up low-single digits this year, when we think about 2021, can we sort of go back to that 10% to 12% off of that low single-digit number or is there a chance for, call it, a big acceleration mid-teens growth as we think about the deferred coming back? And I think that is just an important area that everyone is trying to get their arms around. I\u2019m defaulting to lost revenue because an emergency would have occurred and I don\u2019t think you do to wellness is in 1H \u201821, but maybe if you can go ahead and talk to that? That would be helpful.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. I think, as you point out, Jon, it\u2019s a little difficult to estimate at the moment. I think our feeling is that there will be a level of pent-up demand here for care that will come back as people are able to access vet clinics. It\u2019s likely there is a level of kind of sick patient care that is just going to be lost in terms of the impacts at this time and it is just until we kind of work through this, and going to get back to what we think is going to be a rebound to a good place in terms of the industry\u2019s health. It\u2019s a little tough to project that out, which is why we are moving away from guidance at the moment. But I think the under -- we feel the underlying fundamentals of the industry are very sound. We think that working through the dynamics with our customers will only reinforce these advantages that we have as a business, and I think, we will be very well positioned to grow as we come out of this.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. I will share with you, Jon, a couple of things we are hearing from veterinarians. Let me focus on and well this that because to your point, if the patient is sick and or needs a surgery, they have obviously still have the opportunity to do that. If you take at look at Q1, we had a record number of preventive care enrollments in the first quarter, 400. So, that puts the overall program at 4,200 to-date, as I indicated earlier. But the important thing about preventative care, just as a category, is pet owners see that as something that\u2019s not discretionary, something that they truly prioritize for their pet. And more and more what practice owners in veterinarians are telling us is not only do they consider this is good medicine because it uncovers more and drives the care above. It\u2019s important to their practice economics. It is important to client engagement. So I see it from both the medical necessity and practice health standpoint. So, they are chomping at the bit. That speaks to what Brian had indicated, where we are relatively optimistic around sort of this pent-up demand and more of a V-shaped recovery. It\u2019s part of our -- it\u2019s going to be part of our recovery strategy, Recover Together strategy to emphasize that. There\u2019s still tons of work to do on sick patient testing in addition to preventative care. So we are relatively optimistic.\nJon Block: Okay. And Jay, maybe just a follow-up on that last point. The one thing that we are hearing about COVID-19 is just the change of workflow within the practice, curbside pickup sort of spacing out the visits more. At the end of the day, it is reducing the overall number of visits, just from a workflow perspective and I think it\u2019s unclear how long this hangs around, right. How it plays out over time. So you talk about this V-shape recovery, but do you have any concerns that this altered workflow as a lasting impact sort of which results in a more protractive return to normal for the industry? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. I mean just that -- just a couple of observations. Yeah. The first couple of weeks, veterinary practices, they may struggle to adapt workflow. I mean, partly it was drop off in visits, but partly as you describe it, the extent -- they had to extend appointment blocks, and it was more challenging for them. That we worked with customers through our field service organization to be able to help them design new workflows in terms of curbside drop off and pick up, and remote check in and contactless payment processes. They have gotten much better at it, just like you would expect that over time you begin to optimize your processes. So, different states, different regions are in different stages of recovery and so initially it was only from the parking lot. I think over time, we will see that relaxation. Yeah, there is a point that I would make just tying together your two questions is that when you take a look at what\u2019s happened within the practices, with the e-tailers and a lot of product sales, both food and medicines going online. The -- a lot of that business is not going to return at least at the same levels that they experienced before. That\u2019s going to put even more focus on getting the patient into the practice, having checkups using diagnostics. So, again, we will see how this develops over time, but I think all the trends are positive.\nJon Block: Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.\nOperator: We have a question in queue from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Go ahead.\nRyan Daniels: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jay, can you talk a little bit more about Recover Together. It sounds like you have developed specific blueprint for kind of the bounce back. So I\u2019m curious what that involves and how your marketing that.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s really comes out with the fact that, even within this COVID-19 environment, we are still highly engaged with our customers. Our customer facing folks are our visiting customers 75% just take the U.S. for example is virtual, but 25% when requested were present and fully decked out and its safety care. So there is a high level of engagement. We are building pipeline. We are working with -- our customers in terms of developing strategies that as we recover they rebuild client traffic. We saw coming out of the great recession in 2009 that a lot of really good our clients or pet owners returned almost immediately. Where the veterinarian\u2019s I think need it needed some help and assistance is for those relatively new clients to help build the muscle memory of semi-annual or annual visits. So we are looking at programs that we have for example our preventive care program is perfect for that. And even the sick patient visits are allowed are advised, there are still some things that people are likely pet owners and likely deferring. So we are looking at all of our programs to be able to support that. Just one word on the IDEXX 360, because it\u2019s really tailor-made for this type of environment. Yeah, if you think about IDEXX 360 you are able to get capital purchases with zero money down. So if you are veterinary practice if you are in this constrained environment from an economic standpoint, you can still purchase instruments and you pay on a monthly basis and you are able to match invoicing to the customer with testing volumes. So in some ways it\u2019s really tailor-made to test for this type of environment. So we are looking at all of those things in terms of how to support customers.\nRyan Daniels: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then a little bit more color on OPTI Medical. I know that doesn\u2019t get a lot of airtime, an acquisition you did to benefit the companion animal business. But what\u2019s the potential for that if you get FDA approval and kind of how will that process go. I assume you will have a distribution partner for that in the human market, any color there? Thanks guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So we have developed and validated a human real-time PCR test for COVID-19 and really to your question, we leveraged the capability we have in OPTI, which is our human health business from a regulatory standpoint and channels, but also our experience in developing and manufacturing livestock infectious disease kits in our current business. So this is a test, it is a PCR test. It is highly effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity from a performance standpoint. Results -- you typically get results in well under four hours, so it\u2019s fairly quick, and we have used, OPTI is used or is in a process of using the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization process. We are waiting for approval, as well as we have applied for CE Mark in the European Union. And so we are advancing our ability to manufacture these in our Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy business, and really targeting for initial distribution existing IDEXX customers. So not necessarily using external channel, so these include things like livestock, laboratories, public health laboratory, state CDC labs, stuff entities like that.\nOperator: Our next question, we will go to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess to start, I think, Jay you mentioned, vet services are tended to be pretty resilient during past downturns and obviously consumers are going to be facing kind of uncertain economic conditions coming out of this. I guess I\u2019d be curious just, when you look at wellness visit in recent weeks, I mean has there been any change in metrics like the percentage of those visits that include blood work, the number of test orders that might provide an indication of the consumer\u2019s ability to spend on diagnostics for their pets?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So let me -- I will answer that question in a couple of levels, because you had mentioned the recessionary environment and the resilience of the business, which is absolutely true. When you take a look at the great recession in 2009, we performed extremely well growing 5%, coming out of the trough of that and if you now, we say, 10 years later, we are even I think better positioned to be able to perform strongly in a V-shaped recovery. So you think about the business as a whole. we are extremely well diversified, geography across businesses like CAG, Water, livestock, poultry and dairy across different modalities and plus lots of shapes. So just a couple of things that I would emphasis, which includes our commercial organization with, if you take a look at a decade ago, we were represented primarily through distributors and now we have more direct representation and so we are not reliant on others. I think the fact that our portfolio is far broader and includes sick and some of the wellness pieces that you emphasized. And I think the role of diagnostics is far more appreciated and how important it is and really how it feeds into not only good medical care but practice health. In terms of the component of diagnostics over the recent couple of weeks and what that looks like. Not sure we have visibility to that data yet. That\u2019s something that we will continue to look at on a weekly basis in terms of both lab accessions as well as the smart service, what the testing piece is, but still too early to comment specifically on that question.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. I would highlight, I think the, as we are looking at this data day by day literally, it\u2019s very encouraging to see how quickly it\u2019s coming back. So, I think, it\u2019s -- we think that\u2019s reinforcing the willingness that we have seen for a long time of the pet owners spend on critical care and that for their what is now a member of the family, I think this was even more powerful than it was over 10 years ago when the last great recession. So early indications are we are very encouraged by and those areas we will continue to monitor.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, as you have seen restrictions start to ease in some areas, have you also seen kind of reps visits pick back up, I\u2019m just curious to know if there could maybe be more prolonged impact there. Is that\u2019s kind of one of limit the number of sales reps that they see in the clinic, just due to the concerns around COVID?\nJay Mazelsky: I\u2019m sorry, I missed that part where you said the number of what visits pick back.\nNathan Rich: Well, I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. Have your sales reps, I guess, been able to start to go, call on customers in areas where restrictions have eased and could that have a more prolonged impact on -- which is their ability to kind of get back in and see customers.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Okay. I got it. Absolutely. The way we conduct visits today is when customers ask us to be present or that differs than a lot of other companies out there that have essentially 100% virtual visit policy. So if you take a look at April, for example, 25% of the visits of the field organization was actually physically visiting the practice. Now, if you break that down by states and regions, it did differ based on the how strict the social distancing procedures were in the practice. What we saw in places like Texas and the South relatively more visits, relatively higher visit levels in terms of clients and more testing. Impacted - higher impacted regions like the Northeast and the Great Lakes, for example, a bit lower. So, very much in line and proportional to what the local guidelines are per se per region.\nNathan Rich: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question in queue from the line of David Westenberg. Just one moment please while we open his line.\nDavid Westenberg: All right. Thank you for taking the questions. So I\u2019m just a layer on some of the questions that have already been asked. Can you talk about your balance sheet right now, some of the rationale between taking on the additional debt. Is that at all sense, can we expect at the practice level, maybe there is some liquidity needs, and right now it\u2019s your opportunity to help those practices that need to preserve cash? And then, just related to that, do you think that they are going to be more likely to avoid the cash flow and sign the contract or do you think there might actually be some hesitancy on that contract? And then as a follow-up on the near term, can you quantify the pent-up demand. I know VCA used to say in their practice, they have an 80% recovery rate in a snowstorm kind of environment of those appointments. Is that a good way to think about it in terms of when social distancing ends and I will take these questions offline? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, David. Just on your balance sheet question. I think we have some of the work out and we highlighted was in flight before the pandemic really started impacting the business. We were in the process of securing some of the terminal financing at low rates and we are able to execute that effectively in our revolver -- was up for renegotiation this year regardless. So I think we just advanced that and we are able to extend it and actually upsize it. And I think we, we were in an excellent position. We are in an even better position. And I think you raised a very good point. It enables us to continue to be highly supportive of our customers, and we are helping independent practices in the U.S. and Europe with some payment term dynamics in the near-term and trying to be as helpful as we can. As Jay mentioned, I think, our programs are very well suited to helping people through if they have near-term concerns about cash flow management to continue to advance their businesses and we will continue to be leaning in on that front and helping practices in ways that makes sense for us all to move back to normal over time together.\nJay Mazelsky: I mean, I would just also again reemphasize the IDEXX 360 program is ideal in many respects for new customer acquisition and its environment. No cash outlays matching customer invoices with the use of consumables. And the other thing David is we are able to calibrate future commitment expectations for customers in terms of how we use this. So, I think, we all recognize that this is a unique environment and we can highly configure these type of volume commitment programs for that environment.\nDavid Westenberg: And then if I could just get on that the recovery rate, if there is any way to quantify like if VCA\u2019s 80% recovery on weather related thing that used to give five years ago when they were public, but\u2026\nBrian McKeon: We don\u2019t have benchmarks like that. I\u2019m not sure snowstorm is the best analogy at the moment. This is -- it\u2019s very dynamic region by region, but I think as a theme, we are very encouraged by how quickly we see demand coming back as policies are less restrictive and we are optimistic about how this will play out over time.\nDavid Westenberg: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Go ahead please.\nAndrew Cooper: Hey, everybody. Thanks for the questions. A lot is uncovered. So I will maybe just ask one kind of attacking something a little bit differently. But as we think about the transition to virtual visits and obviously you are still doing a number of in-person, but when we think about installs, you have done a lot of second instruments and things like that as a portion of your growth. When we think about demand for that, obviously, it\u2019s a little bit different than sort of a net new competitive placement, but how do we think about exiting when clinics aren\u2019t necessarily seeing the same volumes that they were? Does that delay that need or potentially our clinics that are well capitalized sitting there saying, hey, we can get an installing without really disrupting as busy of a day where we are kind of working at full capacity as it is. Any comment there just kind of on the pace of instrument installations would be great as you come out of this.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Let me -- yeah. There is a couple of questions in that. Let me just address the question around or the point you made around second catalyst placements at practices. These tend to go to higher volume customers. So it\u2019s not like we are placing a second catalysts and it\u2019s just sitting there. I mean, the reason they may want a second catalyst as they are growing their practice, growing client visits. It is a highly modular system. So this represents a real volume driven decision on the part of customers. We think from a recovery standpoint, as well as longer term trends. The diagnostics utilization will continue to be robust for sick patient, preventive care, menu offering our product roadmap and the different assays we are launching continue to drive, continue to drive usage, continue to drive utilization, though it\u2019s somewhat lower now because of this environment. We think that all the dynamics and all sort of the value drivers are still intact. So we don\u2019t expect through the recovery for that to change.\nBrian McKeon: We have time for one more question.\nAndrew Cooper: I will stop there if anybody else is in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, guys. Thanks. I think I dropped off the initial one. Thanks for the follow-up. Just real quick, I want to go back to some of my concern sort of longer term about the vet dynamic. As we think through this impact sort of what\u2019s forefront of my mind is that, that\u2019s going to be economically challenged here in potentially for an extended period of time. Both from economic recession and potentially some, some tail risk here in terms of volumes. So how do you think about vets being a little bit more price sensitive around their offerings and we know that IDEXX is definitely the premium brand in the space in terms of pricing compared to Heska and Abaxis and the cheaper alternatives. Are you concerned that would be while diagnostics utilization overall and visits made holding pretty well due to the economic challenges and some of the pressures on them, they may trade down to some of the cheaper offerings?\nJay Mazelsky: So here\u2019s I would -- here\u2019s how at least we think about it, Mike. Customers have always been concerned with the economics of the solution. I mean that hasn\u2019t changed. Price is a component of it. The value that we deliver is the other component of it. And as I indicated, we are always testing to make sure that the value and economics line up. From a customer standpoint, what we work to do through our programs is to make sure that based on their environment and based on the circumstances, we provide the appropriate program that allows them to purchase what they think are the best tools and allow them to deliver the best medicine. From that standpoint, nothing has changed in terms of our solutions and what they perceive to be the best solutions for their needs. And as I indicated, we have programs that allow them to get that, get the products, get the service offerings they want and do it in a way that works for them, works from an economic standpoint and matches and aligns the invoices that they collect or charge to the client and what they have to in turn pay us. So we are confident that we can continue to meet their dates and do it in a way that\u2019s economically sensitive to the environment.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much.\nJay Mazelsky: And with that, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call and I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance there in these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that both delivers the day and takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will be using a somewhat different format for today's financial review. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter financial results, which resulted in solid revenue and profit gains despite late quarter impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will then spend time discussing the near-term dynamics that we are seeing in the companion animal health care market, including evolving impacts from COVID-19 containment approaches on clinical visits and diagnostic testing levels. We will review how we plan to manage in this environment and highlight the steps we have taken to mitigate near-term P&L impacts and strengthen our balance sheet and flexibility to position our business for a strong recovery. While we are optimistic about the ability of the pet health care market and IDEXX's business in particular to rebound strongly from near-term COVID-19 effects we are withdrawing our full-year financial guidance as we work through these dynamics. As such, we won't be providing an update on that front today. Let's start with an overview of our Q1 results. IDEXX delivered 9% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, supported by 10% growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting double-digit gains across both U.S. and international markets, as well as solid gains in our Water and LPD businesses. Overall, organic revenue growth benefited by less than 1% from accelerated stocking orders in our Water and LPD businesses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending very strongly, above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were also tracking towards an excellent instrument placement quarter driven by continued momentum in new and competitive catalysts placements globally. These gains were against a backdrop of improved market trends, reflected in 4% same-store growth in U.S. clinical visits through this period. As social distancing policies advanced more broadly in Europe and the U.S. through March and as vet clinics adapted to prioritize health care procedures to align with industry and government guidelines, we saw significant declines in clinical visit activity and restriction on access to vet clinics, which moderated our Q1 revenue gains. Despite these impacts, our business momentum enabled strong overall Q1 organic revenue growth across our modalities. Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9%, reflecting 8% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions, offset by a 1% FX headwind. Through early March, Global Lab organic growth rates were excellent, driven by continued mid teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. and high single-digit gains in international markets. For Q1 overall, late quarter social distancing impacts constrained U.S. lab organic growth to high single-digit rates and international lab organic growth to the low-to-mid single-digit range. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% on an organic basis, despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts, reflecting low double-digit gains in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in international markets. Our consumable revenue growth results through early March were also very strong benefiting from an expanded premium instrument installed base, sustained high levels of customer retention and continued gains in testing utilization. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high in Q1 reflected in 238 catalysts placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 698 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 273 second catalyst placements driven by momentum with North American customers. These gains and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 17% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 760 premium hematology placements and 408 SediVue placements bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9300 instruments, up 32% year-on-year. Restriction on access to vet clinics in late March led to deferrals of quarter-end in placements, however, which contributed to year-on-year instrument organic revenue declines of 16% overall in the first quarter. Rapid Assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q1 despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts supported by solid volume growth in SNAP 4Dx Plus first-generation and specialty products and moderate net price gains. First quarter results reflected normal promotional and customer stocking activity, which supported volume gains ahead of the peak testing season. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues achieved 11% organic growth, supported by continued strong gains in recurring service revenues, as well as sustained solid sales of new Cornerstone and digital imaging systems, and strong growth in our Neo and SmartFlow cloud-based software offerings. Overall gains were also constrained by COVID-19 related impacts on vet clinics late in Q1, which led to a deferral of new software and digital system installations. Turning to our other business segments, we saw a strong performance in our Water and LPD businesses in Q1. Water revenues increased 15% organically, including an estimated $2 million or 8% growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Overall, our Water business demand has remained solid globally as drinking water testing remains an essential service and priority for local governments and utilities. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 12% organically in Q1, including approximately $3 million or 9% of growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. LPD results benefited for demand for -- from demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China. We are also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing. Overall LPD gains were constrained in Q1 by lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of herd populations in key Asia-Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Livestock diagnostics are also considered essential services supporting continued demand for LPD products. Turning to the P&L, profit results were strong in Q1 benefiting from solid revenue gains and controlled operating expense growth. Operating profit in Q1 increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid operating profit growth across our CAG Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased approximately 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting operating expense leverage on strong revenue gains. Gross profit increased 8% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis in Q1. Gross margins were relatively flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis, as benefits from strong Consumable and Water growth and continued moderate net price gains were offset by relatively lower margins in our Reference Lab business, reflecting late quarter pressure on lab revenues related to COVID-19 impacts, lab capacity investments advanced in 2019 and effects from the integration of the Marshfield acquisition. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis. Operating expense increases were driven by cost related to the expansion of our Global CAG commercial capability advanced in 2019 and growth in corporate, general, and administrative costs, including the on-boarding of our Westbrook Maine headquarters expansion. During the quarter, we benefited from early efforts to prioritize investments and controlled discretionary spending to mitigate emerging COVID-19 impacts. EPS in Q1 was a $1.29 per share including tax benefits of $6.6 million or $0.08 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 13%. Overall, we are pleased to have delivered strong financial results in Q1, despite late quarter headwinds related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's now spend some time discussing how social distancing policies and associated restrictions on business activity are impacting veterinary clinic visits and our CAG business in the near-term. Clinical visits have been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of social distancing protocols, as well as the industry guidelines for the prioritization of sick patient and emergency procedures at vet clinics.  These dynamics can be seen in U.S. vet clinic tracking data, which is shown in the earnings snapshot on our IR website. We have added weekly tracking data for 2020 clinical visits extended through the week ended April 24th in the snapshot, as well as detail for wellness and non-wellness visits. As shown in this data, for the first quarter through early March on a same-store basis, clinical visits were up approximately 4% in the U.S., a solid improvement from 2019 trends. As social distancing procedures expanded in March, we saw a sharp correction in these trends, with same-store U.S. clinical visits declining approximately 25% for the weeks ended March 27th through April 10th with 15% to 20% year-on-year declines in sick patient visits and 35% to 40% declines in wellness visits during this period. We saw similar dynamics in European markets with more significant declines in severely impacted regions like Italy and Spain, as well as markets which implemented more restrictive stay-at-home policies like the U.K. In addition to this clinical visit data, we have been monitoring rolling weekly averages for chemistry slide run volumes and Rapid Assay runs through our global smart service connectivity, as well as rolling weekly trends for accession volumes in our Reference Labs. In the late March through the early to mid April period, we saw meaningful pressure on diagnostic testing levels associated with the restrictions on veterinary clinical activity. These initial impacts were relatively more significant in our Reference Lab and Rapid Assay businesses with average weekly volume declines of approximately 30% in the U.S. and approximately 35% in Europe during this period, with more moderate impacts in Asia-Pacific markets. Testing volume in these modalities were impacted in part by the de-emphasis of wellness testing at clinics as part of the pandemic response, consistent with industry guidelines. VetLab in clinic chemistry run volumes to relatively less effective during this initial period reflected an approximately 20% run declines in the U.S. and 25% declines in Europe. These metrics reflected lower test utilization levels, as well as moderate reduction in the number of clinics actively operating during this initial high impact period. Over the last two weeks, we have seen significant improvement in clinical visit and diagnostic testing trends. These changes reinforced the high resilience of demand for companion animal health care and may indicate that we work through the bottom of near-term COVID-19 effects on veterinary care. For the most recent week ended April 24th, overall U.S. clinical visits declines have moderated to 15% year-on-year with only 9% year-on-year declines for sick patient visits and 24% year-on-year declines for wellness visits, with steady improvement across U.S. regions week by week. We are seeing similar indications of improvement in European markets and in Asian regions which were impacted at an earlier stage by the pandemic. In terms of our business, we continue to see pressure on diagnostic testing levels. However, these impacts have improved meaningfully. In the U.S. and Europe on a rolling seven-day basis, IDEXX VetLab chemistry run declines have now moderated to approximately 5% year-on-year and Reference Lab accession volume declines have moderated to 10% to 15% overall, with continued steady weekly improvement across regions. Chemistry slide runs in leading-edge markets like China have actually returned to double-digit growth over the last eight weeks following the significant initial impacts on clinical activity. These changes vary by region may change depending on region specific dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall recent trends have been very encouraging. As we track data on COVID-19 related impacts over time, some insights are emerging. One insight is that most veterinary practices have sustained operations as an essential service through this initial high social distancing period positioning the market for a strong recovery. In the U.S., our tracking of the number of customers doing chemistry runs only declined to about 90% to 95% of prior year levels during the peak pressure period in early April and has now returned to prior levels over the last two weeks. Active customer tracking metrics have also rebounded strongly in Europe where we saw more meaningful reduction in active clinic levels earlier in the COVID-19 expansion in lockdown regions like Italy and Spain. We are seeing the same structural market strength in Asia-Pacific regions as well. The second insight is that the effects on diagnostic testing levels appear to be heavily influenced by the stage of development of COVID-19 case management and the associated stage of stay at home and social distancing procedures. There is a significant variation in the level of decline in diagnostic testing volumes by region. Regions with higher relative COVID-19 cases and expanded lockdown policies have experienced much more significant clinical visit and diagnostic testing volume declines. As an example, clinical visits in the Northeast U.S. declined approximately 35% in late March to mid April, while Southern U.S. regions decline approximately 20% during this period with more recent data from Southern U.S. region showing year-on-year declines of less than 10% overall. Internationally, near-term pressure and lab accession volumes in regions like Germany have been much more moderate compared to markets with extended lockdown conditions like the U.K. and Canada. In Asia-Pacific markets, we are also seeing moderated impact in regions that are farther along in terms of managing pandemic effects, including recent solid growth in the IDEXX Lab chemistry runs in markets like Australia, which has less restrictive social distancing controls. This is dynamic we will continue to monitor and which is challenging to predict. Overall, it does appear that as regions move past peak levels for COVID-19 cases and adjust stay at home and social distancing procedures, near-term pressures on clinical visit activity and related diagnostic testing lessen significantly. While we remain very optimistic about the health care market and IDEXX's ongoing growth opportunity reinforced by recent encouraging trends, COVID-19 pandemic effects will pressure our near-term revenue results. Given the high gross margin of our IDEXX VetLab and Rapid Assay products and our intent to sustain our Reference Lab operating and service capability to position ourselves for recovery in demand as market restrictions are lifted, we anticipate a high level of gross margin flow through impact from near-term CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue pressures. To mitigate these impacts, we have advanced prudent steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $25 million on a quarterly basis compared to the original plan levels. This includes temporary reductions in salaries of 30% for the CEO, 20% for officers and senior executives, and 10% for the majority of other salaried employees, which we plan to cease over time as business conditions improve, as well as temporary freezing of 401(k) matching contributions and suspension of cash compensation for IDEXX's is Board of Directors Our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we have taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity and flexibility to advance our business strategy and market position during this period. We ended Q1 with leverage ratios of 1.70 times gross and 1.59 times net of cash, with $81 million in cash and $360 million in capacity available on our then $850 million revolving credit facility. In April we increase committed financing availability by $350 million by expanding our credit facility to $1 billion under new three-year agreement and by issuing 200 million of 10-year 2.5% fixed rate notes. In the current environment where prior to funding of our business operations and have suspended our stock repurchase program. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong momentum demonstrated in our business in Q1. We have got a great business model and we are confident we can manage effectively through near-term impacts from COVID-19 in our CAG business, while positioning ourselves for a strong recovery in the highly attractive and resilient Companion Animal Health Care. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Yeah. I think, we -- as I mentioned in some of the, the commentary we provided early on in this, I think the stay at home policies and that were being implemented late March, very early April where we are seeing significant impacts and we didn't have clarity on how that might evolve and thought it was prudent to get out in front of that. And as Jay highlighted, we had a goal of protecting employment and trying to find ways to mitigate what we were expecting in terms of some near-term impacts without damaging our underlying ability to advance our business strategy or serve customers. And I think the intent was to cease those cuts when it made sense, I think we are very encouraged by the recent trends. It's improving significantly day by day. And so I think we will keep an eye on this, but I think that was, that was the intent, the changes were implemented at a time where I think the, the depth of the impact from the social distancing policies was more significant. Yeah. I think, as you point out, Jon, it's a little difficult to estimate at the moment. I think our feeling is that there will be a level of pent-up demand here for care that will come back as people are able to access vet clinics. It's likely there is a level of kind of sick patient care that is just going to be lost in terms of the impacts at this time and it is just until we kind of work through this, and going to get back to what we think is going to be a rebound to a good place in terms of the industry's health. It's a little tough to project that out, which is why we are moving away from guidance at the moment. But I think the under -- we feel the underlying fundamentals of the industry are very sound. We think that working through the dynamics with our customers will only reinforce these advantages that we have as a business, and I think, we will be very well positioned to grow as we come out of this. Yeah. I would highlight, I think the, as we are looking at this data day by day literally, it's very encouraging to see how quickly it's coming back. So, I think, it's -- we think that's reinforcing the willingness that we have seen for a long time of the pet owners spend on critical care and that for their what is now a member of the family, I think this was even more powerful than it was over 10 years ago when the last great recession. So early indications are we are very encouraged by and those areas we will continue to monitor. Thanks, David. Just on your balance sheet question. I think we have some of the work out and we highlighted was in flight before the pandemic really started impacting the business. We were in the process of securing some of the terminal financing at low rates and we are able to execute that effectively in our revolver -- was up for renegotiation this year regardless. So I think we just advanced that and we are able to extend it and actually upsize it. And I think we, we were in an excellent position. We are in an even better position. And I think you raised a very good point. It enables us to continue to be highly supportive of our customers, and we are helping independent practices in the U.S. and Europe with some payment term dynamics in the near-term and trying to be as helpful as we can. As Jay mentioned, I think, our programs are very well suited to helping people through if they have near-term concerns about cash flow management to continue to advance their businesses and we will continue to be leaning in on that front and helping practices in ways that makes sense for us all to move back to normal over time together. We don't have benchmarks like that. I'm not sure snowstorm is the best analogy at the moment. This is -- it's very dynamic region by region, but I think as a theme, we are very encouraged by how quickly we see demand coming back as policies are less restrictive and we are optimistic about how this will play out over time. We have time for one more question."

            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Today, we are pleased to report strong Q1 results, despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. As we will discuss, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our care customers in unusual ways, given broad based social distancing efforts, which are changing the ways veterinarians are prioritizing and providing care. We are working through these near-term dynamics, ensuring that we are fully supporting these essential health services in a way that prioritizes our customers' needs. We are doing this while we continue to advance our business strategy. Today, Brian will review our Q1 results and provide an update on current trends that we are seeing in our markets and our business. He will also describe the steps that were taken to mitigate near-term impacts and position ourselves for a strong and sustained recovery in the highly attractive pet health care market. I will then talk more about how we are seeing trends evolve in the market and how we are managing our business for the near-term and the long-term in this context. Now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thank you, Brian, for your comments on Q1 financial performance. We are pleased with our solid Q1 results despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. We went into the year with strong momentum and through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were still able to deliver 10 percentage points CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth in Q1, supported by double-digit growth in the U.S. and international in spite of impacts from China in the early part of the quarter, from Italy in early March, and then for much of Europe and North America shortly thereafter. Instrument placements were excellent in Q1 resulting in sustained year over year levels of Catalyst EBI. Our catalyst installed base grew 10% in North America and 25% internationally with the overall premium instrument installed base increasing 15%. We developed a new remote installation process for instruments, which also supported placements in impacted regions. The IDEXX Preventive Care program enrollments also achieved record levels with approximately 400 new enrollees and more than 4,200 cumulative enrollments since program inception. This was accomplished despite late quarter impacts from COVID-19. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution in record numbers and increasingly view it as a foundational element of their care offering. Though we expect in some cases for implementation to take a bit longer due to COVID-19 impacts, the IDEXX Preventive Care program will be a key element of what we and our customers see as a recover-together plan for North America. Our product innovations announced at VMX were launched on schedule and were enthusiastically greeted by customers. Our digital cytology placements starting in early March were primarily sold to larger IDEXX customers via our IDEXX 360 program. Customers are enthusiastic about our test promise, results, and expert interpretation in under two hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Catalyst Bile Acids with Reference Lab quality performance was also launched in the quarter. We are pleased with the adoption to date with over 340 customers. SediVue Neural Network 5.0 updates began rolling out in March and advanced bacteria detection kits starting to ship in April. Our innovation highlights also included the announcement in Q1 that we would begin monitoring clinically symptomatic pets for COVID-19 infection. We then announced in April that we would offer this test commercially throughout the world based on a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cats, experiments that demonstrated the susceptibility of cats and ferrets, and veterinarian demands for testing option. We expect this veterinary test to not have an impact on human COVID-19 testing or test availability. Additionally, the company's human health business OPTI Medical Systems is advancing support of human COVID-19 testing with a validated PCR test kit enabled by IDEXX's expertise in livestock PCR, test development and manufacturing. It is intended for limited initial distribution to existing customers, including labs serving animal production needs that have been repurposed for human COVID-19 testing. Moving to software, we saw excellent ongoing momentum in our software business, which I will speak to later, with over 10% growth in PIMS placements in North America, record orders for SmartFlow and with now over 4,800 customers on Web PACS subscriptions. Moving to a quick update on our European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. We have begun testing and it remains on track to transition by the end of Q2. We are excited by the world-class capabilities in this facility, which is 50% larger than our next biggest lab will bring to our European Reference Lab customers. Our team has done an amazing job to stay on track despite the pandemic. Finally, our Water and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy businesses, both performed solidly in Q1. Demand for livestock diagnostics testing is also considered essential and we are seeing sustained solid demand in our LPD business. Brian highlighted some of the dynamics we are seeing in the market and our testing volumes from COVID-19. Next I will discuss how we are managing in this environment, helping our customers and positioning ourselves for the future. Let's start with how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the IDEXX workplace and employee safety. Approximately 60% of our employees are now working from home. We have invested heavily and in telephony and IT infrastructure over many years, so that we were able to transition a majority of our employees home without missing a beat. Still other jobs require employees to be on site like those in manufacturing, distribution and the Reference Labs. We have instituted practices at these locations to minimize risk like staggered shifts or frequent and deeper cleaning and local social distancing procedures. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Not only have we launched products on schedule, like the previously mentioned digital cytology service, Catalyst Bile Acids and advanced bacteria detection for SediVue, but we continue to advance our product pipeline, as our teams are adapting to the new circumstances in highly creative ways. Moving to how veterinary practices are being impacted. They are experiencing similar challenges as other businesses based on client visits. The good news is that veterinary practice has been designated as essential businesses throughout the U.S. and in almost all countries. The vast majority are open and operating, and we are still performing essential services for their clients caring for sick and injured pets in need of attention. Demand for other services, including wellness visits and elective activities have slowed due to government policies and guidance from veterinary organizations designed to control COVID-19 spread. Though our veterinary customers are consequently seeing fewer patient visits at this point, volumes impacted are in line with the aggressiveness of social distancing procedures. Many services are only deferred, and we believe we will return relatively quickly as in past downturns once the recovery begins. We believe the bond between people and their companion animal family members is as strong as ever. As Brian noted, we have seen dampened demand relatively more in our Reference Lab business versus testing in the clinic. This is related in part to fewer preventive care visits versus those involving a sick patient. Further, practices like all businesses are also concerned with workplace and employee safety. They have instituted practices like curbside drop off and pickup, remote check in and bill pay, along with the creation of modified shifts for veterinary staff to ensure care team well-being and continuity for clients. Our field service organization has played an important role helping customers make these required adjustments to their practice workflow in this new COVID-19 environment. IDEXX sales professionals have also adjusted well to this dynamic, continuing to generate demand for our products and services. Virtual visits than our standard can be highly sophisticated. Our sales professionals are using tools like WebEx for demos and DocuSign to bring pipeline deals across the line. We also continue to visit practices when requested by a customer and with an appointment, abiding by necessary safety procedures. Our in-person availability has been welcomed by customers and in April, constituted about 25% of total U.S. visits. Veterinarians look to business partners at all times, but even more so now to have sufficient product supply on hand and be able to supply services like Reference Lab testing in an uninterrupted manner. They want to focus on their businesses and now that their partners can handle theirs. IDEXX has performed exceptionally well in this regard and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future. Our manufacturing operations are largely based in the U.S. and we have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our Reference Lab performance has been especially noteworthy in light of the disrupted flight schedules, challenging logistics and more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employee safe. With over 80 labs worldwide, not unexpectedly, there have been a handful of instances where it needed to temporarily shut a facility for a short time due to an employee being or suspected of being infectious. Because of our network lab capability across regions and geographies, we were able to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption or deterioration. These capabilities are unique in the industry and only possible because we have made significant investments over a very long period of time in lab density, common lab's information management systems, and courier route and logistics capability. We also deployed a global lab digital cytology service in the middle of all of this, another example of global agility and advantage. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. Our expansion in the U.S. was completed going into Q1 and the team seamlessly settled into the new territories and account assignments. Our account managers continue to call on customers with similar frequency, but now the majority of visits are virtual. Our European commercial team continues to mature in the VDC model and is also performing at a high level. We entered into the year with record customer loyalty across modalities and all actions taken to date have been taken with the long-term view to continue to earn this loyalty for years to come. IDEXX veterinary software and services are also playing an important customer enabling role in this pandemic. Right now, customers are being forced to rethink how they deliver patient care, and IDEXX's software solutions both new and existing to help them adapt. The IDEXX telehealth offering includes a multiple third-party -- includes multiple third-party telehealth integrations into our global PIMS offering, 90-day free secure remote access for our Cornerstone customers, the ability to use SmartFlow through an iPad from their parking lot for curbside check-in, and contactless payment processing integrated with their IDEXX PIMS. These capabilities enable customers to deliver remote care, as well as continue to see patients in their practices while abiding by social distancing guidelines. We also believe that in the medium term, telehealth can expand demand for diagnostics, the deeper pet owner client connections enabled by real time, convenient communications that millennial pet owners expect and pet owners of all ages appreciate. Further, telehealth has a potential to expand patient access, especially for cats, who comprise only approximately 20% of practice visits today. Next, I will share a snapshot view of the health of the business. There are broad macroeconomic uncertainties as to the depth and length of the impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, our focus has been on what we can control in our plans for recovery. We took quick and deliberate action to prudently control costs, while leaving us well-positioned for future growth. These include a temporary salary reduction, reductions in our essential business and capital expenses and a cessation of stock buybacks. Our intent is to seize those reductions that are temporary like salary reductions as conditions improve. Critically, these actions were taken in ways that allow us to preserve the considerable strategic advantages, talent and organizational engagement we have as a company. Our financial strength has allowed us to support veterinarians at a time when they need us most, and I believe they will reward our approach with their business long into the future. We have taken practical actions which extend payment terms for customers who need it, as well as to provide near term flexibility for minimum commitments, while maintaining these long-term diagnostic partnership agreements with customers. Customers have given us and will continue to give us as much testing volume as possible. Our focus is therefore to support the health of their practices and allow them to focus on delivering excellent medical care in a challenging environment and when the time comes, support them as they quickly rebuild client traffic. We participate in great markets. Nothing has changed in this regard due to COVID-19 social distancing practices that have temporarily limited veterinary visits. If anything, pet owners have become even more attached to their companions as they spend even more time with them at home. Pet adoptions and fostering at an all-time high and breeders in many instances report waiting list of 12 or more months. And most importantly, pets still need to go to the veterinarian and most pet owners do not consider these visits to be discretionary. Diagnostics will continue to play a central and growing role in the care of the patient, as well as practice health. Many practices have seen accelerating impact from e-tailers gains in online sales of food and medicine. This is business that is not likely to come back at the same levels. Veterinarians will continue to look for practice categories like diagnostics that are medically necessary, drive the care envelope and almost always best done in the practice. Our belief is that as a result of pent-up demand from COVID-19, which has constrained care that is desired and needed, though perhaps not time critical, veterinary practices might experience a stronger V-shape recovery than the vast majority of other market segments. We see some early evidence of this in select markets like China and Australia and regions within the U.S. where these markets have begun to relax strict shelter at home policies. Practices will be in good shape to meaningfully take up where they left off, though they have reduced hours and furloughed employees in some instances, we believe that there isn't structural damage to the industry or the balance sheet of practice owners. As practices rebuild client traffic with a focus on wellness care, we will be there with our strategic advantages fully impact. We are using this time wisely, continuing to advance our product pipeline, strengthen relationships and provide exceptional day-to-day service. Unique capabilities that we bring are now even more widely appreciated and keep in mind that this is a highly resilient business with a history of outperforming in economic recovery periods. While these are difficult times, they are an important reminder of our company purpose and that what we do makes a big difference in the lives of pets, people and livestock. I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the team for their extraordinary support during this period. Now, we will take questions. Sure. I will cover some of the high level, high level thinking and philosophy behind us and then Brian may want to talk through some of the specifics in terms of how we were thinking about that. We have a great business. We have a great organization. We really approach shifts with the idea that we want to, that we are going to come out of this that we are going to come out of this strong with the market. The pet owners love their pets that they believe that taking their pets to that veterinarians and getting testing is the right thing to do. We know that the veterinarians believe that testing is good medicine and uncovers disease. And so we wanted to approach this in a way that allows us to maintain all of our strategic advantages. These are advantages that we have built up, not just a year or two, but over decades. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, 80 plus Reference Labs, common labs, information management systems, courier route, service levels that are exceptional including weekends. We don't want to lose any of that capability. We don't want to -- we want to be able to continue to execute our product roadmap, maintain high engagement in the organization, continue to deliver exceptional service levels, make sure that we have supply when customers need it. And most importantly, if you take a look at our customer facing organizations maintaining full staff levels and being able to continue to serve customers is even more importantly. So we did this in a way that we think it was prudent that maintains engagement that the organization understands and responded to positively and so that as we come out of this, all of these strategic advantages, organizational capability, and engagement remain intact. So, Brian do you want to address that. Thanks for the question, Erin. Yeah. We have always said that our markets that have historically been very competitive. It's no different now, even if it's within the COVID-19 environment. They continue to be very competitive. We are very pleased with the way -- with the inroads that we continue to make in terms of, if you take a look at the competitive catalyst placements globally, we were up 17% premium installed base year-over-year, 15%. We continue to expand Reference Lab testing. The point-of-care solutions like VetLab have held up relatively well in the COVID-19 environment. Now part of that is due to the fact that they support more sick patient testing with real time results. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, before the COVID-19 impact, we were at a solid middle teens in the U.S. from a growth standpoint, high single-digits internationally. So we did see some drop-off in volume in line with the visits and prioritizing case management, as Brian described it. But we have also seen even now, with the drop-off and the beginnings of a recovery that customers have a new appreciation, a far deeper appreciation for what we are bringing in terms of service levels, lab network, density, courier, logistics, all of those things. And I think what they are seeing from some other participants in the marketplace is they don't have that capability in that footprint to be able to provide that level of service. Yeah. So from -- in Q1, we continue to realize modest price realization of between 2% and 3%. Relative to future pricing dynamics, we are certainly not going to forecast that today. The thing that I would point out is that customers don't just think about price per se. They look at price within the context of overall value from what they get. We are always pressure testing the economics within that value construct. In terms of actually the programs themselves, we do have volume. We do have volume-based commercial programs and in some cases we are making allowances for rebalancing obligations where programs, just I think reflect the reality that there is some reduced client traffic in testing volumes and what to be able to support our customers through that. Yeah. I will share with you, Jon, a couple of things we are hearing from veterinarians. Let me focus on and well this that because to your point, if the patient is sick and or needs a surgery, they have obviously still have the opportunity to do that. If you take at look at Q1, we had a record number of preventive care enrollments in the first quarter, 400. So, that puts the overall program at 4,200 to-date, as I indicated earlier. But the important thing about preventative care, just as a category, is pet owners see that as something that's not discretionary, something that they truly prioritize for their pet. And more and more what practice owners in veterinarians are telling us is not only do they consider this is good medicine because it uncovers more and drives the care above. It's important to their practice economics. It is important to client engagement. So I see it from both the medical necessity and practice health standpoint. So, they are chomping at the bit. That speaks to what Brian had indicated, where we are relatively optimistic around sort of this pent-up demand and more of a V-shaped recovery. It's part of our -- it's going to be part of our recovery strategy, Recover Together strategy to emphasize that. There's still tons of work to do on sick patient testing in addition to preventative care. So we are relatively optimistic. Yeah. I mean just that -- just a couple of observations. Yeah. The first couple of weeks, veterinary practices, they may struggle to adapt workflow. I mean, partly it was drop off in visits, but partly as you describe it, the extent -- they had to extend appointment blocks, and it was more challenging for them. That we worked with customers through our field service organization to be able to help them design new workflows in terms of curbside drop off and pick up, and remote check in and contactless payment processes. They have gotten much better at it, just like you would expect that over time you begin to optimize your processes. So, different states, different regions are in different stages of recovery and so initially it was only from the parking lot. I think over time, we will see that relaxation. Yeah, there is a point that I would make just tying together your two questions is that when you take a look at what's happened within the practices, with the e-tailers and a lot of product sales, both food and medicines going online. The -- a lot of that business is not going to return at least at the same levels that they experienced before. That's going to put even more focus on getting the patient into the practice, having checkups using diagnostics. So, again, we will see how this develops over time, but I think all the trends are positive. Yeah. I mean, it's really comes out with the fact that, even within this COVID-19 environment, we are still highly engaged with our customers. Our customer facing folks are our visiting customers 75% just take the U.S. for example is virtual, but 25% when requested were present and fully decked out and its safety care. So there is a high level of engagement. We are building pipeline. We are working with -- our customers in terms of developing strategies that as we recover they rebuild client traffic. We saw coming out of the great recession in 2009 that a lot of really good our clients or pet owners returned almost immediately. Where the veterinarian's I think need it needed some help and assistance is for those relatively new clients to help build the muscle memory of semi-annual or annual visits. So we are looking at programs that we have for example our preventive care program is perfect for that. And even the sick patient visits are allowed are advised, there are still some things that people are likely pet owners and likely deferring. So we are looking at all of our programs to be able to support that. Just one word on the IDEXX 360, because it's really tailor-made for this type of environment. Yeah, if you think about IDEXX 360 you are able to get capital purchases with zero money down. So if you are veterinary practice if you are in this constrained environment from an economic standpoint, you can still purchase instruments and you pay on a monthly basis and you are able to match invoicing to the customer with testing volumes. So in some ways it's really tailor-made to test for this type of environment. So we are looking at all of those things in terms of how to support customers. Yeah. So we have developed and validated a human real-time PCR test for COVID-19 and really to your question, we leveraged the capability we have in OPTI, which is our human health business from a regulatory standpoint and channels, but also our experience in developing and manufacturing livestock infectious disease kits in our current business. So this is a test, it is a PCR test. It is highly effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity from a performance standpoint. Results -- you typically get results in well under four hours, so it's fairly quick, and we have used, OPTI is used or is in a process of using the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization process. We are waiting for approval, as well as we have applied for CE Mark in the European Union. And so we are advancing our ability to manufacture these in our Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy business, and really targeting for initial distribution existing IDEXX customers. So not necessarily using external channel, so these include things like livestock, laboratories, public health laboratory, state CDC labs, stuff entities like that. Yeah. So let me -- I will answer that question in a couple of levels, because you had mentioned the recessionary environment and the resilience of the business, which is absolutely true. When you take a look at the great recession in 2009, we performed extremely well growing 5%, coming out of the trough of that and if you now, we say, 10 years later, we are even I think better positioned to be able to perform strongly in a V-shaped recovery. So you think about the business as a whole. we are extremely well diversified, geography across businesses like CAG, Water, livestock, poultry and dairy across different modalities and plus lots of shapes. So just a couple of things that I would emphasis, which includes our commercial organization with, if you take a look at a decade ago, we were represented primarily through distributors and now we have more direct representation and so we are not reliant on others. I think the fact that our portfolio is far broader and includes sick and some of the wellness pieces that you emphasized. And I think the role of diagnostics is far more appreciated and how important it is and really how it feeds into not only good medical care but practice health. In terms of the component of diagnostics over the recent couple of weeks and what that looks like. Not sure we have visibility to that data yet. That's something that we will continue to look at on a weekly basis in terms of both lab accessions as well as the smart service, what the testing piece is, but still too early to comment specifically on that question. I'm sorry, I missed that part where you said the number of what visits pick back. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Absolutely. The way we conduct visits today is when customers ask us to be present or that differs than a lot of other companies out there that have essentially 100% virtual visit policy. So if you take a look at April, for example, 25% of the visits of the field organization was actually physically visiting the practice. Now, if you break that down by states and regions, it did differ based on the how strict the social distancing procedures were in the practice. What we saw in places like Texas and the South relatively more visits, relatively higher visit levels in terms of clients and more testing. Impacted - higher impacted regions like the Northeast and the Great Lakes, for example, a bit lower. So, very much in line and proportional to what the local guidelines are per se per region. I mean, I would just also again reemphasize the IDEXX 360 program is ideal in many respects for new customer acquisition and its environment. No cash outlays matching customer invoices with the use of consumables. And the other thing David is we are able to calibrate future commitment expectations for customers in terms of how we use this. So, I think, we all recognize that this is a unique environment and we can highly configure these type of volume commitment programs for that environment. Yeah. Let me -- yeah. There is a couple of questions in that. Let me just address the question around or the point you made around second catalyst placements at practices. These tend to go to higher volume customers. So it's not like we are placing a second catalysts and it's just sitting there. I mean, the reason they may want a second catalyst as they are growing their practice, growing client visits. It is a highly modular system. So this represents a real volume driven decision on the part of customers. We think from a recovery standpoint, as well as longer term trends. The diagnostics utilization will continue to be robust for sick patient, preventive care, menu offering our product roadmap and the different assays we are launching continue to drive, continue to drive usage, continue to drive utilization, though it's somewhat lower now because of this environment. We think that all the dynamics and all sort of the value drivers are still intact. So we don't expect through the recovery for that to change. So here's I would -- here's how at least we think about it, Mike. Customers have always been concerned with the economics of the solution. I mean that hasn't changed. Price is a component of it. The value that we deliver is the other component of it. And as I indicated, we are always testing to make sure that the value and economics line up. From a customer standpoint, what we work to do through our programs is to make sure that based on their environment and based on the circumstances, we provide the appropriate program that allows them to purchase what they think are the best tools and allow them to deliver the best medicine. From that standpoint, nothing has changed in terms of our solutions and what they perceive to be the best solutions for their needs. And as I indicated, we have programs that allow them to get that, get the products, get the service offerings they want and do it in a way that works for them, works from an economic standpoint and matches and aligns the invoices that they collect or charge to the client and what they have to in turn pay us. So we are confident that we can continue to meet their dates and do it in a way that's economically sensitive to the environment. And with that, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call and I'd like to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance there in these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that both delivers the day and takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business. I couldn't be more proud of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial performance in Q4 driven by double digit top line gains compared to very strong prior year results. Revenue increased 11% as reported and 10.5%, organically supported by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Two year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues was approximately 17% across U.S. and international regions, consistent with the accelerated two year growth trends seen throughout 2021. We achieved record premium instrument placements in Q4 with strong gains across our major platforms supporting a 14% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Strong revenue growth enabled delivery of $1.89 and EPS up 12% on a comparable basis as we advanced planned investments in our commercial and innovation capability. Closer benefits from high organic revenue growth in 2021 drove outstanding full year financial performance above our long term goals. IDEXX achieved 16% overall organic revenue growth for the full year, driven by 18% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 29%, an increase of 220 basis points on a comparable basis. And we delivered full year EPS of $8.60 per share up 29% on a comparable basis. We're well-positioned to build on the strong financial performance in 2022. We're targeting revenue gains at the higher end of our long term goals reflected in our outlook for 10% to 12% overall organic revenue growth and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. We're also targeting a 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, building on the strong profit gains through the pandemic as we continue to invest towards the long term development of companion animal healthcare globally. Our EPS outlook of $9.27 to $9.59 per share, reflects 12% to 16%, comparable EPS growth, including an estimated $0.15 per share, or 2% EPS growth impact related to higher projected international tax rates. We'll discuss our 2022 financial outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 10.5% was driven by 13% overall CAG gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, reflecting comparisons to high prior year results that benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $5 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing revenues. Strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflected 13% organic gains across U.S. and international regions, compared to 21% organic growth levels in the fourth quarter of 2020. Strong Q4 CAG results were also supported by 21% gains in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from a recent ezyVet acquisition. For the full year 2021 overall CAG revenues increased 19% organically driven by 18% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting high gains across our major modalities and regions. Strong U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter was aided by solid year-on-year gains in clinical visits and continued positive demand trends which are supporting high levels of clinical revenue growth at the practice level. Same-store U.S. clinical visit growth was 2.2% in Q4, compared to high prior year growth levels. On a two year basis U.S. same-store clinical visits increased at 5.5% with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. An increased focus on healthcare services including diagnostics supported an 8% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4 and nearly 10% gains in clinical diagnostic revenues which increased 14% on an average two year basis. Expanding demand for clinical services and benefits from IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement supported a 1050 basis point premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to U.S. clinical visit growth in the quarter. In terms of practice level trends, we did see some modest impact from the recent Omicron wave on clinical testing volumes in international regions in Q4 which has continued in early 2022. We've also seen some moderation in clinic visit growth in January in the U.S. including near term impacts from higher COVID cases on practice level staffing. We're monitoring these dynamics which we don't see as indicative of changes in strong underlying demand trends. Globally, IDEXX achieved strong organic gains across our major testing modalities in Q4 resulting in exceptional full year growth results. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 12% organically in Q4 reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and high single digit organic growth in international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Referenced lab gains continue to be driven by solid same-store volume growth including benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements. For the full year 2021 global lab revenues increased 70% organically reflecting consistent high gains across U.S. and international regions. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 15% on an organic basis in Q4 reflecting double digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Strong consumable growth reflects increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. These dynamics supported 20% full year organic growth at IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2021. IDEXX had another quarter of outstanding instrument placements building on this momentum. We achieved 5,258 premium instrument placements in Q4 up 29% from prior year levels, reflecting robust gains across U.S. and international regions. We achieved strong global placement growth across our major platforms year-on-year with catalyst up 8%, SediVue up 20% and premium hematology up 72% supported by the continued global rollout of ProCyte One. The breadth and quality of CAG instrument placements supported strong gains in our economic value metric. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels drove a 14% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2021 setting a foundation for continued strong consumable growth as we move forward. Rapid assay revenue increased 10% organically in Q4 reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S. aligned with broader increases in demand for diagnostic testing and high growth in international regions. For the full year 2021 Rapid Assay organic revenue growth was 17% supported by high volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven augmented by moderate net price improvement of approximately 3% in key regions like the U.S. Looking ahead to 2022 we're planning for net price improvement in the range of 3% to 4% reflecting higher list price increases to reflect higher service costs, and continued investment in service quality and product innovation. In other areas of our CAG business our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 30% as reported in Q4 including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Continued strong gains and recurring software and diagnostic imaging services and high comparable growth in PIMS placements were moderated to a degree by tough compares related to strong prior year diagnostic imaging placements. For the full year 2021 veterinary, software and diagnostic imaging revenues expanded to over $200 million up 15% organically and 27% as reported as we continue to advance integration of information technology and insight as a key feature of our diagnostic solutions. Turning to other business segments, water revenues increased 13% organically in Q4 compared to flat organic growth in last year's fourth quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. For the full year 2021 water revenues increased 12% organically compared to a 2% organic decline in 2020. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 90% organically in Q4 compared to 13% organic growth levels in Q4 of 2020. As expected dynamics in our China LPD business including the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing, offset growth and other global regions. For the full year 2021 LPD revenues declined 9% organically compared to 11% gains in 2020. We're planning for continued challenging year-on-year compares and LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 which is factored into our overall revenue outlook. Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth drove solid operating profit gains compared to strong prior levels as we advanced plan investments aligned with our growth strategy. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis in Q4 driven by continued solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth at a modest overall increase in gross margins. We benefited from continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, moderate net price improvement, and higher veterinary software margins, including positive impacts from or expanding SaaS customer base. These factors were moderated by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth, and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. Operating expenses increased 15% on a reported and comparable basis in Q4. As planned, we saw relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we advanced investments in R&D, enhanced our global CAG sales and marketing capability and integrated the ezyVet acquisition. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth in 2022 aligned with our strong global growth momentum. Operating expense investments drove a 70 basis point contraction in comparable operating margins in Q4. For the full year 2021 our operating margins reached 29% up 220 basis points on a comparable basis for the year and up approximately 560 basis points on a comparable basis from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We're targeting to build on the strong performance in 2022 as we invest towards the high return, long term growth potential in our business. Q4 EPS was $1.89 per share, including $0.08 per share a tax benefit related to share based compensation activity. For the full year 2021 EPS was $8.60 up 29% on a comparable basis. Full year EPS results included $32 million or $0.38 per share in tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, which provided 360 basis points of effective tax rate benefits. Foreign exchange effects reduced revenue growth by approximately 1% in Q4 resulting in a $0.02 per share profit impact net of a hedged loss of approximately $500,000. For the full year 2021 foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.16 per share net of foreign exchange hedge losses of $7 million. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar we're planning for 1.5% FX revenue growth headwind in 2022 with approximately 2% to 2.5% year-on-year growth headwinds in the first half. Well, previously established hedge positions will mitigate these impacts on profits, our initial 2022 outlook incorporates an estimated $0.08 net unfavorable EPS impact from the FX at the rates noted in our press release. Free cash flow was $636 million for 2021 or approximately 85% of net income reflecting a $120 million in capital spending including $18 million in real estate purchases. We maintained a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $144 million in cash at the end of the year. In Q4 we established a new five year $1 billion revolving credit facility which provides relatively improved borrowing rates. Our 2022 interest expense outlook incorporate these benefits, current forward interest rates and expectations for a net leverage ratio of one times next year. In Q4, we allocated $245 million to repurchase 391,000 shares in the quarter. We plan to continue to allocate capital to share repurchases as part of our financial approach which is reflected in a projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in our diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2022. Turning towards 2022 outlook we are providing initial guidance for reported revenues of 3.5 billion to 3.565 billion. This outlook reflects a targeted organic revenue growth range of 10% to 12%, carryover benefits of approximately 0.5% from 2021 acquisitions and an estimated 1.5% revenue growth headwind from FX. Our organic growth outlook reflects an estimated growth range of 12% to 14% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. The higher end of this range aligns with sustaining the strong year-on-year growth trends we achieved exiting 2021 and incorporates additional targeted benefits for a moderately higher net price realization and investments in global CAG sector development. Our overall organic growth outlook also factors in continued benefits from expansion of our premium instrument installed base and solid growth in our water business. These positive factors are partially offset by expectations for continued year-on-year pressure on LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 and a projected contraction in human PCR testing revenues reflecting our overall strategic growth focus on our core businesses. Our reported operating margin outlook for full year 2022 is 29.7% to 30.2% reflecting a targeted 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement building on our strong operating margin gains in recent years. We expect operating margin improvement will be supported by solid gross margin gains as we advanced investments in our global commercial and innovation capability and ensure high levels of operational business continuity as a priority. We've incorporated anticipated inflationary cost impacts, as well as benefits from relatively higher net price gains in our overall operating margin outlook. Given exit rates in our OpEx spending and year-on-year operating profit comparison dynamics, we're planning for operating margin improvements to be primarily driven by gains in the second half of 2022. Our preliminary EPS outlook for 2022 is $9.27 to $9.59 per share an increase of 8% to 11% as reported. Our EPS outlook factors in effect -- it increase in our overall effective tax rate from 17.5% to an estimated 21.5% to 22% in 2022. Approximately 100 to 150 basis points of this increase relates to projected impacts from international tax changes. We're also projecting lower tax benefits from share based tax compensation activity. Our EPS outlook reflects projected 2022 stock based compensation tax benefits of $10 million or approximately $0.12 per share compared to high realized 2021 tax benefits of $32 million or $0.38 per share. As noted, we've also incorporated an estimated year on year negative impact of $0.8 per share from FX, net of establish hedge positions. Adjusting for these factors our outlook is for EPS growth of 12% to 16% on a comparable basis, including an estimated $0.15 per share approximately 2% EPS growth impact from international tax rate changes. Our 2022 free cash flow outlook was for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 75% to 80%. This reflects estimated capital spending of 180 million or approximately 5% of revenues, including $50 million related to a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion aligned to support our high growth. Adjusting for this major project, our normalized net income to free cash flow conversion ratio is aligned with our longer term 80% to 90% targets. That concludes our financial view. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian. And good morning. IDEXX sustained a strong performance in Q4 capping an exceptional year for the company. For the full year we delivered 16% organic revenue growth, 29% comparable EPS growth supported by solid operating margin games and 59% ROI fee. These results reflect the attractiveness of our businesses including our core CAG business which is sustaining very strong growth trends benefiting from our commercial expansion in an expanding innovation portfolio. We're well-positioned to build on this momentum in 2022 as reflected in our financial outlook. This morning I'll recap our recent performance and highlight key areas of business focus moving forward including advancement of new innovations in the ongoing expansion of our global commercial capabilities. Both of these are strategic elements of our plan to develop the substantial long term market opportunity still before us. Let me begin with a brief update on sector trends. Overall global companion animal healthcare trends remain strong driven by ongoing robust demand at veterinary clinics for healthcare services, including diagnostics. As Brian highlighted U.S. same-store clinical revenues increased 8% in Q4 supported by 2% growth in same-store clinical visits compared to very strong prior year growth levels. Diagnostic same-store growth continues to expand at a higher pace of nearly 10%. IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth is leading this expansion reflected in 13% organic gains in Q4 building on 21% gains in Q4 of 2020 as we provide highly desired diagnostics and information management platforms that support our customers care mission. We're seeing sustained strong demand transfer clinic, clinical service globally, building on the step up achieved through the pandemic. As highlighted and data shared in our earning snapshot this includes sustained approximately 2% acceleration in U.S. diagnostics revenue per clinical visit in 2021 building on higher 2020 gains. The solid momentum gives us confidence in investing towards accelerated global CAG sector development and is reflected in our outlook of 12% to 14% global CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in 2022 at the high end of our long term goals. Like many sectors of the global economy veterinary clinics continue to work through the challenging dynamic of increased clinical demand in the face of staffing challenges including near term management impacts from the surge of the Omicron variant. It's clear that strong clinical service demand will be a priority for clinics moving forward. IDEXX remains committed and extremely well-positioned to support the growth of our customers through our focus on high customer service levels and solutions that enhance clinic productivity. As we look forward, we're expanding our global commercial capability aligned with the strong demand trends. Our investments in Germany, France and South Korea in the first half of 2021 continue to pay off as expanded commercial footprints in each country enabled significant increases in customer contacts and reach to revenue critical elements of our high touch and account management philosophy. We're tracking towards completion in early 2022 of the already communicated second wave of expansions in three additional countries with more to come. These are holistic initiatives that only involve the addition of customer facing professionals across multiple job types such as account managers, professional service veterinarians, and field service representatives but also include the extension of marketing programs and new field tools such as IDEXX 360 and the addition of more extensive reference of [core] roots and expanded service levels. Increasing our international commercial footprint while maturing our approach will continue to be a key priority beyond wave two countries currently nearing completion. To that end, I'm pleased to share that we are also augmenting our commercial leadership team with an experienced commercial executive in Asia-Pacific CAG, who will join that excess quarter. As we expand, our commercial team continues to deliver the day reflected in over 5000 premium instrument placements in Q4 by far our largest quarterly placements ever achieved. Premium instrument placement growth of 29% includes comparable growth across U.S. and international regions, and resulted in 14% growth in our global premium install base with strong performance across each of our instrument platforms. These exceptional results were delivered despite excess challenges. They demonstrate strong commercial execution as well as the fact that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX innovations to support increased clinical demand today, while investing for future business needs. ProCyte One is a great example of this. Our ProCyte One launch has done exceptionally well. ProCyte One's performance and reliability is used for the demanding environment of a practice has met or exceeded all goals and feedback remains highly positive as customers love it\u2019s easy to use and how it fits into the veterinary clinic workflow. We see mid 90% global attach rates with chemistry analyzers in this trend demonstrate ProCyte One's importance in building a full diagnostic workup. Furthermore, the ProCyte One launch benefits from programs like IDEXX 360, which not only provides veterinarians with a flexible, customer friendly way to add this innovative analyzer to their clinics, but also benefits growth across IDEXX testing modalities. Our global ProCyte One regional [route] is now nearly complete and we have delivered over 2500 instruments globally since launching in late Q1 of 2021. A growing installed base of premium instruments supports a robust range of future consumable usage, which gives us confidence and guided ranges for CAG recurring revenue growth. In addition to driving placements and adoption. Our commercial team continues to educate our customers on the benefits of preventive medicine. The preventive care initiative remains our primary vehicle for driving a preventive agenda in the clinic, and provide sales professionals an opportunity to engage in thorough conversations with broad participation from practice staff. Despite restricted access to clinics, we drove approximately 125 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter while also developing plans to simplify the enrollment process for busy customers. And we look forward to deploying this and continuing to support this broader preventive care effort in 2022. We also see continued momentum in software expansion as our innovative products helping customers improve clinic efficiency and pet owner communication. The onboarding of ezyVet has gone very smoothly and subscriptions are tracking favorably to our high expectations. Customers appreciate the advanced capabilities and intuitive workflow ezyVet provides. 81% of PIMS placements were cloud based in the quarter, demonstrating that we are well-positioned to support customers in their shift to the cloud. This trend provides a significant growth opportunity and excellent profit flow. It puts robust and easy to use information management products at the hands of our customers that enable them to focus on providing the highest levels of patient care enabled by diagnostics to improve health outcomes. Our software portfolio is a strategic area of investment and focus for IDEXX. Veterinarians have never been busier and have a deep need and appreciation for software solutions that are easy to use and built on contemporary technology stacks. They look to these solutions to support patient care, staff productivity and internal as well as pet owner communications. Our strategy is to bring enterprise PIM software solutions to our customers that work seamlessly with a broader set of business and clinical applications. Our own or third parties that veterinarians used to run their practices VetConnect PLUS diagnostics results clinical decision support and ordering portal is a great example of this. VetConnect PLUS was launched almost 10 years ago. It's integrated from a workflow standpoint in IDEXX in third party PIMs it is now being used in over 30,000 practices globally. Customers who use our software and diagnostic solutions together correlate with higher growth profiles supporting workflow optimization for our diagnostics testing platforms. Our diagnostic imaging business which includes our industry leading Web PAC software solution also experienced an excellent quarter, demonstrating the preference customers have for our premier low dose imaging solutions. Solid placements in the quarter supported full year placement growth of 35% and double digit year-over-year gains in recurring revenue. We also had strong growth in Web PAC subscriptions for Q4 up 18% versus the prior year and with continued customer retention rates and high 90% range growth in the installed base a profitable revenue stream and increased utilization of services have helped IDEXX webpacks become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. In addition to ensuring the successful rollout and adoption of these recent innovations, we were thrilled to launch a series of new product and service enhancements in BMX last month. Each of these innovations highlight IDEXX's commitment to continually invest in our service and product offerings with a particular focus on providing insights and decision making aids to help customers deliver a higher standard of patient care. These enhancements include an expanded oncology testing platform with additional tests that aid for veterinarians to better identify, stage, treat and monitor several prevalent cancer types and updated 4Dx plus tests with improved parameter performance for Anaplasma and the addition of clinical decision support 4Dx plus and neuro network 6.0 for SediVue which has now been trained on 800 million urine sediment images. Improving the performance of our products is central to our strategy and we're also supporting greater efficiency which helps drive higher adoption and customer satisfaction. Some examples; the new catalyst SDMA brings reagents onboard the test, reducing the number of steps to run the test and time to results while also reducing storage space and waste due to the removal of separate reagent comps. The improved VetConnect PLUS mobile app provides an enhanced user experience, improve the mobile capability and easier pet owner communication and finally coming later in 2022 our 4Dx plus test will allow for extended room temperature storage. The addition of these time saving technologies demonstrates our technology for life approach to product and services designs. Notably, the improved 4Dx Plus product represents our fifth update to the [indiscernible] product first launched in 1992. While this test already represents the gold standard for vector borne disease rapid testing, we remain focused on continuous improvement to support our customers in delivering improved pet health outcomes. Underpinning our strong business performance, it's a prioritized focus on providing continued high level service to our customers. A key element in achieving these service levels is consistent strong execution across our supply chain which we saw again in Q4 through high product availability and strong order turnaround times. In order to build this capability and support growth in the future, we plan to invest in 2022 in the expansion of our manufacturing footprint in lab capacity, while also maintaining strong frontline measures to support high service levels. And while we anticipate some inflationary dynamics in supply chain headwinds going forward, we've captured these impacts in our outlook, and believe we are well positioned to build upon our year end margins. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum and execution in our business and excited about our plans to build on our progress in 2022. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to say thanks to our employees for another top notch year end in pursuit of our purpose and service to our customers. The IDEXX organization remained highly focused on our customers\u2019 needs and continued to perform at a very high level during another dynamic and demanding year. The team's perseverance is seen both in the results highlighted this morning, as well as our high levels of engagement as a team. And I'm proud to be able to share today's excellent results on behalf of the whole team's hard work. That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you and now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great, thanks so much for the questions. I just want to get a little bit more color on the magnitude of impact you're seeing from Omicron to the near term results. So basically how much of a step down in visits are you seeing currently? And then maybe just following on that just kind of broader question, can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectation for vet visit growth as we look out to 2022 and we start to think about annualizing maybe more normalized comps that we've seen over the past few years. Thanks so much.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Chris. We haven't quantified it. We did see some impact on testing volumes in the international regions from Omicron, in late Q4. It primarily manifested itself in the modest drop off in some lab volumes. And this trend appears to be continuing just in early \u201822 January as it affects the U.S. clinical visit growth. The thing to keep in mind is the underlying customer demand is very strong. What vet practices tell us is that they're busy as they ever been in terms of forward booking. We're seeing month, two month forward booking of patients and [impediments] (ph) just trying to get into practices. So we think practices have a playbook in which to deal with this. We've all seen this movie a couple times at this point. They've done the curbside drop off and pickup. In some cases there's obviously some staffing issues that they're dealing with, we think that that\u2019s more of a temporary basis. And we're in a really good position also to be able to support them with our field service, organization and technology solutions that help them be more productive and manage that business.\nBrian McKeon: And to your question Chris our 12% to 14% organic growth outlook for CAG Dx recurring revenues assumes positive clinic visit growth in addition to strong performance, ongoing performance by our teams and helping to grow our revenues faster than that.\nChris Schott: And maybe just one really quick follow up. I know, last year, you talked about new instrument placement growth adding I think about a percent or so to overall revenue growth. Can you just elaborate on how you're thinking about new instrument placements and its contribution to 2022? Thanks so much.\nBrian McKeon: I'll let Jay talk to the color of the momentum that we have on instrument placements in our priorities. In terms of our outlook we didn't break it out, specifically what we're targeting continued strong placement growth. The revenue growth may lag the placement growth somewhat as we see the expansion of programs like IDEXX 360 and have some mix effects from higher growth in international markets, but we're targeting solid instrument year-on-year growth and that's factored into the overall guidance.\nJay Mazelsky: We saw record placements in Q4 of 2021 over 5,000 on the back of record hematology placements in catalyst and SediVue, pretty much across the board. And we think that that momentum will remain intact. Practices are clearly investing in technology to help them from a capacity standpoint. They are looking to us and our solutions that not just support the best standard of care but also support workflow and staff productivity and enable them to handle higher patient volumes.\nChris Schott: Okay. Thanks so much for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks so much. In the inflationary environment that we're in and you anticipate higher price realization in the 2022 guide. But can you quantify some of the offsetting factors, the higher input costs, labor freight, net net how are these dynamics impacting you from a margin perspective in 2022, just based on your guidance?\nBrian McKeon: So we are seeing some impacts selectively in our business. I think you highlighted some of the key drivers, but freight and distribution costs have been a factor. We are monitoring higher labor input costs. I think that's something that we anticipate will be something we'll need to manage effectively. And we have selective impacts in different parts of our business, but we do use electronic components and things of that nature. I think a lot of our focus, Erin is on making sure we have continued very high business continuity, reliability. So we're really pleased with that. We're at 99% and customer reliability and that's our primary focus. And so we do have some impacts and as you pointed out we have a relatively higher expectation for net margins improvement that helps to mitigate that and is reflective to a degree of that and enables us to support the solid operating margin improvements that we're targeting next year.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And then more of a philosophical question here. So bear with me, but bigger picture, thinking about broader animal health and more specifically diagnostic trends and while there will be an element of normalization here near term, just given the tough comps and barring any sort of Omicron volatility, but it does seem that you suggest that we are emerging from the pandemic at a faster underlying growth rate for companion animal diagnostics that may be pre-pandemic, over the longer term. Does this change how you're thinking about your five year outlook? And how are you thinking about some of those changes over the course of the pandemic that may be actually more structural in nature? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, I'll take that. Good morning, Erin. There is a couple of quick longer term trends that the pandemic probably accelerated that were in effect and if anything, as a result of new pet adoptions and the pivot within practices, the more service versus retail type product sales, I think have just accelerated as a result of the pandemic. Clearly as veterinarians focus on medical services and patient care diagnostics is a big piece of that I think they recognize that diagnostics is obviously a very high margin, very high profit center within their practices. And so I think the combination of more patients, pet owners wanting a higher standards of patient care, veterinarians pivoting to services and the role that diagnostic plays, have been important factors. And then you layer on top of that, our strategy as a company which both includes continuing to innovate both in terms of testing platforms and information management and our commercial strategy, which is a high touch model and being able to work with veterinarians to help them use these tools effectively both business and medical wise, I think we continue to see very strong trends that are higher than pre-pandemic.\nErin Wright: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin from BoA.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question. And congrats, Jay and Brian on the quarter and on solid guide. I want to ask about some of the new products and new initiatives you announced earlier this year at VMX or around VMX including the PetDx partnership slightly different than some of the things you've done in the past. And it does get to a point we've had questions from investors about in terms of additional testing modalities, additional opportunities beyond sort of what's already on the market. Could you talk about the oncology opportunity? Or if there's others beyond that that you're thinking of in terms of some of the untapped markets and diagnostics? How do you see this partnership playing out over next couple of years? And sort of -- of the things you highlighted earlier this year how meaningful is that a contributor to 2022 overall? Or is that more of a long term factor?\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. Good morning, Mike. Pet cancer is the most prevalent cause of death in dogs. So there are about 6 billion positive cases of cancer of dogs just in the U.S., it's very significant. And if you take a look, that I just did a high level in terms of the process by which the veterinarian diagnosis and treats, it's very complex. It's fragmented and there aren't a complete set of diagnostic tools to help support that. So we think that there is a longer term very attractive market opportunity to be able to help veterinarians navigate cancer diagnosis and treatment. So we're building off our expertise in cancer pathology, which is really more today geared towards cancer identification and then really trying to get across the continuum of care which is the identification and staging and treating in monitoring and bring solutions to that full value chain of care. So the partnerships we announced, we think bring best in class technology to support that process. We're excited by it. It's still early stages in terms of market development. So I think it's less about the revenue opportunity near term and more about supporting veterinarians and helping them navigate what's very complex and what is increasingly pet owner driven demand for these types of services. I think over time it's a quite attractive opportunity. We bring, I think credible technical expertise to be able to support the veterinarian through this and we're excited by what we've learned and continuing to build off those capabilities over time.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks. And then a follow up question on the guide again. The 12% to 14% recurrent revenue in CAG is very solid guide and relative to initial expectations, you touched on and you commented that you expect clinical visit growth in the market to be positive. And you stated price again, but could you talk about some of the other moving pieces there. Just trying to get at the bridge from that clinical visit growth to the CAG recurring revenues whether it's diagnostic frequency diagnostic utilization? Just sort of the CAG premium could help us bridge what are the moving pieces there? That'd be helpful.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, Mike. So I think the way to think about this as the as we were coming out of 2021 and clearly, we had a big step up in demand through the pandemic that we're confident that we can build off of that. So I think that's one key theme. And as you look at the calibrate this, the exit rate of our business in Q4 we had 13%, CAG DX recurring growth off that higher base. So we were entering the year with that kind of trajectory. And we see some positive drivers here. We're investing in international growth and feel good about the attraction and the potential there and we will have some incremental benefit from net pricing that we highlighted. And so the higher end of the range really reflects kind of building off of the momentum that we had I think to build on kind of Erin's question earlier, one of the metrics we share in our snapshot is just the average revenue per clinical visit in the inventor clinics in the U.S. and that increases Jay noted nearly 200 basis points from pre-pandemic levels from 4% to about 6%. So there's some underlying positive service trends here. And I think what you're seeing in our outlook is confidence that we can execute well, continue to execute well invest in ways that support that and if we can sustain that type of momentum we were, we think we can achieve those higher growth levels. And I think the lower end of the range really is more calibration going back towards more pre-pandemic type growth. It's not where we're necessarily projecting, but I think that that's a potential scenario as well. But all of this is building off of the higher demand. So it's some of this will come down to our execution. And I think things like Omicron or near term dynamics that we'll just need to manage through. As Jay mentioned, we don't see that as indicative of a longer term or an underlying demand issue. But the momentum on our business we feel very positive about and we're investing towards that. I think we've got a good strategy to keep building on that progress.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJon Block: Hey, guys, great. Good morning. Thanks. First question is on wellness, clinical visits. They can continue to do very well. The two year average actually accelerated from the third quarter 21 levels. So just love management spots on staffing capacity issues at vet practices, we continue to hear a lot about those. I think others do as well. Jay and Brian how difficult are they because you would think wellness would be impacted. But again, an accelerated and maybe you believe the underlying industry demand from consumers is actually potentially higher from what we're seeing work its way through and then I've just got a follow up. Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. John, in terms of the wellness visits, and a couple of things that are potentially driving that. Obviously there's a lot of puppies and kittens who have now become dogs and cats. And I think there's a lot of pet owners who want to get their pets into the practice and being checked up and there's been an emphasis on wellness visits in the U.S. now for quite some time. So it's not new. Obviously there are some capacity constraints in some of these visits get pushed off a month or six weeks. And I think over time, that'll get relieved, but I think the under what we see as the underlying demand for wellness and checkups, is there and have been very robust as you pointed out, and we expect that to be able to sustain. Certainly we and others in the market place, I really focused and emphasizing preventive care, as they an important part of patient health.\nJon Block: Okay, fair enough. And the second one, built on Chris's earlier question. So Brian, I'll try to maybe push you a little bit more. I think CAG DX recurring guide was, I think solid and a lot of people's view. It implies a two year average of in and around 15.5%. You helped I thought a lot on the cadence of OP margin expansion in 2022. You call that the comps with anything specifically to call out for CAG DX recurring to your average for 1Q? I mean, you got a wildly tough comp. You call that Omicron headwinds that persists. Jan, maybe even in February. Could this be a situation where we're looking at an organic revenue CAG DX of mid single digits when we take that all into account? Or maybe just phrase it, frame it versus that the two year average of 15.5 for full year? Thanks, guys.\nBrian McKeon: Look, the way I think we're thinking about this is we're building off this higher base. So we clearly had a period there where we needed to look at some two year metrics here to calibrate for 2020 effectively the pandemic dynamics. And now we're moving into sort of that phase of building off the higher base, I would say that there was some incremental benefit last year in Q4 from just the puppy boom and that I think is probably the key factor that sustains in the near term but for the most part we're normalizing off that hire base. And so I think that 12% to 14%, is that full year number one. We're not projecting by quarter, but I think we're that reflective of the overall momentum in the business. I think the Omicron dynamic is a near term dynamic in the U.S. that we didn't really see significantly in Q4. And then we're seeing some effects early here, what we'll sort that out as we go through the quarter, but I think the underlying momentum and trends we're targeting to remain strong and we'll work through these near term dynamics as they play out.\nJon Block: All right, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Brian, maybe starting with the OpEx guidance. I think you mentioned kind of the higher levels that you saw in the latter half of this year will continue into 2022. I guess it's kind of running in the back half of \u201821 was in the low 30% range in terms of revenue. Can you maybe talk about what you see the run rate being going forward both for 2022 and beyond because OpEx as a percent of revenue has come down a lot relative to historical levels? Do you see that getting back to historical levels are, you kind of feel like the current rate that we're adding is sort of what to expect as we go forward from here?\nBrian McKeon: So I think the way to think about Nathan is we had a Q4 growth rate year-on-year about 15% and we're working, still working through some compares to some relatively more controlled growth at OpEx levels in the comparable prior year. And so entering into Q1 we expect kind of the that same dynamic will have a relatively higher rate of OpEx that'll be our most challenging compare. And, in general terms, I think, for the full year, you should expect us to be trending back more in line with kind of our overall revenue growth where we want to lean in and invest towards future growth. I think our market dynamics will, as they've been in the past be supported by solid gross margin improvement. And so I think longer term consistent with our longer term outlooks that we've shared at Investor Day, I think OpEx grow closer to revenue growth is a reasonable expectation.\nNathan Rich: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Brian, I don't know if you have any commentary on how we should expect kind of the weighting of earnings this year between like the first half and the second half, just kind of given the commentary on kind of the early first quarter trends as well as the higher OpEx levels. Is that going to kind of significantly change the typical seasonality that you usually see in the business?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. It's more driven by compares than necessarily a change in seasonality, but I did mention that our margin improvement would be in the second half. And as we just discussed, I think are more challenging compare will be in Q1 in terms of the quarters this year, but that's again more reflective of year-on-year dynamic. The one thing to highlight specifically is we'll still be working through an LPD. We have the decline in the African swine fever revenues that really started in the third quarter of 2021. We'll still be working through those compares. So that'll have a dynamic as well.\nNathan Rich: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.\nNicholas Spiekhout: Hey guys, Nick Spiekhout in for Ryan, most of my question has been asked. But I guess in the release you mentioned, you're still working your way through the ezyVet integration at least on the OpEx side. I was wondering how far along are you in that until you kind of, fully integrate, and you're no longer dealing with those expenses?\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning. Yes the ezyVet integration has gone quite well, where we're far along in terms of really integrating our sales approach and organizations and product roadmaps. And that continues to received extremely well in the marketplace and the things from the growth numbers that there's a lot of traction behind that. It's a key part of our strategy and over 80% of our PIMs placements were cloud based placements this quarter. So really good traction far long in integration and going well.\nNicholas Spiekhout: Great, thanks. And I guess, kind of just a quick follow up on the wellness visit color. With kind of that strong stack wellness growth, I was wondering if you guys are seeing any change in the proportion of those that have included a 10 panel like with a large growth are you seeing that kind of proportion come down are you kind of maintaining what the historical rate was with that growth?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, I mean, it's been pretty constant in terms of panel mix. It's something we don't break out. These are largely configured panels for wellness. So when customers use that get a lot of variation quarter-to-quarter. And so with that, I'd like to thank everybody for joining this morning's call. I know we have some employees who are listening. I would like to say thank you to them for their excellent performance and continued passion for our purpose. Day in and day out, our team delivered excellent results aligned to our long term opportunity while also demonstrating unwavering commitment to our purpose in navigating and evolving landscape through the continued pandemic impacts. Very grateful for the IDEXX team, and the purpose which drives our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial performance in Q4 driven by double digit top line gains compared to very strong prior year results. Revenue increased 11% as reported and 10.5%, organically supported by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Two year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues was approximately 17% across U.S. and international regions, consistent with the accelerated two year growth trends seen throughout 2021. We achieved record premium instrument placements in Q4 with strong gains across our major platforms supporting a 14% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Strong revenue growth enabled delivery of $1.89 and EPS up 12% on a comparable basis as we advanced planned investments in our commercial and innovation capability. Closer benefits from high organic revenue growth in 2021 drove outstanding full year financial performance above our long term goals. IDEXX achieved 16% overall organic revenue growth for the full year, driven by 18% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 29%, an increase of 220 basis points on a comparable basis. And we delivered full year EPS of $8.60 per share up 29% on a comparable basis. We're well-positioned to build on the strong financial performance in 2022. We're targeting revenue gains at the higher end of our long term goals reflected in our outlook for 10% to 12% overall organic revenue growth and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. We're also targeting a 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, building on the strong profit gains through the pandemic as we continue to invest towards the long term development of companion animal healthcare globally. Our EPS outlook of $9.27 to $9.59 per share, reflects 12% to 16%, comparable EPS growth, including an estimated $0.15 per share, or 2% EPS growth impact related to higher projected international tax rates. We'll discuss our 2022 financial outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 10.5% was driven by 13% overall CAG gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, reflecting comparisons to high prior year results that benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $5 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing revenues. Strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflected 13% organic gains across U.S. and international regions, compared to 21% organic growth levels in the fourth quarter of 2020. Strong Q4 CAG results were also supported by 21% gains in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from a recent ezyVet acquisition. For the full year 2021 overall CAG revenues increased 19% organically driven by 18% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting high gains across our major modalities and regions. Strong U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter was aided by solid year-on-year gains in clinical visits and continued positive demand trends which are supporting high levels of clinical revenue growth at the practice level. Same-store U.S. clinical visit growth was 2.2% in Q4, compared to high prior year growth levels. On a two year basis U.S. same-store clinical visits increased at 5.5% with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. An increased focus on healthcare services including diagnostics supported an 8% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4 and nearly 10% gains in clinical diagnostic revenues which increased 14% on an average two year basis. Expanding demand for clinical services and benefits from IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement supported a 1050 basis point premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to U.S. clinical visit growth in the quarter. In terms of practice level trends, we did see some modest impact from the recent Omicron wave on clinical testing volumes in international regions in Q4 which has continued in early 2022. We've also seen some moderation in clinic visit growth in January in the U.S. including near term impacts from higher COVID cases on practice level staffing. We're monitoring these dynamics which we don't see as indicative of changes in strong underlying demand trends. Globally, IDEXX achieved strong organic gains across our major testing modalities in Q4 resulting in exceptional full year growth results. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 12% organically in Q4 reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and high single digit organic growth in international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Referenced lab gains continue to be driven by solid same-store volume growth including benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements. For the full year 2021 global lab revenues increased 70% organically reflecting consistent high gains across U.S. and international regions. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 15% on an organic basis in Q4 reflecting double digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Strong consumable growth reflects increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. These dynamics supported 20% full year organic growth at IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2021. IDEXX had another quarter of outstanding instrument placements building on this momentum. We achieved 5,258 premium instrument placements in Q4 up 29% from prior year levels, reflecting robust gains across U.S. and international regions. We achieved strong global placement growth across our major platforms year-on-year with catalyst up 8%, SediVue up 20% and premium hematology up 72% supported by the continued global rollout of ProCyte One. The breadth and quality of CAG instrument placements supported strong gains in our economic value metric. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels drove a 14% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2021 setting a foundation for continued strong consumable growth as we move forward. Rapid assay revenue increased 10% organically in Q4 reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S. aligned with broader increases in demand for diagnostic testing and high growth in international regions. For the full year 2021 Rapid Assay organic revenue growth was 17% supported by high volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven augmented by moderate net price improvement of approximately 3% in key regions like the U.S. Looking ahead to 2022 we're planning for net price improvement in the range of 3% to 4% reflecting higher list price increases to reflect higher service costs, and continued investment in service quality and product innovation. In other areas of our CAG business our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 30% as reported in Q4 including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Continued strong gains and recurring software and diagnostic imaging services and high comparable growth in PIMS placements were moderated to a degree by tough compares related to strong prior year diagnostic imaging placements. For the full year 2021 veterinary, software and diagnostic imaging revenues expanded to over $200 million up 15% organically and 27% as reported as we continue to advance integration of information technology and insight as a key feature of our diagnostic solutions. Turning to other business segments, water revenues increased 13% organically in Q4 compared to flat organic growth in last year's fourth quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. For the full year 2021 water revenues increased 12% organically compared to a 2% organic decline in 2020. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 90% organically in Q4 compared to 13% organic growth levels in Q4 of 2020. As expected dynamics in our China LPD business including the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing, offset growth and other global regions. For the full year 2021 LPD revenues declined 9% organically compared to 11% gains in 2020. We're planning for continued challenging year-on-year compares and LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 which is factored into our overall revenue outlook. Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth drove solid operating profit gains compared to strong prior levels as we advanced plan investments aligned with our growth strategy. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis in Q4 driven by continued solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth at a modest overall increase in gross margins. We benefited from continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, moderate net price improvement, and higher veterinary software margins, including positive impacts from or expanding SaaS customer base. These factors were moderated by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth, and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. Operating expenses increased 15% on a reported and comparable basis in Q4. As planned, we saw relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we advanced investments in R&D, enhanced our global CAG sales and marketing capability and integrated the ezyVet acquisition. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth in 2022 aligned with our strong global growth momentum. Operating expense investments drove a 70 basis point contraction in comparable operating margins in Q4. For the full year 2021 our operating margins reached 29% up 220 basis points on a comparable basis for the year and up approximately 560 basis points on a comparable basis from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We're targeting to build on the strong performance in 2022 as we invest towards the high return, long term growth potential in our business. Q4 EPS was $1.89 per share, including $0.08 per share a tax benefit related to share based compensation activity. For the full year 2021 EPS was $8.60 up 29% on a comparable basis. Full year EPS results included $32 million or $0.38 per share in tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, which provided 360 basis points of effective tax rate benefits. Foreign exchange effects reduced revenue growth by approximately 1% in Q4 resulting in a $0.02 per share profit impact net of a hedged loss of approximately $500,000. For the full year 2021 foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.16 per share net of foreign exchange hedge losses of $7 million. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar we're planning for 1.5% FX revenue growth headwind in 2022 with approximately 2% to 2.5% year-on-year growth headwinds in the first half. Well, previously established hedge positions will mitigate these impacts on profits, our initial 2022 outlook incorporates an estimated $0.08 net unfavorable EPS impact from the FX at the rates noted in our press release. Free cash flow was $636 million for 2021 or approximately 85% of net income reflecting a $120 million in capital spending including $18 million in real estate purchases. We maintained a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $144 million in cash at the end of the year. In Q4 we established a new five year $1 billion revolving credit facility which provides relatively improved borrowing rates. Our 2022 interest expense outlook incorporate these benefits, current forward interest rates and expectations for a net leverage ratio of one times next year. In Q4, we allocated $245 million to repurchase 391,000 shares in the quarter. We plan to continue to allocate capital to share repurchases as part of our financial approach which is reflected in a projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in our diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2022. Turning towards 2022 outlook we are providing initial guidance for reported revenues of 3.5 billion to 3.565 billion. This outlook reflects a targeted organic revenue growth range of 10% to 12%, carryover benefits of approximately 0.5% from 2021 acquisitions and an estimated 1.5% revenue growth headwind from FX. Our organic growth outlook reflects an estimated growth range of 12% to 14% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. The higher end of this range aligns with sustaining the strong year-on-year growth trends we achieved exiting 2021 and incorporates additional targeted benefits for a moderately higher net price realization and investments in global CAG sector development. Our overall organic growth outlook also factors in continued benefits from expansion of our premium instrument installed base and solid growth in our water business. These positive factors are partially offset by expectations for continued year-on-year pressure on LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 and a projected contraction in human PCR testing revenues reflecting our overall strategic growth focus on our core businesses. Our reported operating margin outlook for full year 2022 is 29.7% to 30.2% reflecting a targeted 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement building on our strong operating margin gains in recent years. We expect operating margin improvement will be supported by solid gross margin gains as we advanced investments in our global commercial and innovation capability and ensure high levels of operational business continuity as a priority. We've incorporated anticipated inflationary cost impacts, as well as benefits from relatively higher net price gains in our overall operating margin outlook. Given exit rates in our OpEx spending and year-on-year operating profit comparison dynamics, we're planning for operating margin improvements to be primarily driven by gains in the second half of 2022. Our preliminary EPS outlook for 2022 is $9.27 to $9.59 per share an increase of 8% to 11% as reported. Our EPS outlook factors in effect -- it increase in our overall effective tax rate from 17.5% to an estimated 21.5% to 22% in 2022. Approximately 100 to 150 basis points of this increase relates to projected impacts from international tax changes. We're also projecting lower tax benefits from share based tax compensation activity. Our EPS outlook reflects projected 2022 stock based compensation tax benefits of $10 million or approximately $0.12 per share compared to high realized 2021 tax benefits of $32 million or $0.38 per share. As noted, we've also incorporated an estimated year on year negative impact of $0.8 per share from FX, net of establish hedge positions. Adjusting for these factors our outlook is for EPS growth of 12% to 16% on a comparable basis, including an estimated $0.15 per share approximately 2% EPS growth impact from international tax rate changes. Our 2022 free cash flow outlook was for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 75% to 80%. This reflects estimated capital spending of 180 million or approximately 5% of revenues, including $50 million related to a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion aligned to support our high growth. Adjusting for this major project, our normalized net income to free cash flow conversion ratio is aligned with our longer term 80% to 90% targets. That concludes our financial view. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. And to your question Chris our 12% to 14% organic growth outlook for CAG Dx recurring revenues assumes positive clinic visit growth in addition to strong performance, ongoing performance by our teams and helping to grow our revenues faster than that. I'll let Jay talk to the color of the momentum that we have on instrument placements in our priorities. In terms of our outlook we didn't break it out, specifically what we're targeting continued strong placement growth. The revenue growth may lag the placement growth somewhat as we see the expansion of programs like IDEXX 360 and have some mix effects from higher growth in international markets, but we're targeting solid instrument year-on-year growth and that's factored into the overall guidance. So we are seeing some impacts selectively in our business. I think you highlighted some of the key drivers, but freight and distribution costs have been a factor. We are monitoring higher labor input costs. I think that's something that we anticipate will be something we'll need to manage effectively. And we have selective impacts in different parts of our business, but we do use electronic components and things of that nature. I think a lot of our focus, Erin is on making sure we have continued very high business continuity, reliability. So we're really pleased with that. We're at 99% and customer reliability and that's our primary focus. And so we do have some impacts and as you pointed out we have a relatively higher expectation for net margins improvement that helps to mitigate that and is reflective to a degree of that and enables us to support the solid operating margin improvements that we're targeting next year. Yes, Mike. So I think the way to think about this as the as we were coming out of 2021 and clearly, we had a big step up in demand through the pandemic that we're confident that we can build off of that. So I think that's one key theme. And as you look at the calibrate this, the exit rate of our business in Q4 we had 13%, CAG DX recurring growth off that higher base. So we were entering the year with that kind of trajectory. And we see some positive drivers here. We're investing in international growth and feel good about the attraction and the potential there and we will have some incremental benefit from net pricing that we highlighted. And so the higher end of the range really reflects kind of building off of the momentum that we had I think to build on kind of Erin's question earlier, one of the metrics we share in our snapshot is just the average revenue per clinical visit in the inventor clinics in the U.S. and that increases Jay noted nearly 200 basis points from pre-pandemic levels from 4% to about 6%. So there's some underlying positive service trends here. And I think what you're seeing in our outlook is confidence that we can execute well, continue to execute well invest in ways that support that and if we can sustain that type of momentum we were, we think we can achieve those higher growth levels. And I think the lower end of the range really is more calibration going back towards more pre-pandemic type growth. It's not where we're necessarily projecting, but I think that that's a potential scenario as well. But all of this is building off of the higher demand. So it's some of this will come down to our execution. And I think things like Omicron or near term dynamics that we'll just need to manage through. As Jay mentioned, we don't see that as indicative of a longer term or an underlying demand issue. But the momentum on our business we feel very positive about and we're investing towards that. I think we've got a good strategy to keep building on that progress. Look, the way I think we're thinking about this is we're building off this higher base. So we clearly had a period there where we needed to look at some two year metrics here to calibrate for 2020 effectively the pandemic dynamics. And now we're moving into sort of that phase of building off the higher base, I would say that there was some incremental benefit last year in Q4 from just the puppy boom and that I think is probably the key factor that sustains in the near term but for the most part we're normalizing off that hire base. And so I think that 12% to 14%, is that full year number one. We're not projecting by quarter, but I think we're that reflective of the overall momentum in the business. I think the Omicron dynamic is a near term dynamic in the U.S. that we didn't really see significantly in Q4. And then we're seeing some effects early here, what we'll sort that out as we go through the quarter, but I think the underlying momentum and trends we're targeting to remain strong and we'll work through these near term dynamics as they play out. So I think the way to think about Nathan is we had a Q4 growth rate year-on-year about 15% and we're working, still working through some compares to some relatively more controlled growth at OpEx levels in the comparable prior year. And so entering into Q1 we expect kind of the that same dynamic will have a relatively higher rate of OpEx that'll be our most challenging compare. And, in general terms, I think, for the full year, you should expect us to be trending back more in line with kind of our overall revenue growth where we want to lean in and invest towards future growth. I think our market dynamics will, as they've been in the past be supported by solid gross margin improvement. And so I think longer term consistent with our longer term outlooks that we've shared at Investor Day, I think OpEx grow closer to revenue growth is a reasonable expectation. Yes. It's more driven by compares than necessarily a change in seasonality, but I did mention that our margin improvement would be in the second half. And as we just discussed, I think are more challenging compare will be in Q1 in terms of the quarters this year, but that's again more reflective of year-on-year dynamic. The one thing to highlight specifically is we'll still be working through an LPD. We have the decline in the African swine fever revenues that really started in the third quarter of 2021. We'll still be working through those compares. So that'll have a dynamic as well. Yes, I mean, it's been pretty constant in terms of panel mix. It's something we don't break out. These are largely configured panels for wellness. So when customers use that get a lot of variation quarter-to-quarter. And so with that, I'd like to thank everybody for joining this morning's call. I know we have some employees who are listening. I would like to say thank you to them for their excellent performance and continued passion for our purpose. Day in and day out, our team delivered excellent results aligned to our long term opportunity while also demonstrating unwavering commitment to our purpose in navigating and evolving landscape through the continued pandemic impacts. Very grateful for the IDEXX team, and the purpose which drives our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian. And good morning. IDEXX sustained a strong performance in Q4 capping an exceptional year for the company. For the full year we delivered 16% organic revenue growth, 29% comparable EPS growth supported by solid operating margin games and 59% ROI fee. These results reflect the attractiveness of our businesses including our core CAG business which is sustaining very strong growth trends benefiting from our commercial expansion in an expanding innovation portfolio. We're well-positioned to build on this momentum in 2022 as reflected in our financial outlook. This morning I'll recap our recent performance and highlight key areas of business focus moving forward including advancement of new innovations in the ongoing expansion of our global commercial capabilities. Both of these are strategic elements of our plan to develop the substantial long term market opportunity still before us. Let me begin with a brief update on sector trends. Overall global companion animal healthcare trends remain strong driven by ongoing robust demand at veterinary clinics for healthcare services, including diagnostics. As Brian highlighted U.S. same-store clinical revenues increased 8% in Q4 supported by 2% growth in same-store clinical visits compared to very strong prior year growth levels. Diagnostic same-store growth continues to expand at a higher pace of nearly 10%. IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth is leading this expansion reflected in 13% organic gains in Q4 building on 21% gains in Q4 of 2020 as we provide highly desired diagnostics and information management platforms that support our customers care mission. We're seeing sustained strong demand transfer clinic, clinical service globally, building on the step up achieved through the pandemic. As highlighted and data shared in our earning snapshot this includes sustained approximately 2% acceleration in U.S. diagnostics revenue per clinical visit in 2021 building on higher 2020 gains. The solid momentum gives us confidence in investing towards accelerated global CAG sector development and is reflected in our outlook of 12% to 14% global CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in 2022 at the high end of our long term goals. Like many sectors of the global economy veterinary clinics continue to work through the challenging dynamic of increased clinical demand in the face of staffing challenges including near term management impacts from the surge of the Omicron variant. It's clear that strong clinical service demand will be a priority for clinics moving forward. IDEXX remains committed and extremely well-positioned to support the growth of our customers through our focus on high customer service levels and solutions that enhance clinic productivity. As we look forward, we're expanding our global commercial capability aligned with the strong demand trends. Our investments in Germany, France and South Korea in the first half of 2021 continue to pay off as expanded commercial footprints in each country enabled significant increases in customer contacts and reach to revenue critical elements of our high touch and account management philosophy. We're tracking towards completion in early 2022 of the already communicated second wave of expansions in three additional countries with more to come. These are holistic initiatives that only involve the addition of customer facing professionals across multiple job types such as account managers, professional service veterinarians, and field service representatives but also include the extension of marketing programs and new field tools such as IDEXX 360 and the addition of more extensive reference of [core] roots and expanded service levels. Increasing our international commercial footprint while maturing our approach will continue to be a key priority beyond wave two countries currently nearing completion. To that end, I'm pleased to share that we are also augmenting our commercial leadership team with an experienced commercial executive in Asia-Pacific CAG, who will join that excess quarter. As we expand, our commercial team continues to deliver the day reflected in over 5000 premium instrument placements in Q4 by far our largest quarterly placements ever achieved. Premium instrument placement growth of 29% includes comparable growth across U.S. and international regions, and resulted in 14% growth in our global premium install base with strong performance across each of our instrument platforms. These exceptional results were delivered despite excess challenges. They demonstrate strong commercial execution as well as the fact that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX innovations to support increased clinical demand today, while investing for future business needs. ProCyte One is a great example of this. Our ProCyte One launch has done exceptionally well. ProCyte One's performance and reliability is used for the demanding environment of a practice has met or exceeded all goals and feedback remains highly positive as customers love it's easy to use and how it fits into the veterinary clinic workflow. We see mid 90% global attach rates with chemistry analyzers in this trend demonstrate ProCyte One's importance in building a full diagnostic workup. Furthermore, the ProCyte One launch benefits from programs like IDEXX 360, which not only provides veterinarians with a flexible, customer friendly way to add this innovative analyzer to their clinics, but also benefits growth across IDEXX testing modalities. Our global ProCyte One regional [route] is now nearly complete and we have delivered over 2500 instruments globally since launching in late Q1 of 2021. A growing installed base of premium instruments supports a robust range of future consumable usage, which gives us confidence and guided ranges for CAG recurring revenue growth. In addition to driving placements and adoption. Our commercial team continues to educate our customers on the benefits of preventive medicine. The preventive care initiative remains our primary vehicle for driving a preventive agenda in the clinic, and provide sales professionals an opportunity to engage in thorough conversations with broad participation from practice staff. Despite restricted access to clinics, we drove approximately 125 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter while also developing plans to simplify the enrollment process for busy customers. And we look forward to deploying this and continuing to support this broader preventive care effort in 2022. We also see continued momentum in software expansion as our innovative products helping customers improve clinic efficiency and pet owner communication. The onboarding of ezyVet has gone very smoothly and subscriptions are tracking favorably to our high expectations. Customers appreciate the advanced capabilities and intuitive workflow ezyVet provides. 81% of PIMS placements were cloud based in the quarter, demonstrating that we are well-positioned to support customers in their shift to the cloud. This trend provides a significant growth opportunity and excellent profit flow. It puts robust and easy to use information management products at the hands of our customers that enable them to focus on providing the highest levels of patient care enabled by diagnostics to improve health outcomes. Our software portfolio is a strategic area of investment and focus for IDEXX. Veterinarians have never been busier and have a deep need and appreciation for software solutions that are easy to use and built on contemporary technology stacks. They look to these solutions to support patient care, staff productivity and internal as well as pet owner communications. Our strategy is to bring enterprise PIM software solutions to our customers that work seamlessly with a broader set of business and clinical applications. Our own or third parties that veterinarians used to run their practices VetConnect PLUS diagnostics results clinical decision support and ordering portal is a great example of this. VetConnect PLUS was launched almost 10 years ago. It's integrated from a workflow standpoint in IDEXX in third party PIMs it is now being used in over 30,000 practices globally. Customers who use our software and diagnostic solutions together correlate with higher growth profiles supporting workflow optimization for our diagnostics testing platforms. Our diagnostic imaging business which includes our industry leading Web PAC software solution also experienced an excellent quarter, demonstrating the preference customers have for our premier low dose imaging solutions. Solid placements in the quarter supported full year placement growth of 35% and double digit year-over-year gains in recurring revenue. We also had strong growth in Web PAC subscriptions for Q4 up 18% versus the prior year and with continued customer retention rates and high 90% range growth in the installed base a profitable revenue stream and increased utilization of services have helped IDEXX webpacks become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. In addition to ensuring the successful rollout and adoption of these recent innovations, we were thrilled to launch a series of new product and service enhancements in BMX last month. Each of these innovations highlight IDEXX's commitment to continually invest in our service and product offerings with a particular focus on providing insights and decision making aids to help customers deliver a higher standard of patient care. These enhancements include an expanded oncology testing platform with additional tests that aid for veterinarians to better identify, stage, treat and monitor several prevalent cancer types and updated 4Dx plus tests with improved parameter performance for Anaplasma and the addition of clinical decision support 4Dx plus and neuro network 6.0 for SediVue which has now been trained on 800 million urine sediment images. Improving the performance of our products is central to our strategy and we're also supporting greater efficiency which helps drive higher adoption and customer satisfaction. Some examples; the new catalyst SDMA brings reagents onboard the test, reducing the number of steps to run the test and time to results while also reducing storage space and waste due to the removal of separate reagent comps. The improved VetConnect PLUS mobile app provides an enhanced user experience, improve the mobile capability and easier pet owner communication and finally coming later in 2022 our 4Dx plus test will allow for extended room temperature storage. The addition of these time saving technologies demonstrates our technology for life approach to product and services designs. Notably, the improved 4Dx Plus product represents our fifth update to the [indiscernible] product first launched in 1992. While this test already represents the gold standard for vector borne disease rapid testing, we remain focused on continuous improvement to support our customers in delivering improved pet health outcomes. Underpinning our strong business performance, it's a prioritized focus on providing continued high level service to our customers. A key element in achieving these service levels is consistent strong execution across our supply chain which we saw again in Q4 through high product availability and strong order turnaround times. In order to build this capability and support growth in the future, we plan to invest in 2022 in the expansion of our manufacturing footprint in lab capacity, while also maintaining strong frontline measures to support high service levels. And while we anticipate some inflationary dynamics in supply chain headwinds going forward, we've captured these impacts in our outlook, and believe we are well positioned to build upon our year end margins. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum and execution in our business and excited about our plans to build on our progress in 2022. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to say thanks to our employees for another top notch year end in pursuit of our purpose and service to our customers. The IDEXX organization remained highly focused on our customers' needs and continued to perform at a very high level during another dynamic and demanding year. The team's perseverance is seen both in the results highlighted this morning, as well as our high levels of engagement as a team. And I'm proud to be able to share today's excellent results on behalf of the whole team's hard work. That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Good morning, Chris. We haven't quantified it. We did see some impact on testing volumes in the international regions from Omicron, in late Q4. It primarily manifested itself in the modest drop off in some lab volumes. And this trend appears to be continuing just in early \u201822 January as it affects the U.S. clinical visit growth. The thing to keep in mind is the underlying customer demand is very strong. What vet practices tell us is that they're busy as they ever been in terms of forward booking. We're seeing month, two month forward booking of patients and [impediments] (ph) just trying to get into practices. So we think practices have a playbook in which to deal with this. We've all seen this movie a couple times at this point. They've done the curbside drop off and pickup. In some cases there's obviously some staffing issues that they're dealing with, we think that that's more of a temporary basis. And we're in a really good position also to be able to support them with our field service, organization and technology solutions that help them be more productive and manage that business. We saw record placements in Q4 of 2021 over 5,000 on the back of record hematology placements in catalyst and SediVue, pretty much across the board. And we think that that momentum will remain intact. Practices are clearly investing in technology to help them from a capacity standpoint. They are looking to us and our solutions that not just support the best standard of care but also support workflow and staff productivity and enable them to handle higher patient volumes. Yes, I'll take that. Good morning, Erin. There is a couple of quick longer term trends that the pandemic probably accelerated that were in effect and if anything, as a result of new pet adoptions and the pivot within practices, the more service versus retail type product sales, I think have just accelerated as a result of the pandemic. Clearly as veterinarians focus on medical services and patient care diagnostics is a big piece of that I think they recognize that diagnostics is obviously a very high margin, very high profit center within their practices. And so I think the combination of more patients, pet owners wanting a higher standards of patient care, veterinarians pivoting to services and the role that diagnostic plays, have been important factors. And then you layer on top of that, our strategy as a company which both includes continuing to innovate both in terms of testing platforms and information management and our commercial strategy, which is a high touch model and being able to work with veterinarians to help them use these tools effectively both business and medical wise, I think we continue to see very strong trends that are higher than pre-pandemic. Sure. Good morning, Mike. Pet cancer is the most prevalent cause of death in dogs. So there are about 6 billion positive cases of cancer of dogs just in the U.S., it's very significant. And if you take a look, that I just did a high level in terms of the process by which the veterinarian diagnosis and treats, it's very complex. It's fragmented and there aren't a complete set of diagnostic tools to help support that. So we think that there is a longer term very attractive market opportunity to be able to help veterinarians navigate cancer diagnosis and treatment. So we're building off our expertise in cancer pathology, which is really more today geared towards cancer identification and then really trying to get across the continuum of care which is the identification and staging and treating in monitoring and bring solutions to that full value chain of care. So the partnerships we announced, we think bring best in class technology to support that process. We're excited by it. It's still early stages in terms of market development. So I think it's less about the revenue opportunity near term and more about supporting veterinarians and helping them navigate what's very complex and what is increasingly pet owner driven demand for these types of services. I think over time it's a quite attractive opportunity. We bring, I think credible technical expertise to be able to support the veterinarian through this and we're excited by what we've learned and continuing to build off those capabilities over time. Yes. John, in terms of the wellness visits, and a couple of things that are potentially driving that. Obviously there's a lot of puppies and kittens who have now become dogs and cats. And I think there's a lot of pet owners who want to get their pets into the practice and being checked up and there's been an emphasis on wellness visits in the U.S. now for quite some time. So it's not new. Obviously there are some capacity constraints in some of these visits get pushed off a month or six weeks. And I think over time, that'll get relieved, but I think the under what we see as the underlying demand for wellness and checkups, is there and have been very robust as you pointed out, and we expect that to be able to sustain. Certainly we and others in the market place, I really focused and emphasizing preventive care, as they an important part of patient health. Good morning. Yes the ezyVet integration has gone quite well, where we're far along in terms of really integrating our sales approach and organizations and product roadmaps. And that continues to received extremely well in the marketplace and the things from the growth numbers that there's a lot of traction behind that. It's a key part of our strategy and over 80% of our PIMs placements were cloud based placements this quarter. So really good traction far long in integration and going well."

I would now like to turn it over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian Mc Keon: Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior-year growth levels. Third quarter results reflect 11.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues sustained at 16%, reflecting mid-to-high teens, 2-year average gains across our major modalities. We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior-year levels, supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains, and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. Walk through the details of our updated full-year outlook later in my comments, let's begin with a review of our third quarter results in recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior-year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million a year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels and working 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent easy bet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. Continued strong U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains and U.S. clinical visits. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3 with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2-year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinical revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. IDEXX, innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive healthcare demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX reference lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3 with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth for strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued high growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units, or 36% from constrained prior levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw a strong global placement gains across our platforms with catalyst up 22%, premium hematology up 62%, and SediVue up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year, and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%. We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements, and continued very high customer retention levels, supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high-growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. Rapid assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior-year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S., and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business or veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high-growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform, with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding Cloud-based capability. Turning to other business segments, water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter, as this business continues to track back towards pre - COVID, growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions. As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior-year demand for African Swine Fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand reflecting relaxation of local African Swine sweep -- Swine Fever disease management approaches in China, and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall on upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. Turning to the P&L, sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from the lapping of $27.5 million G&A charge, related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior-year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls. Gross profit increased 12% in Q3 reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue growth, and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab businesses to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported, and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3. As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global and commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trolling -- trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full-year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our Balance Sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook we're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3,185 million to $3,200 million. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1%, and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full-year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements were offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full-year growth benefit from the FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29% reflecting expectations for 200 basis points to 225 basis points of full-year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior-year levels, driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending, aligned with our high-growth profile. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint, to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full-year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full-year EPS benefits, $0.01 lower than our earlier estimates net of established heads positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high-growth and manage any inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian. Good morning. We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, compared to very strong prior-year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021 with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre -pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX as advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high-growth of customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high-end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. Today, I highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high-growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive companion animal healthcare trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. critical visit growth was 2% in Q3, compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand. To normalized for prior-year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring two-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3. Continuing above the pre -pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points to continued adoption of our preventive approach to pet healthcare. The sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet on our bond. The benefit of stepped up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID19 pandemic through early 2021, and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic on medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owners desire for excellent care, have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced the healthy 7% versus the prior year, and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support the elevated levels of demand, while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX 's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16%, 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1200 basis points above 2-year average critical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance and our team continues to support our customers at a high level. This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the Company. High-growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte, and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX 's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements, had new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument place mode momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resorts. In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are into high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities through rolling country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us. We've completed our expansions in Germany, France, and South Korea, and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries as noted on our last call with hiring, on-boarding, and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second-wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year. In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities, in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European Reference Lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services. Complementing our world-class Reference Lab facility in corn west time Germany. These advancements support high-growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer - centric programs such as IDEXX 360 to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. Innovative products like ProCyte One are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive, as a rave about ProCyte One's easy-to-use, low maintenance profile, and excellent performance. Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption in its new platform globally, and the broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly a 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. Our Rapid Assay business is another area which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior-year. In 14% on a two-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component of the rapid assay business and the wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy, and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally in recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business. Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to play out with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products. This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality, and life-cycle cost advantages. And within diagnostic imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices, and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIM systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. Product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient, are an impactful example of how our technology for life approach in supporting busy practices. Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continue to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers continue driving wellness testing, and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects the resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, year shoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors in their proactive approach, managing front-line operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention. We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high-growth and service levels in our business going forward, where there may be relatively higher-cost in certain areas to support our growth plans. We're confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high-growth aligned with our long-term growth potential. As current momentum positions us well to support investments in infrastructure, solutions, and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us, while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. And extremely proud of what we've accomplished together. And look forward to continued excellence in the future. That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks for taking the question guys. Had a lot of comments in the prepared remarks on strong instrument placement trends, particularly with ProCyte One, from the cross zone, you've been able to see there. Just wondering, are you able to see sequential acceleration there and any increased uptake of set of use, you could clarify on that, and just -- especially in some of those markets, you're seeing incremental competitive introductions by some of your peers. I'm just wondering if you could talk on dynamics and what you can go see from others in the marketplace.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Mike. The Q3 was a record placement really across our premium instruments, hematology, chemistry SediVue. And we think in part what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practice. That's because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity. and, obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you recalled we launched in the U.S. in late Q1, and then internationally in late Q2. And we've see n very rapid uptake that the majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or to existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser. I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind it's also part of our pay-per-run and auto replenishment model. So it's a -- we're excited about the opportunity, if you recall from Investor Day we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally. 2/3 plus of that internationally, we're just in the early days of getting started on that. So very promising outlook for hematology with respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue, obviously into replacements where we're high 30% plus. It's all nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks. If I could ask a follow-up just on trends you saw over the course of 3Q and as we just think about 4Q. If we look at the snapshot in clinical visit growth and on revenues per visit, obviously you have the much tougher comps from a year prior, but as you continue going forward and so 4Q and 1Q next year, as we look at the 2-year stack comp on recurring CAG Diagnostics and total CAG revenue growth, are there any other dynamics we should be mindful of as we think of going into 4Q besides the comp dynamics? Anything else you're seeing in terms of changes in the marketplace or the gross volume growth things like that?\nBrian Mc Keon: Morning, Mike. I think the bigger theme that we're highlighting is the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth trend on a 2-year basis really held up quite well. In the third quarter as we -- as you know, you get into these year-on-year comparison dynamics that we're focusing a bit on the 2-year trend to calibrate. And that we saw the 16% 2-year average annual growth level both in U.S. and international. And I think that's also the premium on a 2-year basis held up very well. It was 1,200 basis points in Q3. So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook. And that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels. So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets. Although the pet population has expanded and sustained and perhaps it might be reflective of victims clinics just being quite easy, but I think it was quite overall modest and our own trends have held up quite well.\nJay Mazelsky: Just to build on that, Mike. All indications there that demand in the marketplace and the trends remain very strong in a -- clearly, the 1 year growth rate held up quite well. If you think back to Q3 in 2020, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was increased pet patient visits. So really nice growth across tough compares the 2-year clinical visit trends as we've talked about it, 4.4% is clearly above pre -pandemic levels at 2% to 3%. And then if you take a look at how we've translated that in our own business, 60% in a globally CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue, U.S. and internationally. Those are 2-year figures. We've seen nice growth across all modalities, whether you look at the 1-year or 2-year. And I think our execution as a Company has been excellent. So the -- I think the growth momentum remains quite strong and as Brian indicated, we're really positioned to support faster growth by expanding capabilities commercially, innovation, really expanding the resiliency and capacity of our supply chain and manufacturing network.\nMichael Ryskin: Great thank you so much.\nJohn Ravis: Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe following up on the last one. Jay or Brian, could you maybe -- how do you feel about vet practice capacity right now? I don't know if you feel like there are any labor shortages that are impacting just overall volumes of vet clinics. But it'd be great to get your perspective on where you think vet practices are operating at this point.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning Nathan. Vet practices are clearly very busy. They -- there are a number of things that they've done, I think on a short-term basis, to be able to provide additional capacity of -- a lot of practices are working longer hours, they're hiring more staff and on a short-term basis, they can hire, let's say associate veterinary technicians and train them. The more trained higher-level skilled staff obviously takes a bit more time. A number of practices have been able to really improve mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do as a Company, there's another -- there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers, tools, software that practices can invest in that help them perform both at a higher medical or clinical level. But also more productively whether its communications or internally or with pet owners, or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is to me, very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast-growth in software PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS.\nNathan Rich: Great. That's helpful. And maybe a follow-up for Brian. What -- how should we think about the right baseline level for operating margins as we head into next year? The cadence this year has been a bit unusual with the elevated margins in the first half of the year. I think the back half. The guidance implies maybe around 26%. And maybe talked about the investments. But could you maybe flush out sort of what you think the right starting point is for as we think about the margin trajectory into 2022? Thank you.\nBrian Mc Keon: Sure. On a full-year basis, I think we said 28.8% to 29%. We do have some quarterly differences in margins normally, I think Q2 tends to be our highest with just some of the wellness testing that goes on Rapid Assay sales and things of that nature. I think we feel good about the growth trajectory in the business, particularly the growth on the CAG recurring revenues that's a key driver for us, and that really gives us the ability to reinvest and into -- to build on the margin performance that we've had. I think we are intending to invest. We have been investing in growth aligned with the higher growth profile and we want to build on that. We see that as a very high return area for us, particularly, areas like commercial investment. We get a very quick payback on that. And we're really pleased with the progress we had in our initial wave of international markets. And we'll look to do more with that next year. We'll provide more clarity on that as we get into the year, but our goal is to build on the strong performance that we have this year. And the strong growth trajectory in the business really gives us an opportunity to do that.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Block, from Stifel.\nJon Block: Great, thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian maybe just to start, the gross margin trend, it was down for the third consecutive quarter. And I know you called out some mix headwinds, ongoing investments, but just want to go back to the big deck from the Analyst Day. You talked about gross margin, I'll frame it as that double up green arrow long term. And so I'm just curious, does that double up green arrow take hold in '22 or should we think about some of these investments really spilling out into the next several quarters?\nBrian Mc Keon: Okay, John. I think it's important to calibrate at just what we're working through, if you go back to last year. And at just looking at our numbers and year-over-year improvement on a comparable basis. We were up over 200 basis points in Q2 - Q3 last year. We're comparing to some higher numbers in terms of the levels we were at last year where we had really constrained cost conditions. And I think the -- that's a key factor we are investing back now and we're seeing that paying off in terms of high service levels and growth. I think we had some impacts from mix through the X1 instrument placement growth has a little bit of a mix headwind for us. And those are factors we're working through. But I think the overall dynamics in margins are something that we believe we can build upon. We'll provide more insight into that as we get into next year. But I think that longer-term trend, the key driver there is our strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth rates. And we are well-positioned to build on that with the trends that we've seen in the business so I think that longer-term story still holds for us.\nJon Block: Okay. And then just a follow-up. Maybe we just push you a little bit on the '22 trends in CAG curing and the 16% CAG recurring 2-year average has been remarkably consistent for the first 3 quarters of '21. The guide implies a slight step down in the fourth quarter of '21. And is that slight deceleration the way to think about the CAG Dx 2-year slope as we head into '22 and to maybe layer on top of that, is there an opportunity for you guys, for price to play a bigger role in CAG Dx into '22, just based on what we hear from some of the practices on their recent ability to realize price? Thanks, guys.\nBrian Mc Keon: We didn't provide specific guidance on Q4, but I can tell you that our high-end of our range is consistent with the trends that we've seen on a 2-year basis on CAG Diagnostic recurring for the first 3 quarters. So that is reflected in a guidance. The overall organic growth, just keep in mind, we're up against a little tougher concurrent instruments in Q4. It's not a change in trend. It's just we're working through some compares there. But it's -- again the high-end is largely consistent with where we've been trending. I think that we're going to learn more on this as we move forward. I think the -- we're really pleased with the execution in the business. I think the momentum on our key initiatives, particularly things like instruments, give us a lot of confidence that we can build on. The strong consumable growth, and I think our execution to other modalities is very strong as well. And we're watching the market trends and I think that it's very encouraging. I think there -- like I said, there may be some moderation in terms of the step-up in things like pet population growth and we've got to pay attention to capacity at clinics and things like that, but those are good problems that we think we can help our customers with. So we're -- I think that's a key theme. Hopefully you here today is the trends of the business we're very pleased with, particularly in CAG business, and we -- we're looking to invest to build on them.\nJon Block: In that price realization Brian, if I can just circle back on that -- sorry do you think that one's a bigger opportunity?\nBrian Mc Keon: Sorry about that, John. So we've been in that 2% to 3% range. I think that -- hey, look, I think that is an area that we were going to continue to look at. Pet owners are willing to pay more for services over time. There may be some select inflationary pressures in the business here and things like some input costs on labor and freight. And so we're paying attention to that. I think it is something we can look at over time if we see some sustained impacts on those fronts. And like I said, I think the market backdrop -- the industry backdrop gives us an opportunity to look at that just given the strength of the pet owner bond.\nJon Block: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Ravis: Our next question is from Chris Scott from JPMorgan.\nChris Scott: Great. Thanks so much. Just this 2 for me. I guess, first on in-person, that access. I think you mentioned in-person access now in the 50% to 60% range. As that number moves higher, is that a meaningful benefit for your business or have you found that you were able to do pretty much everything you need to do given the access as it is today. And I just had 1 follow-up after that.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Chris. We -- we're up around 60% in the U.S, 50% outside of the U.S. And we think that can grow. The net will be higher as we work through the -- hopefully, what's the tail end of the pandemic. I think we've gotten very good at really segmenting what should be done or what is best on, in-person versus virtually. We've been able to -- I think pretty much do all what we need to do virtually. But there are some activities like whether you're introducing a product or visiting competitive accounts in building. And I think strengthening relationships are better done in person. So we think that over time that we'll get a increase. It's not going to go back to 100%, but it'll be something less than that. I think it will benefit our preventive care initiative, where we know practices are not only very busy, but I think repeated access is helpful in being able to sell and partner with customers. With that program, do we expect over time that right step-up to pre -pandemic levels.\nChris Scott: Okay, great. And then just come back to the top of inflation. Just what do you think about this kind of new inflationary environment? Are you seeing or do you expect to see in the near-term any gross or operating margin pressures to this? I think you mentioned that if this is more sustained, there might be an opportunity within -- on the price side to address, but I'm just trying to think in the nearer term, is that something that's noticeable in the numbers or is there abilities to offset that elsewhere in the business?\nBrian Mc Keon: This is, Brian, the -- we have seen some inflationary impacts on the business. I think it's been more in areas like freight and distribution, which I think a lot of companies are experiencing. And for us, it's a relatively select on input costs, things like electronics and in resins, and we're paying attention to labor costs as well. I think those are all important areas for us. We've been able to manage through those effects well and we're really focused on sustaining high levels service for our customers, particularly in this high growth market. So that's our focus and our intent and I think we're confident that we can build on the profit trends that we've had while managing through those kind of effects on our business.\nChris Scott: Great. Thanks so much.\nJohn Ravis: Our next question is from Ryan Daniels, from William Blair.\nMitch: Hey guys, Mitch speaking for Ryan. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to start, given the lack of bandwidth in the [Indiscernible] in the constraint on the capacity, has it affected the selling process and things like product education? Is that affected negatively at all or have you been able to work around that?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Good morning. As I had previously indicated, practices are extremely busy and it has affected how we do our sales calls. Once upon time you could get a fair amount of time with the veterinarian and her staff workers -- her staff and I think we've -- we try to be very efficient. And what -- previously we may have had 40 minutes or 50 minutes, now we're able to accomplish in 20. So we've adjusted accordingly where have provided tools to our sales organization so that they're productive and they can get to the point. And we continue to provide a lot of training including CE Training virtually into the webinar to our customers, so that they can get the training they need when they have some free windows and moments. We try to be, obviously, respectful, but very efficient when we could call it practices. And because I think most practice and practice owners consider as highly relevant to their success. They, at large measure, provide time when we meet with them. And I think with good results.\nMitch: Great thanks. Brian, on the capital instruments side of things, would you say you worked your way through most of the back-fill, and a lot of this growth is now incremental, practices realizing that they need an addition of a ProCyte or an additional Catalyst or that sort of thing?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. I think this is that the capital performance we've seen is not pent-up demand, it really represents Investments. The practices are making in their capacity and really improve capacity and productivity of their practices. So I think it's just a solid reflection of demand trends.\nMitch: Great, thanks.\nJohn Ravis: Our next question from Balaji Prasad from Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Couple of them. Firstly, all that you did comment on increased testing for ASF, I wanted to understand if you have visibility into what has led to this, and see if there's any broader read through to ASF trends. In other words, can an increase in testing signal that ASF in sense of spiking up -- spiking gain? Secondly, I'm not sure about this, but obviously in any supply chain disruptions and reach off your segments would be or could be most exposed to the current global supply chain challenges? And lastly if you can, can you just help us understand the CAG dynamics better? Trying to correlate the same-store revenue growth, which is 5% points above the visit growth of 2%. So is this all linked to higher utilization or was there any component of pricing which is above normal trends? Thank you.\nBrian Mc Keon: Why don't I take your first question on African swine fever. The primary dynamics we've seen around our China business for LPD, we saw a significant step-up in program testing in support of addressing African swine fever to last year and -- but those trends have changed. There are changes in the local management of the disease in China where there is now harvesting of the -- local farmers are allowed to harvest the animals rather than -- so that's leading them to harvest them rather than treat the disease. So there's been a decline in demand and that's raised some compares for us. So for our business, that's been the primary impact on African swine fever. And we're anticipating that's going to be a -- continue to be a challenge for us year-over-year for some upcoming quarters.\nJay Mazelsky: And I'll speak to the supply chain. I think resiliency and performance of the business, which has been excellent. As I previously indicated, we have an excellent long-term supplier relationships. We've been able to leverage those and they make sure that we're very well provided. We also -- most of our manufacturing or almost all of our manufacturing is local where you're assured that we have a great deal of product standardization. We have maintained high inventory buffers. So we've been able to really support very high product availability throughout the pandemic. Our customers have clearly appreciated that, and have rewarded us with their business. So we feel very positive about our ability to continue to do that going forward.\nBrian Mc Keon: I believe your third question was on utilization at the clinic level, and --\nJay Mazelsky: Right.\nBrian Mc Keon: -- what we point out at if that was those correct is the year-over-year basis. Again, you get into these compares with last year, we had a big step-up and wellness testing and pent-up demand. The big -- the bigger driver of growth in the third quarter year-over-year was utilization growth. So the utilization gains at the clinic level have remained quite strong and on a two-year basis, good one-year growth. And it was more than offset on a flat frequency that was more related to the year-on-year compares in terms of the testing of number of visits.\nJay Mazelsky: Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for calling in. I'd also like to address the broader IDEXX team, some of which are on the call and say thank you for their continued extraordinary performance. Our employees have demonstrated an admirable commitment to our purpose and excellent ability to execute against our strategy. And I truly appreciate all their efforts. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Mc Keon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior-year growth levels. Third quarter results reflect 11.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues sustained at 16%, reflecting mid-to-high teens, 2-year average gains across our major modalities. We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior-year levels, supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains, and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. Walk through the details of our updated full-year outlook later in my comments, let's begin with a review of our third quarter results in recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior-year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million a year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels and working 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent easy bet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. Continued strong U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains and U.S. clinical visits. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3 with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2-year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinical revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. IDEXX, innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive healthcare demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX reference lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3 with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth for strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued high growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units, or 36% from constrained prior levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw a strong global placement gains across our platforms with catalyst up 22%, premium hematology up 62%, and SediVue up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year, and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%. We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements, and continued very high customer retention levels, supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high-growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. Rapid assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior-year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S., and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business or veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high-growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform, with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding Cloud-based capability. Turning to other business segments, water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter, as this business continues to track back towards pre - COVID, growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions. As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior-year demand for African Swine Fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand reflecting relaxation of local African Swine sweep -- Swine Fever disease management approaches in China, and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall on upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. Turning to the P&L, sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from the lapping of $27.5 million G&A charge, related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior-year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls. Gross profit increased 12% in Q3 reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue growth, and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab businesses to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported, and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3. As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global and commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trolling -- trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full-year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our Balance Sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook we're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3,185 million to $3,200 million. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1%, and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full-year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements were offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full-year growth benefit from the FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29% reflecting expectations for 200 basis points to 225 basis points of full-year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior-year levels, driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending, aligned with our high-growth profile. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint, to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full-year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full-year EPS benefits, $0.01 lower than our earlier estimates net of established heads positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high-growth and manage any inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Morning, Mike. I think the bigger theme that we're highlighting is the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth trend on a 2-year basis really held up quite well. In the third quarter as we -- as you know, you get into these year-on-year comparison dynamics that we're focusing a bit on the 2-year trend to calibrate. And that we saw the 16% 2-year average annual growth level both in U.S. and international. And I think that's also the premium on a 2-year basis held up very well. It was 1,200 basis points in Q3. So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook. And that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels. So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets. Although the pet population has expanded and sustained and perhaps it might be reflective of victims clinics just being quite easy, but I think it was quite overall modest and our own trends have held up quite well. Sure. On a full-year basis, I think we said 28.8% to 29%. We do have some quarterly differences in margins normally, I think Q2 tends to be our highest with just some of the wellness testing that goes on Rapid Assay sales and things of that nature. I think we feel good about the growth trajectory in the business, particularly the growth on the CAG recurring revenues that's a key driver for us, and that really gives us the ability to reinvest and into -- to build on the margin performance that we've had. I think we are intending to invest. We have been investing in growth aligned with the higher growth profile and we want to build on that. We see that as a very high return area for us, particularly, areas like commercial investment. We get a very quick payback on that. And we're really pleased with the progress we had in our initial wave of international markets. And we'll look to do more with that next year. We'll provide more clarity on that as we get into the year, but our goal is to build on the strong performance that we have this year. And the strong growth trajectory in the business really gives us an opportunity to do that. Okay, John. I think it's important to calibrate at just what we're working through, if you go back to last year. And at just looking at our numbers and year-over-year improvement on a comparable basis. We were up over 200 basis points in Q2 - Q3 last year. We're comparing to some higher numbers in terms of the levels we were at last year where we had really constrained cost conditions. And I think the -- that's a key factor we are investing back now and we're seeing that paying off in terms of high service levels and growth. I think we had some impacts from mix through the X1 instrument placement growth has a little bit of a mix headwind for us. And those are factors we're working through. But I think the overall dynamics in margins are something that we believe we can build upon. We'll provide more insight into that as we get into next year. But I think that longer-term trend, the key driver there is our strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth rates. And we are well-positioned to build on that with the trends that we've seen in the business so I think that longer-term story still holds for us. We didn't provide specific guidance on Q4, but I can tell you that our high-end of our range is consistent with the trends that we've seen on a 2-year basis on CAG Diagnostic recurring for the first 3 quarters. So that is reflected in a guidance. The overall organic growth, just keep in mind, we're up against a little tougher concurrent instruments in Q4. It's not a change in trend. It's just we're working through some compares there. But it's -- again the high-end is largely consistent with where we've been trending. I think that we're going to learn more on this as we move forward. I think the -- we're really pleased with the execution in the business. I think the momentum on our key initiatives, particularly things like instruments, give us a lot of confidence that we can build on. The strong consumable growth, and I think our execution to other modalities is very strong as well. And we're watching the market trends and I think that it's very encouraging. I think there -- like I said, there may be some moderation in terms of the step-up in things like pet population growth and we've got to pay attention to capacity at clinics and things like that, but those are good problems that we think we can help our customers with. So we're -- I think that's a key theme. Hopefully you here today is the trends of the business we're very pleased with, particularly in CAG business, and we -- we're looking to invest to build on them. Sorry about that, John. So we've been in that 2% to 3% range. I think that -- hey, look, I think that is an area that we were going to continue to look at. Pet owners are willing to pay more for services over time. There may be some select inflationary pressures in the business here and things like some input costs on labor and freight. And so we're paying attention to that. I think it is something we can look at over time if we see some sustained impacts on those fronts. And like I said, I think the market backdrop -- the industry backdrop gives us an opportunity to look at that just given the strength of the pet owner bond. This is, Brian, the -- we have seen some inflationary impacts on the business. I think it's been more in areas like freight and distribution, which I think a lot of companies are experiencing. And for us, it's a relatively select on input costs, things like electronics and in resins, and we're paying attention to labor costs as well. I think those are all important areas for us. We've been able to manage through those effects well and we're really focused on sustaining high levels service for our customers, particularly in this high growth market. So that's our focus and our intent and I think we're confident that we can build on the profit trends that we've had while managing through those kind of effects on our business. Why don't I take your first question on African swine fever. The primary dynamics we've seen around our China business for LPD, we saw a significant step-up in program testing in support of addressing African swine fever to last year and -- but those trends have changed. There are changes in the local management of the disease in China where there is now harvesting of the -- local farmers are allowed to harvest the animals rather than -- so that's leading them to harvest them rather than treat the disease. So there's been a decline in demand and that's raised some compares for us. So for our business, that's been the primary impact on African swine fever. And we're anticipating that's going to be a -- continue to be a challenge for us year-over-year for some upcoming quarters. I believe your third question was on utilization at the clinic level, and -- -- what we point out at if that was those correct is the year-over-year basis. Again, you get into these compares with last year, we had a big step-up and wellness testing and pent-up demand. The big -- the bigger driver of growth in the third quarter year-over-year was utilization growth. So the utilization gains at the clinic level have remained quite strong and on a two-year basis, good one-year growth. And it was more than offset on a flat frequency that was more related to the year-on-year compares in terms of the testing of number of visits."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian. Good morning. We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, compared to very strong prior-year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021 with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre -pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX as advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high-growth of customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high-end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. Today, I highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high-growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive companion animal healthcare trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. critical visit growth was 2% in Q3, compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand. To normalized for prior-year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring two-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3. Continuing above the pre -pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points to continued adoption of our preventive approach to pet healthcare. The sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet on our bond. The benefit of stepped up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID19 pandemic through early 2021, and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic on medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owners desire for excellent care, have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced the healthy 7% versus the prior year, and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support the elevated levels of demand, while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX 's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16%, 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1200 basis points above 2-year average critical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance and our team continues to support our customers at a high level. This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the Company. High-growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte, and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX 's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements, had new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument place mode momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resorts. In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are into high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities through rolling country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us. We've completed our expansions in Germany, France, and South Korea, and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries as noted on our last call with hiring, on-boarding, and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second-wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year. In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities, in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European Reference Lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services. Complementing our world-class Reference Lab facility in corn west time Germany. These advancements support high-growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer - centric programs such as IDEXX 360 to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. Innovative products like ProCyte One are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive, as a rave about ProCyte One's easy-to-use, low maintenance profile, and excellent performance. Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption in its new platform globally, and the broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly a 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. Our Rapid Assay business is another area which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior-year. In 14% on a two-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component of the rapid assay business and the wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy, and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally in recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business. Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to play out with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products. This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality, and life-cycle cost advantages. And within diagnostic imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices, and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIM systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. Product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient, are an impactful example of how our technology for life approach in supporting busy practices. Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continue to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers continue driving wellness testing, and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects the resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, year shoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors in their proactive approach, managing front-line operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention. We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high-growth and service levels in our business going forward, where there may be relatively higher-cost in certain areas to support our growth plans. We're confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high-growth aligned with our long-term growth potential. As current momentum positions us well to support investments in infrastructure, solutions, and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us, while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. And extremely proud of what we've accomplished together. And look forward to continued excellence in the future. That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions. Good morning, Mike. The Q3 was a record placement really across our premium instruments, hematology, chemistry SediVue. And we think in part what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practice. That's because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity. and, obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you recalled we launched in the U.S. in late Q1, and then internationally in late Q2. And we've see n very rapid uptake that the majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or to existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser. I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind it's also part of our pay-per-run and auto replenishment model. So it's a -- we're excited about the opportunity, if you recall from Investor Day we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally. 2/3 plus of that internationally, we're just in the early days of getting started on that. So very promising outlook for hematology with respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue, obviously into replacements where we're high 30% plus. It's all nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally. Just to build on that, Mike. All indications there that demand in the marketplace and the trends remain very strong in a -- clearly, the 1 year growth rate held up quite well. If you think back to Q3 in 2020, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was increased pet patient visits. So really nice growth across tough compares the 2-year clinical visit trends as we've talked about it, 4.4% is clearly above pre -pandemic levels at 2% to 3%. And then if you take a look at how we've translated that in our own business, 60% in a globally CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue, U.S. and internationally. Those are 2-year figures. We've seen nice growth across all modalities, whether you look at the 1-year or 2-year. And I think our execution as a Company has been excellent. So the -- I think the growth momentum remains quite strong and as Brian indicated, we're really positioned to support faster growth by expanding capabilities commercially, innovation, really expanding the resiliency and capacity of our supply chain and manufacturing network. Good morning Nathan. Vet practices are clearly very busy. They -- there are a number of things that they've done, I think on a short-term basis, to be able to provide additional capacity of -- a lot of practices are working longer hours, they're hiring more staff and on a short-term basis, they can hire, let's say associate veterinary technicians and train them. The more trained higher-level skilled staff obviously takes a bit more time. A number of practices have been able to really improve mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do as a Company, there's another -- there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers, tools, software that practices can invest in that help them perform both at a higher medical or clinical level. But also more productively whether its communications or internally or with pet owners, or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is to me, very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast-growth in software PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS. Good morning, Chris. We -- we're up around 60% in the U.S, 50% outside of the U.S. And we think that can grow. The net will be higher as we work through the -- hopefully, what's the tail end of the pandemic. I think we've gotten very good at really segmenting what should be done or what is best on, in-person versus virtually. We've been able to -- I think pretty much do all what we need to do virtually. But there are some activities like whether you're introducing a product or visiting competitive accounts in building. And I think strengthening relationships are better done in person. So we think that over time that we'll get a increase. It's not going to go back to 100%, but it'll be something less than that. I think it will benefit our preventive care initiative, where we know practices are not only very busy, but I think repeated access is helpful in being able to sell and partner with customers. With that program, do we expect over time that right step-up to pre -pandemic levels. Yes. Good morning. As I had previously indicated, practices are extremely busy and it has affected how we do our sales calls. Once upon time you could get a fair amount of time with the veterinarian and her staff workers -- her staff and I think we've -- we try to be very efficient. And what -- previously we may have had 40 minutes or 50 minutes, now we're able to accomplish in 20. So we've adjusted accordingly where have provided tools to our sales organization so that they're productive and they can get to the point. And we continue to provide a lot of training including CE Training virtually into the webinar to our customers, so that they can get the training they need when they have some free windows and moments. We try to be, obviously, respectful, but very efficient when we could call it practices. And because I think most practice and practice owners consider as highly relevant to their success. They, at large measure, provide time when we meet with them. And I think with good results. Yeah. I think this is that the capital performance we've seen is not pent-up demand, it really represents Investments. The practices are making in their capacity and really improve capacity and productivity of their practices. So I think it's just a solid reflection of demand trends. And I'll speak to the supply chain. I think resiliency and performance of the business, which has been excellent. As I previously indicated, we have an excellent long-term supplier relationships. We've been able to leverage those and they make sure that we're very well provided. We also -- most of our manufacturing or almost all of our manufacturing is local where you're assured that we have a great deal of product standardization. We have maintained high inventory buffers. So we've been able to really support very high product availability throughout the pandemic. Our customers have clearly appreciated that, and have rewarded us with their business. So we feel very positive about our ability to continue to do that going forward. Right. Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for calling in. I'd also like to address the broader IDEXX team, some of which are on the call and say thank you for their continued extraordinary performance. Our employees have demonstrated an admirable commitment to our purpose and excellent ability to execute against our strategy. And I truly appreciate all their efforts. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business.  Revenue increased 30% as reported and 25% organically supported by 26% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international regions. As we work through comparisons to prior year COVID impacts, we'll be highlighting select two-year average annual revenue growth metrics to calibrate our business trends.  In the second quarter, average annual two-year organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was 16%, in line with the strong two-year growth trends in Q4 and Q1. Operating profit increased 30% on a comparable basis in the second quarter, reflecting benefits from high revenue growth and moderate operating margin gains, as we begin to lap the tight cost controls introduced during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020.  High operating profit gains enabled delivery of $2.34 in earnings per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable basis. Continued strong momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver high revenue and profit gains in 2021.  We're raising our full year revenue growth outlook range by $55 million at midpoint to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. This reflects an outlook for reported revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, including favorable impacts from FX changes and benefits from our recent acquisitions. Our updated full year outlook is for 14.5% to 16% overall organic revenue growth and 16% to 17.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These organic growth ranges are 1% to 1.5% higher than our last outlook, reflecting expectations for sustained strong performance in our CAG business globally.  Our full year financial outlook reflects a targeted 175 to 225 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, up 25 basis points from our last outlook as we advance increase investments in our CAG innovation and commercial capability.  We're increasing our EPS outlook to $8.20 to $8.36 per share, up $0.25 per share at midpoint reflecting 25% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook later in my comments.  Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by 27% CAG revenue gains and 27% growth in our water business, benefitted from the lapping of prior year pandemic impacts. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 26% organically reflecting 24% growth in the U.S. and 30% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in the U.S. and 18% growth in international. Strong CAG results were also supported by 78% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues compared to constrained prior year levels. Q2 growth in U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was aided by high year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical visits, benefiting in part from comparisons to lower visit levels in April and May of 2020. U.S. clinical visit growth was 13% overall in Q2 with strong gains across non-wellness and wellness visit categories. On an average two-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.8% annual rate, down modestly from strong Q1 results.  The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 1,100 basis points in the second quarter, up moderately and on track with our full year outlook.  Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 16% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2. Diagnostic revenue per practice increased 15% on a one-year basis and 12% on an average two-year basis in Q2.  Looking ahead to the second half of 2021, as noted in our last call, we expect to see lower levels of one-year growth in U.S. clinical visits and CAG Diagnostic revenue gains, as we lap the significant step up in demand we saw in the second half of 2020. These dynamics are factored into our revenue guidance which projects sustained strong tier growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in H2.  IDEXX innovation and commercial initiatives continue to build on positive healthcare demand trends driving high Q2 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 25% organically in Q2, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 30% growth in international regions.  Our international reference lab gains continue to benefit from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories.  IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the second quarter, also reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and approximately 30% organic gains in international. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to constrained prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 3,756 units, up over 400 units from strong Q1 results and doubled the placement levels seen last year.  The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 308 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 87% year-on-year and 938 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 75%.  We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements, driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base.  We achieved 1,119 premium hematology placements, including hundreds of ProCyte One installs as we advance our global rollout schedule. This supported 11% growth in our global premium hematology install base compared to Q2 2020.  We also placed 662 SediVue, including strong placement levels in international regions under IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment install base by 24%. We're looking forward to building on this momentum as we gain increased direct access at veterinary clinics globally and support strong demand for diagnostic testing.  Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 28% organic growth rate in Q2, reflecting 20% plus gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated 30% plus growth in international geographies. Of note, core vector borne disease retention rates for U.S. rapid assay reached 97% in the quarter, aligned with sustained high IDEXX retention rates across our major modalities.  High CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 26% organically and 33% as reported, including initial benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition.  We saw high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements, driven by favorable customer response to our entry level ImageVue DR30 platform with approximately 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We also continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability.  In our veterinary software services business, we posted double digit organic revenue gains driven by growth in Cornerstone and Neo placements, and strong growth in recurring services. As Jay will discuss, we expanded our cloud-based software capability to our recently announced acquisition of ezyVet, which closed in June. We estimate ezyVet will contribute approximately 15 million to full year 2021 revenues, which is factored into our updated outlook.  Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues increased 27% organically in Q2 compared to 16% declines in last year\u2019s second quarter driven by early pandemic-related impacts. We continue to see a solid recovery in demand for water testing as economies reopen including recovery in non-compliance related testing volumes that have been more constrained during the pandemic.  Livestock poultry and dairy revenue decreased 2% organically in Q2. Those results were constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand in key areas such as African swine fever testing. Revenue growth was also impacted by relatively lower herd health screening levels reflecting reduced exports, including effects from restrictions on live animal imports into China.  We're planning on reduced LPE revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021, as we continue to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our ASF programs, and manage through expected pressure on our China LPD business from rebuilding swine herds, low pork prices, and changing government requirements related to livestock infectious disease programs. Turning to the P&L, we had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2, driven primarily by benefits from high year-on-year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We're now starting to work through comparisons to control costs levels in the prior year that were implemented as part of our pandemic contingency management efforts. Despite these dynamics, our strong revenue growth supported the solid 110 basis point expansion of our operating margins on a comparable basis, helping to drive an increase in operating profits of 34% as reported and 30% on a comparable basis.  Gross profit increased 29% in Q2, driven by high revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis, reflecting mixed impacts from higher instrument revenue and moderated lab gross margins gains as we lapped tightly controlled prior year cost levels in key areas such as lab operations. Gross margin gains continue to benefit from strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, including positive impacts for moderate price gains. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains over the balance of this year as we continue to lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels and see impacts from increases in reference lab staffing and capacity, aligned was supporting high revenue growth.  Operating expenses in Q2 increased 24% as reported and 20% on a comparable basis. In Q2 of 2020, we advanced approximately 25 million of cost reductions related to planned levels, including temporary reductions in salary and benefits, and also saw significant cost reductions in other areas such as employee healthcare accruals.  The higher operating expense cost growth in Q2 reflects lapping these dynamics as well as the advancement of investments in our global commercial and innovation capability, aligned with our accelerated revenue growth profile. We anticipate operating expense growth will be higher than revenue growth in the second half of 2021, as these investments and the integration of the ezyVet acquisition advance. We also expect to see relative increases in costs such as employee healthcare claims and travel, as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. Q2 EPS was $2.34 per share, including benefits of 6 million or $0.07 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q2 EPS increased 33%. Foreign exchange added 8 million to operating profits and $0.07 to EPS in Q2 net of 3 million in hedge losses.  Free cash flow was 211 million in the quarter and 316 million for the first half of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 95%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments last year. We're increasing our outlook for full year 2021 capital spending to 150 million to 160 million to reflect additional investments to support manufacturing and distribution growth capacity, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. With this higher level of projected spending, we're updating our free cash flow conversion outlook for the full year to approximately 80% of net income.  Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with 232 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated 188 million in capital to repurchase 341,000 shares in the quarter.  Turning to our 2021 full year outlook, we're increasing our projected revenue range for overall revenue to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. At midpoint, this reflects approximately 30 million in organic operational improvement, approximately 10 million benefits from updated FX assumptions and approximately 15 million in increased full year revenue benefit from acquisitions. Our updated revenue outlook is 17% to 18.5% as reported, including approximately 2% for full year growth benefit from FX at approximately 0.5% benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 14.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 16% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. The high end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range reflects two-year average annual growth rates in line with strong H1 performance levels.  As noted on a one-year growth basis, we expect to see moderation in H2 from very high year-on-year growth rate seen in the first half of this year as you work through the comparison to the acceleration in growth that we saw in the second half of 2020, including fulfillment of pent-up demand in last year's third quarter. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half, and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year as we lapped the benefits over prior initiatives and plan for lower human PCR testing levels.  In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.6% to 29.1%, reflecting increased expectations for 175 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement.  Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.17 of positive full year EPS benefit net of establish hedge positions.  Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.25 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.06 per share higher than our prior projections. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release in earnings snapshot.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong results supported by continued favorable trends in our core CAG business and excellent execution by the IDEXX team. As noted, we delivered 25% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by high organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth.  There were strong gains across all CAG business segments and testing modalities, representing a continuation of the accelerated growth trends we've seen since the second half of 2020. Strong sector growth and outstanding execution by the IDEXX team gives us confidence to raise our 2021 financial outlook, as we continue to invest towards our significant long-term growth opportunity.  Today, I'll provide a brief update on the trends we're seeing in key regions in our companion animal sector and discuss the status of our initiatives to strengthen our international commercial capabilities.  I\u2019ll also share an update on our ProCyte One launch and growing software portfolio, including the ezyVet acquisition which will better position us to capitalize on favorable tailwinds, further enhance practice productivity and raise the standard of patient care.  Let me start with an update on sector trends. Global sector trends remained favorable in the second quarter reflected, for example, in sustained high U.S. clinical visit levels that support continued strong increases in veterinary service revenues, including diagnostics. As Brian noted, U.S. clinical visits increased 13% in the quarter and 4.8% on a two-year average annual basis, with continued strong gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This growth was supported by growing pet population and veterinarians focus on medical services, which has sustained even as pandemic restrictions have eased. The solid trends we're seeing across all global regions in Q2, our strong commercial execution is building on this momentum, reflected in IDEXX CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 26% on a one-year basis and 16% on a two-year average annual basis.  Within the clinic, veterinarians and the teams continued to rise to the challenge of increased demand, working hard to keep up with industry growth, while also delivering excellent patient care to ever more engaged pet parents. IDEXX is well positioned to provide them the tools and services necessary to meet these demands, supporting 15% diagnostics revenue growth per practice, and even faster growth for IDEXX revenues. Overall, we feel very positive about the strong sector backdrop, our strategy to bring testing and information management innovation to the practice and our team's level of execution, which is reflected in our raised full year revenue outlook.  In terms of execution, our commercial team continues to deliver exceptional results despite continued constraint clinic access. Instrument placements showed increased momentum in the second quarter, with over 3,750 total premium placements, up solidly from a strong Q1, helping to drive 14% growth in our premium worldwide install base for the quarter.  This included double digit growth in premium chemistry, hematology and urine analysis and cell basis, as well as continued excellent growth in new and competitive accounts. Veterinary customers are extremely busy due to high visit volumes, and they're investing in IDEXX instruments, diagnostics and tools to support practice growth, patient care and staff productivity.  Our digital cytology solution is an excellent example of this point and innovative service that extends the capability and reach of the practice. By providing cytology testing results in the U.S. with a report authored by expert pathologists in under two hours at any time during the day or week, 365 days a year, veterinarians are able to provide a higher standard of care to their patients, improve staff and clinical productivity, and drive appropriate testing and practice revenues. Validating this medical value proposition, we saw strong customer interest in orders for a digital cytology solution Q2. We also continue to advance key programs, like IDEXX preventive care that helped clinics raise the standard of care aligned with higher levels of pet owner engagement. In Q2, we executed 150 new preventive care enrollments as we continue to advance towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In terms of customer access, we continue to operate in a hybrid model, with access to a limited but improving in both the U.S. and international regions. In the U.S., approximately 60% of customer visits were in-person in q2, whereas it was approximately 50% in Europe. This hasn\u2019t impacted our ability to deliver outstanding results as both new innovations and our excellent relationships we have with customers have driven significant growth across all regions.  The deep customer relationships with our sales professionals have only been reinforced and strengthened by the best-in-class support we provided to customers throughout the pandemic. Of note, we're particularly pleased with our high levels of execution in regions like Europe, where we are expanding the successful go-to-market approaches we've applied in the U.S.  This was reflected in 400 catalysts placements in new and competitive accounts outside of North America, with half of these placements under IDEXX 360 agreements. The expansion to the IDEXX 360 program is also supporting sustained strong gains and lab revenues in Europe, accelerating new account acquisition and helping to inspire faster customer growth at IDEXX 360 customers.  A key focus of our strategy in this context is on developing the long-term international revenue opportunity through an expansion of our direct commercial presence. We've completed the commercial expansions first announced in Q3 of last year, which were focused on three countries; Germany, France and South Korea.  By almost doubling our commercial footprint in these countries, we have appreciably increased the frequency and intensity of our calling activities with existing customers and competitive accounts. Our experience is that when we do this, our customers grow faster as they adopt our innovations, and so do we.  Three additional countries have been targeted as the next stage for expansion over the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. We're excited to share with you our broader commercial approach at the upcoming Investor Day.  Our expanding global commercial capability will support the adoption of key innovations, like ProCyte One. Following our first U.S. shipments in late March, ProCyte One\u2019s international launch began in June with inflations and presale customers in France, Germany, UK, and in Southern Europe.  Many of our international geographies are hematology-focused, meaning customers prioritize CBC for patient health assessment. Not surprisingly, we've seen an extremely positive reaction to the ProCyte One introduction in international regions. Customers applauded simplicity and small footprint, while still delivering the excellent accuracy, usability and reliability profile veterinarians and their staff pride so highly. Additionally, we expect a multiplier impact from ProCyte One as chemistry and hematology testing go hand in hand with the additional potential to inspire reference lab and rapid assay business and placed as part of the IDEXX 360 program.  Speaking of rapid assay, we're very pleased with the strong momentum we continue to drive in this business globally. We achieved 20% plus organic growth in the U.S. in q2, while raising customer retention levels to 97% supported by innovations like SNAP Pro. We now have over 80% of SNAP 4Dx customer volume engaged on this platform, which enhances insight and supports practice workflow.  SNAP Pro is also helping to achieve accelerated growth in international regions. In Europe, after installing a clinic\u2019s first SNAP Pro, we see a significant expansion in testing volumes. We look forward to building on the strong momentum supported by continued IDEXX innovation.  We're also excited with the progress we're advancing on our cloud-based software capability. We had another excellent quarter of new software installations with Cornerstone and Neo placements growing 21%, while cloud-based offerings continue to represent the majority of PIMS placement. As we continue to expand our install base, we also continue to drive expansion to profitable recurring services, such as credit card processing, which grew at strong double digit rates organically. Software solutions have taken on significant importance to the effective management of the veterinary practice.  Practices have never been busier and IDEXX integrated easy-to-use software solutions to support patient care and workflow, productivity and communications amongst the care team and with the client. Moreover, IDEXX diagnostic solutions are seamlessly integrated into both our and third party solutions, enabling practices to capture and invoice the full range of activities that veterinarian deliver.  We know that IDEXX customers who use all of our solutions have a higher customer experience and tend to test more and grow faster. Relating to the growing importance of practice software solutions, cloud-based technologies have the potential to make important contributions to the overall software experience of the veterinary clinic.  For example, practice owners are free from the challenges of supporting on-premise IP solutions that include frequent hardware updates. Moreover, providers of cloud-based solutions like IDEXX to provide frequent, seamless updates in an environment that offers security advantages.  Our software capabilities were augmented in Q2 with the acquisition of ezyVet, a fast growing innovative practice information management system that is native cloud-based, used by advanced general practices as well as specialty, emergency and large corporate groups worldwide.  This acquisition complements our PIMS portfolio by providing additional options to practices with more complex needs and enterprise functionality. Customers appreciate ezyVet software for its easy use and rich features. In fact, ezyVet is the number one rated full featured practice management solution with 94% customer satisfaction according to Capterra, an industry standard business software customer review site.  Bringing ezyVet into the IDEXX family also grows our cloud development talent, enabling us to capitalize on the evolving nature of the veterinary clinic software product. With that, I'd like to welcome the ezyVet team to IDEXX. We look forward to working together with you to continue to develop best-in-class software products.  We're also excited about the progress we're driving in our diagnostic imaging business. We saw very strong growth in digital imaging placements in Q2 and strong growth in our backlog, reflecting a continued appreciation of our focus on providing a full range of premier low-dose imaging solutions.  Growth of these placements also supports the expansion of recurring services, including cloud-based services like Web PACS. Our Web PACS subscriptions grew at high-teens rates with much faster growth in premium and unlimited subscription tiers, reflecting the high value and diagnostic insight clinicians derived from IDEXX software solutions. Overall, we're very pleased with our business momentum and optimistic as we continue to respond to the reopening of economies globally.  In terms of IDEXX\u2019s specific plans, we're excited to advance plans to bring more IDEXXs back to the office safely and in ways that ensure business continuity. We anticipate maintaining a more hybrid working environment and appreciate our employees\u2019 flexibility in adapting to new ways of working while continuing to deliver high growth, provide top notch customer service and support our world- class product portfolio.  Before I wrap up my remarks, I\u2019d like to publicly welcome a new leader to IDEXX. Dr. Martin Smith will be joining my leadership team in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Martin brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Cytiva and Pall Corporation, both subsidiaries of Danaher.  He has a strong track record of driving R&D strategy in concert with enterprise strategic initiatives, commercial efforts, and we look forward to Martin leading our world-class R&D organization. Welcome, Martin.  With that, I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way the entire IDEXX team is executing as we are on track for another strong year in 2021 with financial performance aligned with our long-term goals. Our growth and performance reflect a consistent business strategy focused on opportunity development within our core businesses, and our employees continue to execute against this strategy daily.  I look forward to sharing more on our strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, August 12. The event remains virtual due to the evolving nature of COVID-19, and we invite you to register on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.  Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Management; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kerry Bennett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Advanced Analytics; and Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President of Veterinary Software and Services. The event will last approximately three hours. It will conclude with a Q&A session.  That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I guess first question would be on sort of the updated guide and the outlook for the second half of the year. And mostly I want to focus on the P&L. I just want to make sure we have all the moving pieces. It seems like you're expecting some incremental spend, some T&E coming back, some healthcare costs going higher. Could you walk us through the cadence of that and how we expect that to come back? And is that really just tied to sort of going back to prior ways of doing business pre-COVID? Is that some incremental spin on top of that? So what are the investment areas? How that should roll in, in the second half? And sort of what's the plan there going forward as far as an effect [indiscernibe]?\nBrian McKeon: Sure. Thanks, Mike, for your question. On OpEx, we're transitioning into a period now where we're comparing to more control cost levels from the prior year. I think you saw that in the second quarter where the comparable OpEx was up 20%. And we are starting to see some costs come back, things like healthcare accruals were up in the second quarter, we expect that to continue. And as the pandemic conditions hopefully continue to get eased, we expect to see some T&E come back. As well, we're advancing investments. We've talked about the commercial investments, particularly in areas like international and our R&D organization. We're leaning into the positive growth. And overall, we think that will create an environment where we've got sustained higher OpEx growth year-on-year and it will be above the revenue growth, which is now up against tougher compares. So that's really the dynamic that we're working through. I think it's all very healthy. We think we're on track for very good full year performance in terms of margin improvement, and look forward to building off that going forward. But second half, we'll be working through those dynamics.\nMichael Ryskin: And are you seeing any incremental issues of freight costs, transportation cost, any other inflation factors, whether it's sort of on the raw material side or on the human capital side in the market?\nBrian McKeon: Selectively, I wouldn't say it's been a big impact on our business. I think more just managing through keeping up with the high demand has been the bigger challenge for the business. And I think we've been able to manage those dynamics well. So it hasn't been as big a factor for us to date.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And as far as some of the new products you called out, things like ProCyte, can you give us an update on sort of how vets are interacting with the sales force and how some of the nuances are going on? I realize it's been a very different environment launching something during COVID than traditionally. I'm just wondering if you could speak to willingness to uptake and sort of expand the menu offering versus sort of relying on the traditional tools.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Mike. Yes, as we indicated in the remarks, the practices are incredibly busy at this point, maybe never busier. And so they certainly welcome I think new menu, new tools, ProCyte One specifically, that helps with productivity. So the reception has been outstanding. We see in the case of the U.S., about 60% of our visits are now in person. Internationally, it's about 50% or so. So they really welcome the opportunity to reengage what they consider to be trusted advisors and partners in the field. And more and more they're looking to IDEXX to be able to provide the analyzers and software solutions that really help them from the standpoint of not just increasing patient care, which has always been the case, but also really driving staff productivity and communications within the practice and with their clients. So overall very, very positive. And we think that there's really an exceptional long-term opportunity, not just in hematology with the ProCyte One, but the entire in clinic that lab suite, because as you know, hematology and chemistry are also very often in vast majority of cases used together.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks. I will get back in the queue.\nOperator: And our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. I'm curious what you're seeing or assuming in your guidance in terms of the sustainability of growth in clinical visits and just overall veterinary demand trends, what are you seeing on a monthly basis and also quarter-to-date? I'm just curious if the recurring CAG momentum here is holding up on a two-year stack basis, and if there's any sort of seasonal dynamics as well to consider here? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, why don't I start and I think Jay can help with color on what we're seeing at the clinic level. The trends in the sector and in our growth held up very well in the second quarter. The CAG Dx recurring, as you note, on a two-year stack basis, that's the way we like to track it as we're working through some of these compares was a little above 16% is pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q4. And so that's very encouraging. I think we're benefiting from continued solid market trends at the clinic level. The visit number was down a bit Q4 to Q1, but the diagnostic revenue growth on a one-year and a two-year stack basis sustained at very good rates. So all indications are demand is holding up very well and that's informing our full year outlook, the higher end of our outlook ranges for the two-year trends to continue in the second half for CAD Dx recurring. And we obviously have a range because there may be some other dynamics that we don't anticipate that go on, and we're going to learn more as we're working through. Hopefully the economies continue to open, but I think we're very encouraged by the strong trends.\nJay Mazelsky: Just to build on that. Definitely the demand trends remain intact. And I think the execution and our ability to be able to build on that has also been very strong. We saw, as Brian indicated, 60% global two-year CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. And if you break it down by region, it was 15.5% in the U.S. and international and really across all modalities. So the in-clinic, rapid essay and the reference lab business. I think the really positive thing on top of that was just the instrument placement, really strong growth coming off of a strong Q1 and the compare to a depressed level last year. Practices report, as I had indicated earlier, being extremely busy. It's not surprising given a lot of the factors we've talked about in the past, and they're looking more and more to be able to really partner with IDEXX and helping them increase the productivity of care workflow as well as the business itself.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And then just given some of the stepped up investments internationally, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape there? And this goes back also to my bigger question, I guess, that people have is what's the right size for the commercial effort overall? It sounds like you're seeing the growth to justify it. But how are you thinking about in terms of your optimal goal there? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. So we'll talk a bit about that at Investor Day in terms of how we're thinking about the international market and sort of what the end state is, and what the footprint should look like. What I will say is that our international investments, we're doing this on a rolling basis. As I indicated, three countries are behind us and three countries are now on the dock. And lots of -- I think the markets internationally are very robust. Veterinary practices are also busy. And we know that, from the standpoint of best or most optimized loading, we're still far off from where we are in the U.S. just by way of benchmark. We have about 120 accounts or so for per account manager. Internationally, it's a lot less. So we think that the investments internationally offer really good return. There's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of market development still before us. And again, we'll provide a little more specific meat on a bone when we meet in a couple of weeks.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. First question is centered on capacity. In the snapshot in the wellness clinical growth decelerated in a two-year stack basis to roughly 85%. It had been 12% to 13% stacked, again, the wellness the prior three quarters. And I feel sometimes Wall Street takes for granted by sort of the ability of an industry to absorb all the additional demand. We've actually anecdotally heard of some practices turning away new customers. So as market leaders, I\u2019d love to get your thoughts, what are you guys hearing? Are there any capacity constraints going on in the industry that's pushing off wellness tests? And this might be a slight headwind for the industry, as we think about the next handful of quarters.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, Jon, I'll take that. The veterinarians will tell you that they're extremely busy, and that's a good thing. So they at times may find themselves fatigued or not being able to take on new clients, and that's to be expected. Having said that, I think they're very creative at being able to increase the capacity within the practice, if you're doing things like adding staff and that sometimes takes time, increasing the number of exam rooms. I think they're investing in software and diagnostics and other tools that help them be more productive. So there's lots of things that they can do short term as well as intermediate term to be able to increase capacity, extending hours, using reference lab services, which takes some of the pressure off veterinary technicians. So, I think it's largely a good thing. And we're seeing some of the markets work in terms of dynamically being able to react to the increased demand.\nJon Block: Okay. And maybe just part B to that one, a follow up. Are you seeing that translate from the veterinarians\u2019 perspective on raising prices to the pet parent? In other words, the demand\u2019s there. They're actually pushing through price. And does that give you guys an opportunity when we think about 2% to 3% annual price increases to maybe bump that up? And then I'll just ask my second question, if that's okay.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So I mean that's situational. We don't have end market visibility in terms of how they're pricing to their clients. We obviously sell them diagnostic solutions that they markup on that insofar as they may be paying their staff more. I think what is true is their end markets are very robust, in that they do have room to increase prices without necessarily negatively impacting patient demand. But I think that's case by case. I think most practices are taking a long-term view and really they're very loyal, have very good relationships with pet owners, and they want to obviously maintain those. And where they have to raise prices I guess, bottom line is they do. But in most cases, what we're seeing is it is pretty moderate.\nJon Block: Okay. And then my second question, Brian, for you. I think I've got these numbers right, but you raised EPS from 1Q to 2Q and midpoint by $0.25. I think stock comp, tax and FX was $0.12 on the button. And I'm guessing ezy might have been another nickel. But can you talk about the flow through on that remaining 30 million of core revenue increase? It just seems like the incremental is on that 30 million if I run through the math. Is it too dissimilar from corporate averages? Is that true? And maybe is that reflective of what you're alluding to of some of the reinvestments in the business in the back part of the year? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, I think you're bridging math. We did have a couple cents from FX. I think stock comp was $0.06 from where we were. So that was about $0.08 of the $0.25. And the stock comp is the tax effect. I wouldn't know ezy. That is not something that we're -- in fact, that's a bit of a headwind for us as we integrate that acquisition. So the flow through is quite good. In terms of the increase on the full year, it's not fundamentally different than the outlook that we had before. I think we're very pleased to be able to raise the revenue number operationally and the EPS number operationally, and just building on the strong trends that we have in the business and that allows us to also continue to invest towards the future growth opportunities that we try to highlight. And I think we are very encouraged with the strong growth in our international business is reinforcing. That's a great place to invest and can really set us up to sustain the strong growth going forward.\nJon Block: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Brian, maybe going back to your comments on margins. There's obviously been a lot of variability last year and in the first part of this year, just given the different pandemic effects that you guys have felt. So I guess like when we think about operating margins for kind of 2022 and beyond, how should we kind of frame the right jumping off point, kind of assuming that these pandemic effects normalize? I guess what\u2019s sort of the right baseline type margin as we think about the business going forward?\nBrian McKeon: We'll share more on that at Investor Day. I think it will be a similar discussion to dialogues we've had in the past. We think that we can build off the improvements that we were able to drive and will continue to target sort of that 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable improvement over time. The drivers there is the strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, enables us to do things like continue to improve our lab productivity and that's a positive driver for us. Still we think we've got ongoing runway to improve our gross margins. And it enables us to reinvest towards expanding the annuity in our business over the long term, which has been very high return on investment for us. And we try to calibrate that appropriately based on how we can execute and ensuring that we're delivering good financial performance annually. But we look forward to building on this progress. I think we're going to have some -- as we noted, some specific dynamics we\u2019re working through here more just related to compares to the pandemics and some of the cost controls we had in place. But that's a near-term dynamic that we're confident we can manage.\nNathan Rich: Great. And then just a couple of quick follow ups. Brian, I think if I caught the number right, you said that in the second quarter, you were lapping I think $25 million of cost reductions. Did I catch that right? And do you have a comparable number for 3Q and 4Q as we think about cycling the temporary cost reductions from last year?\nBrian McKeon: We implemented at the height of the kind of early phase of the pandemic spread, salary and benefit freezes and a number of other actions, and that was a $25 million reduction to our plan levels. And so it gets a little noisy. As we work through the year, we started reinstating aspects of that. But we basically kept headcount controls in place and benefited from pretty significant year-on-year reductions in things like T&E and in healthcare costs. So, we'll continue to see dynamics from that. I think it was meaningful in Q2 relatively more than the balance of the year, but still something that will play out over the next couple of quarters. And we'll try to help you understand that dynamic as we report our results.\nNathan Rich: Great. And if I could just sneak one more in. You've continued to see the premium or the spread between clinical visits and the CAG Dx growth above that 9% to 10% range that I think had been assumed in guidance at the beginning of the year. Is that still roughly the right range to use for the full year overall? Or just given what you\u2019ve seen develop in the first half, do you think that you could continue to see that slightly higher spread than what you've seen historically?\nBrian McKeon: That's a good question. I think we're very pleased with that. It was about 1,100 basis points in Q2 and it was 900 in Q1. Normalized, it was about 1,000 to 1,100. And if I recall, we had some days effects in there. So we feel quite good about that. I think we've factored that thinking into our guidance range. And as we noted earlier, the high end is really sustaining those kind of trends, the strong two-year growth trends for the back half. So that's clearly a factor that helps to drive our confidence in that number.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, Nate, the way we tend to think about that is it's also I think directly related to our execution, which has been excellent, both from an innovation standpoint and we have lots of new stuff, like ProCyte One and digital cytology and software solutions like ezyVet, and also our commercial expansion. So the market\u2019s doing one thing, and it's a very strong market backdrop. And then our execution and ability to develop these markets is the other factor. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong execution in being able to do that. So we're optimistic.\nNathan Rich: Great. I really appreciate the comments.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ekaterina [ph] on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So the first question is on innovation. And we've obviously seen through very healthy pet ownership and standard of care trends over these past several quarters. Is this making you think any differently about R&D and the type of tests that you're developing, something that perhaps didn't make economic sense for the vet or pet owner previously but makes sense just given the higher willingness to pay? And then the second question is, outside of the U.S., talk a bit about the regional differences you're seeing in both visits and testing utilization as countries are exiting the pandemic? Are there countries where you're seeing better or worst trends? And how do you see that evolving through the year? Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So I'll talk about the innovation piece first. Our investment appetite for innovation has always been very high. We think that innovation at the end of the day produces differentiation and solves really challenging customer problems, both clinically and from a business standpoint. So if you look at 2020 last year, we came out with seven I think significant product and service introductions. And they were all extremely well received by our customers and adopted. So we continue to invest in innovation. We'll talk at Investor Day about our approach and the framework in terms of how we think about it, but it involves platforms and instruments and assays and obviously, software as we've talked about, but also innovation in terms of just business models and our reference lab network. So that's alive and well and continues to be a real focus area for us. In terms of your questions around regional differences and testing utilization, as indicated, we've seen really strong growth across the board. The U.S. and North America has much higher use of diagnostics, and that's something that we think over time we can drive increased market adoption internationally with -- the TAM is about 2x from a potential opportunity standpoint relative to the U.S., and that's a function of more than just commercial expansion. It's a function of really putting in place reference lab network like we've done in Kornwestheim, the centers of excellence and broader set of solutions that customers value so much. You do see some, and I would say modest differences just by country in terms of how they're reacting to the pandemic. So we've seen a little bit lower in-person visits in Europe relative to the U.S. U.S. is about 60%. Europe, for example, was 50%. But our ability to continue to support our customers and customers transacting business hasn't really changed as a result of that. I think they've adopted well to the changing environment, and they're seeing a lot of traffic just like we're seeing in the U.S.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Nick [indiscernible] in for Ryan. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the solid quarter again. Earlier in your comments, you mentioned that about 60% of your visits in the U.S. at least right now are in-person. I'm assuming you're talking about your sales visits? And then if so, how has that kind of been tracking over the last quarter? Has it been kind of steadily going up?\nJay Mazelsky: Right. The 60% does refer to customer facing sales visits. That has gone up from what's plateau about 50% thereabouts at sort of the height of last year is a little bit below 50%. But we adapted very quickly to the changed environment. And obviously, it's a function of how things play out going forward, whether that continues to increase in terms of the Delta variant and some of the procedures local governments have put in place in addition to CDC. But we expect as the pandemic recedes that it will continue to increase our in-person visits, but to be determined.\nUnidentified Analyst: Is that a number that, say, like in a post-COVID era ever returns to 100%, or are you kind of realizing some of the benefits from kind of a virtual sales process such that you'll kind of keep that going on at least for a little bit going forward?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I think there's been some great takeaways in terms of what visits really should be done in person versus where you can support the customer virtually. I think from the standpoint of getting those benefits from a productivity standpoint. I don't think we'd go back to 100%. Having said that, I think what our customers would like to say, given how busy they are is more efficient visits. So at one point, maybe they have time for 45 minutes or an hour, and now they'd like to be able to get them the same amount of work and conversation in 20 minutes or 25 minutes. So we think there's great opportunity there to help them and to increase productivity on both sides of the partnership.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. That's definitely helpful. And then I guess on the visit and practice revenue front, it looks like there is a little kind of variability in what would be revenue per visit quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering if there's any dynamics to kind of call out on that front.\nBrian McKeon: It held up well. I think there's always a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability. Nothing really specifically. We're trying to highlight our trends were quite good. I think vets are very busy. I think that's one thing that we hear gives us a way so that could be a dynamic. But overall, I think the bigger theme is continued strong growth, and we're feeling good about our outlook.\nJay Mazelsky: Okay. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I also want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their continued exceptional performance. We have an amazing purpose as a company and our employees represent our values every day. I couldn't be more appreciative of their efforts and what we accomplished this past quarter.  With that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business.  Revenue increased 30% as reported and 25% organically supported by 26% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international regions. As we work through comparisons to prior year COVID impacts, we'll be highlighting select two-year average annual revenue growth metrics to calibrate our business trends.  In the second quarter, average annual two-year organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was 16%, in line with the strong two-year growth trends in Q4 and Q1. Operating profit increased 30% on a comparable basis in the second quarter, reflecting benefits from high revenue growth and moderate operating margin gains, as we begin to lap the tight cost controls introduced during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020.  High operating profit gains enabled delivery of $2.34 in earnings per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable basis. Continued strong momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver high revenue and profit gains in 2021.  We're raising our full year revenue growth outlook range by $55 million at midpoint to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. This reflects an outlook for reported revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, including favorable impacts from FX changes and benefits from our recent acquisitions. Our updated full year outlook is for 14.5% to 16% overall organic revenue growth and 16% to 17.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These organic growth ranges are 1% to 1.5% higher than our last outlook, reflecting expectations for sustained strong performance in our CAG business globally.  Our full year financial outlook reflects a targeted 175 to 225 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, up 25 basis points from our last outlook as we advance increase investments in our CAG innovation and commercial capability.  We're increasing our EPS outlook to $8.20 to $8.36 per share, up $0.25 per share at midpoint reflecting 25% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook later in my comments.  Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by 27% CAG revenue gains and 27% growth in our water business, benefitted from the lapping of prior year pandemic impacts. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 26% organically reflecting 24% growth in the U.S. and 30% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in the U.S. and 18% growth in international. Strong CAG results were also supported by 78% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues compared to constrained prior year levels. Q2 growth in U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was aided by high year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical visits, benefiting in part from comparisons to lower visit levels in April and May of 2020. U.S. clinical visit growth was 13% overall in Q2 with strong gains across non-wellness and wellness visit categories. On an average two-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.8% annual rate, down modestly from strong Q1 results.  The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 1,100 basis points in the second quarter, up moderately and on track with our full year outlook.  Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 16% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2. Diagnostic revenue per practice increased 15% on a one-year basis and 12% on an average two-year basis in Q2.  Looking ahead to the second half of 2021, as noted in our last call, we expect to see lower levels of one-year growth in U.S. clinical visits and CAG Diagnostic revenue gains, as we lap the significant step up in demand we saw in the second half of 2020. These dynamics are factored into our revenue guidance which projects sustained strong tier growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in H2.  IDEXX innovation and commercial initiatives continue to build on positive healthcare demand trends driving high Q2 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 25% organically in Q2, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 30% growth in international regions.  Our international reference lab gains continue to benefit from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories.  IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the second quarter, also reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and approximately 30% organic gains in international. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to constrained prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 3,756 units, up over 400 units from strong Q1 results and doubled the placement levels seen last year.  The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 308 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 87% year-on-year and 938 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 75%.  We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements, driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base.  We achieved 1,119 premium hematology placements, including hundreds of ProCyte One installs as we advance our global rollout schedule. This supported 11% growth in our global premium hematology install base compared to Q2 2020.  We also placed 662 SediVue, including strong placement levels in international regions under IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment install base by 24%. We're looking forward to building on this momentum as we gain increased direct access at veterinary clinics globally and support strong demand for diagnostic testing.  Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 28% organic growth rate in Q2, reflecting 20% plus gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated 30% plus growth in international geographies. Of note, core vector borne disease retention rates for U.S. rapid assay reached 97% in the quarter, aligned with sustained high IDEXX retention rates across our major modalities.  High CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 26% organically and 33% as reported, including initial benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition.  We saw high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements, driven by favorable customer response to our entry level ImageVue DR30 platform with approximately 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We also continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability.  In our veterinary software services business, we posted double digit organic revenue gains driven by growth in Cornerstone and Neo placements, and strong growth in recurring services. As Jay will discuss, we expanded our cloud-based software capability to our recently announced acquisition of ezyVet, which closed in June. We estimate ezyVet will contribute approximately 15 million to full year 2021 revenues, which is factored into our updated outlook.  Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues increased 27% organically in Q2 compared to 16% declines in last year's second quarter driven by early pandemic-related impacts. We continue to see a solid recovery in demand for water testing as economies reopen including recovery in non-compliance related testing volumes that have been more constrained during the pandemic.  Livestock poultry and dairy revenue decreased 2% organically in Q2. Those results were constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand in key areas such as African swine fever testing. Revenue growth was also impacted by relatively lower herd health screening levels reflecting reduced exports, including effects from restrictions on live animal imports into China.  We're planning on reduced LPE revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021, as we continue to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our ASF programs, and manage through expected pressure on our China LPD business from rebuilding swine herds, low pork prices, and changing government requirements related to livestock infectious disease programs. Turning to the P&L, we had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2, driven primarily by benefits from high year-on-year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We're now starting to work through comparisons to control costs levels in the prior year that were implemented as part of our pandemic contingency management efforts. Despite these dynamics, our strong revenue growth supported the solid 110 basis point expansion of our operating margins on a comparable basis, helping to drive an increase in operating profits of 34% as reported and 30% on a comparable basis.  Gross profit increased 29% in Q2, driven by high revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis, reflecting mixed impacts from higher instrument revenue and moderated lab gross margins gains as we lapped tightly controlled prior year cost levels in key areas such as lab operations. Gross margin gains continue to benefit from strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, including positive impacts for moderate price gains. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains over the balance of this year as we continue to lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels and see impacts from increases in reference lab staffing and capacity, aligned was supporting high revenue growth.  Operating expenses in Q2 increased 24% as reported and 20% on a comparable basis. In Q2 of 2020, we advanced approximately 25 million of cost reductions related to planned levels, including temporary reductions in salary and benefits, and also saw significant cost reductions in other areas such as employee healthcare accruals.  The higher operating expense cost growth in Q2 reflects lapping these dynamics as well as the advancement of investments in our global commercial and innovation capability, aligned with our accelerated revenue growth profile. We anticipate operating expense growth will be higher than revenue growth in the second half of 2021, as these investments and the integration of the ezyVet acquisition advance. We also expect to see relative increases in costs such as employee healthcare claims and travel, as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. Q2 EPS was $2.34 per share, including benefits of 6 million or $0.07 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q2 EPS increased 33%. Foreign exchange added 8 million to operating profits and $0.07 to EPS in Q2 net of 3 million in hedge losses.  Free cash flow was 211 million in the quarter and 316 million for the first half of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 95%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments last year. We're increasing our outlook for full year 2021 capital spending to 150 million to 160 million to reflect additional investments to support manufacturing and distribution growth capacity, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. With this higher level of projected spending, we're updating our free cash flow conversion outlook for the full year to approximately 80% of net income.  Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with 232 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated 188 million in capital to repurchase 341,000 shares in the quarter.  Turning to our 2021 full year outlook, we're increasing our projected revenue range for overall revenue to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. At midpoint, this reflects approximately 30 million in organic operational improvement, approximately 10 million benefits from updated FX assumptions and approximately 15 million in increased full year revenue benefit from acquisitions. Our updated revenue outlook is 17% to 18.5% as reported, including approximately 2% for full year growth benefit from FX at approximately 0.5% benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 14.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 16% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. The high end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range reflects two-year average annual growth rates in line with strong H1 performance levels.  As noted on a one-year growth basis, we expect to see moderation in H2 from very high year-on-year growth rate seen in the first half of this year as you work through the comparison to the acceleration in growth that we saw in the second half of 2020, including fulfillment of pent-up demand in last year's third quarter. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half, and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year as we lapped the benefits over prior initiatives and plan for lower human PCR testing levels.  In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.6% to 29.1%, reflecting increased expectations for 175 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement.  Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.17 of positive full year EPS benefit net of establish hedge positions.  Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.25 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.06 per share higher than our prior projections. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release in earnings snapshot.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Sure. Thanks, Mike, for your question. On OpEx, we're transitioning into a period now where we're comparing to more control cost levels from the prior year. I think you saw that in the second quarter where the comparable OpEx was up 20%. And we are starting to see some costs come back, things like healthcare accruals were up in the second quarter, we expect that to continue. And as the pandemic conditions hopefully continue to get eased, we expect to see some T&E come back. As well, we're advancing investments. We've talked about the commercial investments, particularly in areas like international and our R&D organization. We're leaning into the positive growth. And overall, we think that will create an environment where we've got sustained higher OpEx growth year-on-year and it will be above the revenue growth, which is now up against tougher compares. So that's really the dynamic that we're working through. I think it's all very healthy. We think we're on track for very good full year performance in terms of margin improvement, and look forward to building off that going forward. But second half, we'll be working through those dynamics. Selectively, I wouldn't say it's been a big impact on our business. I think more just managing through keeping up with the high demand has been the bigger challenge for the business. And I think we've been able to manage those dynamics well. So it hasn't been as big a factor for us to date. Yes, why don't I start and I think Jay can help with color on what we're seeing at the clinic level. The trends in the sector and in our growth held up very well in the second quarter. The CAG Dx recurring, as you note, on a two-year stack basis, that's the way we like to track it as we're working through some of these compares was a little above 16% is pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q4. And so that's very encouraging. I think we're benefiting from continued solid market trends at the clinic level. The visit number was down a bit Q4 to Q1, but the diagnostic revenue growth on a one-year and a two-year stack basis sustained at very good rates. So all indications are demand is holding up very well and that's informing our full year outlook, the higher end of our outlook ranges for the two-year trends to continue in the second half for CAD Dx recurring. And we obviously have a range because there may be some other dynamics that we don't anticipate that go on, and we're going to learn more as we're working through. Hopefully the economies continue to open, but I think we're very encouraged by the strong trends. Yes, I think you're bridging math. We did have a couple cents from FX. I think stock comp was $0.06 from where we were. So that was about $0.08 of the $0.25. And the stock comp is the tax effect. I wouldn't know ezy. That is not something that we're -- in fact, that's a bit of a headwind for us as we integrate that acquisition. So the flow through is quite good. In terms of the increase on the full year, it's not fundamentally different than the outlook that we had before. I think we're very pleased to be able to raise the revenue number operationally and the EPS number operationally, and just building on the strong trends that we have in the business and that allows us to also continue to invest towards the future growth opportunities that we try to highlight. And I think we are very encouraged with the strong growth in our international business is reinforcing. That's a great place to invest and can really set us up to sustain the strong growth going forward. We'll share more on that at Investor Day. I think it will be a similar discussion to dialogues we've had in the past. We think that we can build off the improvements that we were able to drive and will continue to target sort of that 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable improvement over time. The drivers there is the strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, enables us to do things like continue to improve our lab productivity and that's a positive driver for us. Still we think we've got ongoing runway to improve our gross margins. And it enables us to reinvest towards expanding the annuity in our business over the long term, which has been very high return on investment for us. And we try to calibrate that appropriately based on how we can execute and ensuring that we're delivering good financial performance annually. But we look forward to building on this progress. I think we're going to have some -- as we noted, some specific dynamics we're working through here more just related to compares to the pandemics and some of the cost controls we had in place. But that's a near-term dynamic that we're confident we can manage. We implemented at the height of the kind of early phase of the pandemic spread, salary and benefit freezes and a number of other actions, and that was a $25 million reduction to our plan levels. And so it gets a little noisy. As we work through the year, we started reinstating aspects of that. But we basically kept headcount controls in place and benefited from pretty significant year-on-year reductions in things like T&E and in healthcare costs. So, we'll continue to see dynamics from that. I think it was meaningful in Q2 relatively more than the balance of the year, but still something that will play out over the next couple of quarters. And we'll try to help you understand that dynamic as we report our results. That's a good question. I think we're very pleased with that. It was about 1,100 basis points in Q2 and it was 900 in Q1. Normalized, it was about 1,000 to 1,100. And if I recall, we had some days effects in there. So we feel quite good about that. I think we've factored that thinking into our guidance range. And as we noted earlier, the high end is really sustaining those kind of trends, the strong two-year growth trends for the back half. So that's clearly a factor that helps to drive our confidence in that number. It held up well. I think there's always a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability. Nothing really specifically. We're trying to highlight our trends were quite good. I think vets are very busy. I think that's one thing that we hear gives us a way so that could be a dynamic. But overall, I think the bigger theme is continued strong growth, and we're feeling good about our outlook."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong results supported by continued favorable trends in our core CAG business and excellent execution by the IDEXX team. As noted, we delivered 25% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by high organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth.  There were strong gains across all CAG business segments and testing modalities, representing a continuation of the accelerated growth trends we've seen since the second half of 2020. Strong sector growth and outstanding execution by the IDEXX team gives us confidence to raise our 2021 financial outlook, as we continue to invest towards our significant long-term growth opportunity.  Today, I'll provide a brief update on the trends we're seeing in key regions in our companion animal sector and discuss the status of our initiatives to strengthen our international commercial capabilities.  I'll also share an update on our ProCyte One launch and growing software portfolio, including the ezyVet acquisition which will better position us to capitalize on favorable tailwinds, further enhance practice productivity and raise the standard of patient care.  Let me start with an update on sector trends. Global sector trends remained favorable in the second quarter reflected, for example, in sustained high U.S. clinical visit levels that support continued strong increases in veterinary service revenues, including diagnostics. As Brian noted, U.S. clinical visits increased 13% in the quarter and 4.8% on a two-year average annual basis, with continued strong gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This growth was supported by growing pet population and veterinarians focus on medical services, which has sustained even as pandemic restrictions have eased. The solid trends we're seeing across all global regions in Q2, our strong commercial execution is building on this momentum, reflected in IDEXX CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 26% on a one-year basis and 16% on a two-year average annual basis.  Within the clinic, veterinarians and the teams continued to rise to the challenge of increased demand, working hard to keep up with industry growth, while also delivering excellent patient care to ever more engaged pet parents. IDEXX is well positioned to provide them the tools and services necessary to meet these demands, supporting 15% diagnostics revenue growth per practice, and even faster growth for IDEXX revenues. Overall, we feel very positive about the strong sector backdrop, our strategy to bring testing and information management innovation to the practice and our team's level of execution, which is reflected in our raised full year revenue outlook.  In terms of execution, our commercial team continues to deliver exceptional results despite continued constraint clinic access. Instrument placements showed increased momentum in the second quarter, with over 3,750 total premium placements, up solidly from a strong Q1, helping to drive 14% growth in our premium worldwide install base for the quarter.  This included double digit growth in premium chemistry, hematology and urine analysis and cell basis, as well as continued excellent growth in new and competitive accounts. Veterinary customers are extremely busy due to high visit volumes, and they're investing in IDEXX instruments, diagnostics and tools to support practice growth, patient care and staff productivity.  Our digital cytology solution is an excellent example of this point and innovative service that extends the capability and reach of the practice. By providing cytology testing results in the U.S. with a report authored by expert pathologists in under two hours at any time during the day or week, 365 days a year, veterinarians are able to provide a higher standard of care to their patients, improve staff and clinical productivity, and drive appropriate testing and practice revenues. Validating this medical value proposition, we saw strong customer interest in orders for a digital cytology solution Q2. We also continue to advance key programs, like IDEXX preventive care that helped clinics raise the standard of care aligned with higher levels of pet owner engagement. In Q2, we executed 150 new preventive care enrollments as we continue to advance towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In terms of customer access, we continue to operate in a hybrid model, with access to a limited but improving in both the U.S. and international regions. In the U.S., approximately 60% of customer visits were in-person in q2, whereas it was approximately 50% in Europe. This hasn't impacted our ability to deliver outstanding results as both new innovations and our excellent relationships we have with customers have driven significant growth across all regions.  The deep customer relationships with our sales professionals have only been reinforced and strengthened by the best-in-class support we provided to customers throughout the pandemic. Of note, we're particularly pleased with our high levels of execution in regions like Europe, where we are expanding the successful go-to-market approaches we've applied in the U.S.  This was reflected in 400 catalysts placements in new and competitive accounts outside of North America, with half of these placements under IDEXX 360 agreements. The expansion to the IDEXX 360 program is also supporting sustained strong gains and lab revenues in Europe, accelerating new account acquisition and helping to inspire faster customer growth at IDEXX 360 customers.  A key focus of our strategy in this context is on developing the long-term international revenue opportunity through an expansion of our direct commercial presence. We've completed the commercial expansions first announced in Q3 of last year, which were focused on three countries; Germany, France and South Korea.  By almost doubling our commercial footprint in these countries, we have appreciably increased the frequency and intensity of our calling activities with existing customers and competitive accounts. Our experience is that when we do this, our customers grow faster as they adopt our innovations, and so do we.  Three additional countries have been targeted as the next stage for expansion over the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. We're excited to share with you our broader commercial approach at the upcoming Investor Day.  Our expanding global commercial capability will support the adoption of key innovations, like ProCyte One. Following our first U.S. shipments in late March, ProCyte One's international launch began in June with inflations and presale customers in France, Germany, UK, and in Southern Europe.  Many of our international geographies are hematology-focused, meaning customers prioritize CBC for patient health assessment. Not surprisingly, we've seen an extremely positive reaction to the ProCyte One introduction in international regions. Customers applauded simplicity and small footprint, while still delivering the excellent accuracy, usability and reliability profile veterinarians and their staff pride so highly. Additionally, we expect a multiplier impact from ProCyte One as chemistry and hematology testing go hand in hand with the additional potential to inspire reference lab and rapid assay business and placed as part of the IDEXX 360 program.  Speaking of rapid assay, we're very pleased with the strong momentum we continue to drive in this business globally. We achieved 20% plus organic growth in the U.S. in q2, while raising customer retention levels to 97% supported by innovations like SNAP Pro. We now have over 80% of SNAP 4Dx customer volume engaged on this platform, which enhances insight and supports practice workflow.  SNAP Pro is also helping to achieve accelerated growth in international regions. In Europe, after installing a clinic's first SNAP Pro, we see a significant expansion in testing volumes. We look forward to building on the strong momentum supported by continued IDEXX innovation.  We're also excited with the progress we're advancing on our cloud-based software capability. We had another excellent quarter of new software installations with Cornerstone and Neo placements growing 21%, while cloud-based offerings continue to represent the majority of PIMS placement. As we continue to expand our install base, we also continue to drive expansion to profitable recurring services, such as credit card processing, which grew at strong double digit rates organically. Software solutions have taken on significant importance to the effective management of the veterinary practice.  Practices have never been busier and IDEXX integrated easy-to-use software solutions to support patient care and workflow, productivity and communications amongst the care team and with the client. Moreover, IDEXX diagnostic solutions are seamlessly integrated into both our and third party solutions, enabling practices to capture and invoice the full range of activities that veterinarian deliver.  We know that IDEXX customers who use all of our solutions have a higher customer experience and tend to test more and grow faster. Relating to the growing importance of practice software solutions, cloud-based technologies have the potential to make important contributions to the overall software experience of the veterinary clinic.  For example, practice owners are free from the challenges of supporting on-premise IP solutions that include frequent hardware updates. Moreover, providers of cloud-based solutions like IDEXX to provide frequent, seamless updates in an environment that offers security advantages.  Our software capabilities were augmented in Q2 with the acquisition of ezyVet, a fast growing innovative practice information management system that is native cloud-based, used by advanced general practices as well as specialty, emergency and large corporate groups worldwide.  This acquisition complements our PIMS portfolio by providing additional options to practices with more complex needs and enterprise functionality. Customers appreciate ezyVet software for its easy use and rich features. In fact, ezyVet is the number one rated full featured practice management solution with 94% customer satisfaction according to Capterra, an industry standard business software customer review site.  Bringing ezyVet into the IDEXX family also grows our cloud development talent, enabling us to capitalize on the evolving nature of the veterinary clinic software product. With that, I'd like to welcome the ezyVet team to IDEXX. We look forward to working together with you to continue to develop best-in-class software products.  We're also excited about the progress we're driving in our diagnostic imaging business. We saw very strong growth in digital imaging placements in Q2 and strong growth in our backlog, reflecting a continued appreciation of our focus on providing a full range of premier low-dose imaging solutions.  Growth of these placements also supports the expansion of recurring services, including cloud-based services like Web PACS. Our Web PACS subscriptions grew at high-teens rates with much faster growth in premium and unlimited subscription tiers, reflecting the high value and diagnostic insight clinicians derived from IDEXX software solutions. Overall, we're very pleased with our business momentum and optimistic as we continue to respond to the reopening of economies globally.  In terms of IDEXX's specific plans, we're excited to advance plans to bring more IDEXXs back to the office safely and in ways that ensure business continuity. We anticipate maintaining a more hybrid working environment and appreciate our employees' flexibility in adapting to new ways of working while continuing to deliver high growth, provide top notch customer service and support our world- class product portfolio.  Before I wrap up my remarks, I'd like to publicly welcome a new leader to IDEXX. Dr. Martin Smith will be joining my leadership team in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Martin brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Cytiva and Pall Corporation, both subsidiaries of Danaher.  He has a strong track record of driving R&D strategy in concert with enterprise strategic initiatives, commercial efforts, and we look forward to Martin leading our world-class R&D organization. Welcome, Martin.  With that, I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way the entire IDEXX team is executing as we are on track for another strong year in 2021 with financial performance aligned with our long-term goals. Our growth and performance reflect a consistent business strategy focused on opportunity development within our core businesses, and our employees continue to execute against this strategy daily.  I look forward to sharing more on our strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, August 12. The event remains virtual due to the evolving nature of COVID-19, and we invite you to register on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.  Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Management; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kerry Bennett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Advanced Analytics; and Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President of Veterinary Software and Services. The event will last approximately three hours. It will conclude with a Q&A session.  That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for questions. Good morning, Mike. Yes, as we indicated in the remarks, the practices are incredibly busy at this point, maybe never busier. And so they certainly welcome I think new menu, new tools, ProCyte One specifically, that helps with productivity. So the reception has been outstanding. We see in the case of the U.S., about 60% of our visits are now in person. Internationally, it's about 50% or so. So they really welcome the opportunity to reengage what they consider to be trusted advisors and partners in the field. And more and more they're looking to IDEXX to be able to provide the analyzers and software solutions that really help them from the standpoint of not just increasing patient care, which has always been the case, but also really driving staff productivity and communications within the practice and with their clients. So overall very, very positive. And we think that there's really an exceptional long-term opportunity, not just in hematology with the ProCyte One, but the entire in clinic that lab suite, because as you know, hematology and chemistry are also very often in vast majority of cases used together. Just to build on that. Definitely the demand trends remain intact. And I think the execution and our ability to be able to build on that has also been very strong. We saw, as Brian indicated, 60% global two-year CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. And if you break it down by region, it was 15.5% in the U.S. and international and really across all modalities. So the in-clinic, rapid essay and the reference lab business. I think the really positive thing on top of that was just the instrument placement, really strong growth coming off of a strong Q1 and the compare to a depressed level last year. Practices report, as I had indicated earlier, being extremely busy. It's not surprising given a lot of the factors we've talked about in the past, and they're looking more and more to be able to really partner with IDEXX and helping them increase the productivity of care workflow as well as the business itself. Sure. So we'll talk a bit about that at Investor Day in terms of how we're thinking about the international market and sort of what the end state is, and what the footprint should look like. What I will say is that our international investments, we're doing this on a rolling basis. As I indicated, three countries are behind us and three countries are now on the dock. And lots of -- I think the markets internationally are very robust. Veterinary practices are also busy. And we know that, from the standpoint of best or most optimized loading, we're still far off from where we are in the U.S. just by way of benchmark. We have about 120 accounts or so for per account manager. Internationally, it's a lot less. So we think that the investments internationally offer really good return. There's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of market development still before us. And again, we'll provide a little more specific meat on a bone when we meet in a couple of weeks. Yes, Jon, I'll take that. The veterinarians will tell you that they're extremely busy, and that's a good thing. So they at times may find themselves fatigued or not being able to take on new clients, and that's to be expected. Having said that, I think they're very creative at being able to increase the capacity within the practice, if you're doing things like adding staff and that sometimes takes time, increasing the number of exam rooms. I think they're investing in software and diagnostics and other tools that help them be more productive. So there's lots of things that they can do short term as well as intermediate term to be able to increase capacity, extending hours, using reference lab services, which takes some of the pressure off veterinary technicians. So, I think it's largely a good thing. And we're seeing some of the markets work in terms of dynamically being able to react to the increased demand. Yes. So I mean that's situational. We don't have end market visibility in terms of how they're pricing to their clients. We obviously sell them diagnostic solutions that they markup on that insofar as they may be paying their staff more. I think what is true is their end markets are very robust, in that they do have room to increase prices without necessarily negatively impacting patient demand. But I think that's case by case. I think most practices are taking a long-term view and really they're very loyal, have very good relationships with pet owners, and they want to obviously maintain those. And where they have to raise prices I guess, bottom line is they do. But in most cases, what we're seeing is it is pretty moderate. Yes, Nate, the way we tend to think about that is it's also I think directly related to our execution, which has been excellent, both from an innovation standpoint and we have lots of new stuff, like ProCyte One and digital cytology and software solutions like ezyVet, and also our commercial expansion. So the market's doing one thing, and it's a very strong market backdrop. And then our execution and ability to develop these markets is the other factor. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong execution in being able to do that. So we're optimistic. Yes. So I'll talk about the innovation piece first. Our investment appetite for innovation has always been very high. We think that innovation at the end of the day produces differentiation and solves really challenging customer problems, both clinically and from a business standpoint. So if you look at 2020 last year, we came out with seven I think significant product and service introductions. And they were all extremely well received by our customers and adopted. So we continue to invest in innovation. We'll talk at Investor Day about our approach and the framework in terms of how we think about it, but it involves platforms and instruments and assays and obviously, software as we've talked about, but also innovation in terms of just business models and our reference lab network. So that's alive and well and continues to be a real focus area for us. In terms of your questions around regional differences and testing utilization, as indicated, we've seen really strong growth across the board. The U.S. and North America has much higher use of diagnostics, and that's something that we think over time we can drive increased market adoption internationally with -- the TAM is about 2x from a potential opportunity standpoint relative to the U.S., and that's a function of more than just commercial expansion. It's a function of really putting in place reference lab network like we've done in Kornwestheim, the centers of excellence and broader set of solutions that customers value so much. You do see some, and I would say modest differences just by country in terms of how they're reacting to the pandemic. So we've seen a little bit lower in-person visits in Europe relative to the U.S. U.S. is about 60%. Europe, for example, was 50%. But our ability to continue to support our customers and customers transacting business hasn't really changed as a result of that. I think they've adopted well to the changing environment, and they're seeing a lot of traffic just like we're seeing in the U.S. Right. The 60% does refer to customer facing sales visits. That has gone up from what's plateau about 50% thereabouts at sort of the height of last year is a little bit below 50%. But we adapted very quickly to the changed environment. And obviously, it's a function of how things play out going forward, whether that continues to increase in terms of the Delta variant and some of the procedures local governments have put in place in addition to CDC. But we expect as the pandemic recedes that it will continue to increase our in-person visits, but to be determined. Yes. I think there's been some great takeaways in terms of what visits really should be done in person versus where you can support the customer virtually. I think from the standpoint of getting those benefits from a productivity standpoint. I don't think we'd go back to 100%. Having said that, I think what our customers would like to say, given how busy they are is more efficient visits. So at one point, maybe they have time for 45 minutes or an hour, and now they'd like to be able to get them the same amount of work and conversation in 20 minutes or 25 minutes. So we think there's great opportunity there to help them and to increase productivity on both sides of the partnership. Okay. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I also want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their continued exceptional performance. We have an amazing purpose as a company and our employees represent our values every day. I couldn't be more appreciative of their efforts and what we accomplished this past quarter.  With that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter result and to provide an update on our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. The operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow-through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre-COVID operating expense levels. These dynamics and a higher than expected $0.17 per share in stock based compensation tax benefit enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. Our strong start to the year has increased our comp and has been achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full-year revenue outlook range by 40 million to $3,105 million to $3,160 million, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. This reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at mid-point than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full-year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 basis point to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. We'll update or we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results in recent market trends. First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African Swine Fever testing in China, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues expanded the high growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong two-year growth trends we saw on the second half of 2020. On a two-year basis, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 70% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting two-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1; including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a two-year basis, same store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter, or approximately 1,000 basis points to 1,100 basis points adjusted for [equivalent day effects]. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected sustained strong 9% growth in non-wellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth, and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. Our continued focus on expanded pet healthcare services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same store increase in diagnostic revenues for practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. Positive market dynamics benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 22% organically in Q1, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence, and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continued to be driven by high same store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrain prior levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high growth in demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America, and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year [increase of 15%]. We also benefited from 464 second Catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVue\u2019s including strong placement levels at international markets leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our [premium earned in settlement] installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we drive in expanding our in-clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement and sales access to veterinary clinics globally, and advanced the global launch of ProCyte One. Rapid assay revenues also expanded a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing, and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid asset customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. go direct effort since 2014. Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAD business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth and new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in early regeneration instrument platform sales. Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1, compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement and non-compliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. Q1 results saw approximately 2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in [China], supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward, particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior demand for African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. Turning to the P&L, we had strong profit flow through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales, and benefits from moderate net price gains. We\u2019re planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we [lab tightly] controlled prior spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported, and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show, and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward, as we lap comparisons to control prior year OpEx levels, and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs as we work through the year in pandemic related restrictions are raised. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of 15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added 10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was 104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending, an extension of tax payments. For the full-year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0 times gross and 0.6 times net of cash, [the] 350 million in cash and no borrowings and a $1 billion revolving credit facility. We re-initiated share repurchases in Q1 allocating 154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook, we're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5%, as reported. This reflects at 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range offset by approximately $5 million and refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full-year growth benefit this year, at the rate shared in our press release. Our updated organic, overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG DX recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same store U.S. clinic clinical visit growth for the full-year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 basis to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over 50 million of operational revenue [upside] is being moderated by relatively more conservative full-year projections for IDEXX [human COVID] testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior year initiatives and plan for moderation and testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect to increase local competition in China, including \u2013 and our African swine fever testing business. Combined, these effects resulted in 0.5% headwind, compared to earlier overall 20 2021 organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 basis points to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedged positions. Our full-year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. We provided details and our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. \nJay Mazelsky: Thanks, Brian and good morning. IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through supported by 23% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we seek to develop the global market for companion animal health care, and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook, just a little over 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets. And our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX, innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I\u2019ll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to capitalize our market tailwinds and position the company to deliver continued strong financial returns. Let's begin with an update on market trends.  Companion animal healthcare continues to see strong global market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits, and continued high growth in services supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter with non-wellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%, with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to critical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kittens and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and kittens. If we do our job well with programs like preventive care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well pets and continue to expand diagnostics usage through life stages, thereby helping advanced standards of care.  In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including Bloodwork. The percentage of clinical visits with Bloodwork increased approximately 1% to 18% in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase.  Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer [indiscernible] doing more testing. With gains across wellness and non-wellness Bloodwork utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics has significant potential for further growth. In increased focus on services and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth and veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same store total practice revenues increased 15% versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice, and 21% growth in diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEXX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth and placement in new and competitive accounts. A key area focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurrent organic revenue growth internationally in Q1 with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America, despite continued restrictions and sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs and key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Kornwestheim, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. The International commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress the plan with a goal of completing on-boarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEXX and international markets reinforces the high return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next generation hematology analyzer ProCyte One. I\u2019m was very proud of the extended team, including our Westbrook, Maine based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic, to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics that participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One\u2019s exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly at best-in-class experience. ProCyte One also represents the next step for IDEXX in providing leading edge technology integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAG growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and as part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive reference lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipment to the clinics that took advantage of our pre-sales program, while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our [sales rep] through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. The [SNAP Pro instrument] is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point of care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the SNAP Platform, a smart service connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever, so providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time, while maintaining accurate records. SNAP Pro provides a tool to address these needs and does help drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using SNAP Pro and are connected to smart service with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which help to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year. With two [indiscernible] PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Web PACS saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels over 96%. We received consistent praise from subscribers about usability, value, and support to the Web PACS system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high growth market. Through our PIMS tools, through our PIMS and tools like SmartFlow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like Web PACS, our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever with clinics managing a significant portion of visits curbside. Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of our key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care in annual wellness testing to the IDEXX preventive care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, to more predictable schedule, and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone, as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerated in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in Vector-borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand Vector-borne disease testing in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S. Shifting its balance to a full Vector-borne disease screening using 40x plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus in strong underlying market trends help to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x plus and fee-line retrovirus tests. As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation in partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top notch service levels in prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions. And we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. We anticipate more flexibility in the future, and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We're on track for strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks. And we now have time for some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong quarter guys. To start, I want to ask on, I want to focus on some of the OpEx side of things, obviously, a gray quarter here. And on the margin side and coming out of the gate, but Brian and Jay, you both had comments in you prepared remarks sort of on how to manage spend going forward, both from the fact that you're going to be lapping some easier comps, but also that you want to invest into the growth in the business. I think you mentioned, you know, adding on some staffing on the reference lab side. Could you expand on that a little bit? And is there anything on the [CAG feel based] personnel, just sort of how should we think about, you know, reinvesting some of the gains the business to support the growth for the rest of the year.\nBrian McKeon : Mike, why don't I start by, just kind of, framing the comparisons that we're trying to highlight as we move forward, because that's a key dynamic? We're just trying to reinforce. Clearly we had very strong profit results in Q1. We are going to start entering a period here where we're going to be comparing ourselves to the control spending levels that we implemented last year. So, if you recall, we had 25 million of OpEx savings that we highlighted second quarter, another 5 million of savings from lower health care costs. We really, in the early stages of the pandemic tried to be very mindful of how we're controlling labor costs in areas like the labs, and so we're just trying to highlight as we move forward.  We're going to see, you know, some of those comparison effects moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, as a benchmark just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs [in T&E], which is about 7% of OpEx growth. So, moving forward, we won't have those kind of favorability. So, we're just trying to highlight that. And we're also trying to highlight that we're advancing investment in the business. So, maybe Jay can talk a bit about that.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, sure. So, just a couple things to build on Brian's comments. Obviously, we're in a high growth environment, there's excellent opportunity to continue to support that growth. We do that, obviously, in areas like reference labs and production, and field support. And the other area of opportunity for us is just our international markets. We've identified this as being very attractive and we continue to advance our expansions where it makes sense. We know that there's pretty good short-term return on those expansions. We have, I think, really optimized our ability to identify all the right pieces you need to have in place, including additional field, personnel, reference labs, information technology, investments, those type of things. So, we're very optimistic about the opportunity, short-term and long-term in our markets, U.S., as well as international and will continue to advances as we see opportunities before us.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks. And then if I could throw on a follow up, sort of on some of the underlying figures you provide for market conditions, as always, the snapshot is very helpful in terms of visit growth and revenue growth for practices. I'm just curious, you know, looking at it on one more granularity, it seems like you're actually seeing continued acceleration from 4Q, you know, both on a raw number spaces and even if you adjust for some of the comp, I think, I guess I would say that we were expecting a little bit more moderation and maybe a gradual phase as you go through the year. But it seems like there's no indication of that. Is that a fair analysis of the data? Have you seen anything that would indicate that things are moderating a little bit as some of these markets, sort of come out from COVID, and we're seeing some reopening of the economy? Just wondered if you could talk about, sort of the underlying trends there?\nBrian McKeon : I would say, overall, Mike, the theme would be more consistency than change. What we saw in 2020 was an improvement. If you break down the drivers of things like CAG Diagnostic revenue growth in the clinic, we saw higher levels of contribution from frequency and utilization, and those have sustained. If there was one thing that improved a bit in Q1, which we highlighted in the comments was the new patient contribution to clinical visit growth was up about 100 basis points. So, I think some of the, you know, the building effect of the new puppies and kittens helped, but, you know, adjusting for that the two-year growth rates were largely consistent with Q4. It was more consistency than change. We're entering a period now where we'll have the, you know, the COVID compares, you know, because, you know, the growth rate numbers are a little tougher to follow. So, we're trying to highlight some of the two year trends. And, you know, I think we're encouraged that the two-year trends are holding up well, and you know, that's factored into our outlook for the balance of the year.\nJay Mazelsky: I would just add to that Mike. The trends we described, the broader level trends we've described have largely been intact. So, these are obviously new critical business growth driven by new patients. The majority of which are puppies and kittens, higher usage and intensity of diagnostics and more of a pivot to services by the veterinarians. For those that we have seen over the last, you know, second half of 2020, we continue to see in Q1.\nBrian McKeon: One thing I\u2019d highlight in addition to the market trends is, in terms of IDEXX\u2019s execution, our international teams are really doing an excellent job. We had excellent instrument placements, you know, growth in 360. I think the global commercial model that we've been looking to leverage and build upon is really, really in a good place. And we're very pleased with the international momentum. So, we wanted to highlight that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. So, you gave some incremental charts in the snapshot this time where the percentage of clinical visits, including the Bloodwork increased by 1%. So that seems like an acceleration from the prior trends even seen on an annual basis, but was this driven mostly by the greater proportion of acute visits during the pandemic? And how should we be thinking about that acceleration continuing with potentially greater adoption of preventative care measures, as well as other initiatives in a post pandemic world?\nJay Mazelsky: I'll make a couple comments about that, Erin. So the use of Bloodwork has \u2013 the growth rate has approximately doubled as we talked about a percent in 2020 and versus about 0.5% the previous year. And so there's a number of things that are driving that. We've seen greater proportion of the higher users of diagnostics continue to increase. And we see that very optimistically, as evidence that even those who were at the higher range from a [dead cell] standpoint of diagnostic users feel like there's a lot more capacity. We also see \u2013 as part of clinical visits, greater use of diagnostics, and then when they use them, greater intensity has also gone up. So, all those factors are playing into it. And we think that they'll sustain three plus quarters.\nErin Wright: Okay, great and then on ProCyte One, can you provide an update on traction there? Do you anticipate that accelerating throughout the year and how is that tracking relative to your internal expectations at this point?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, we're very excited and optimistic about ProCyte One. It's been a very successful roll-out. There things \u2013 there's a time and distance dimension to these, you know, as we roll-out a new analyzer in terms of building volume in production, create awareness, in the marketplace. You know, the exciting thing about ProCyte One is the opportunity itself is very significant. We think that there are 100,000 plus opportunities for placements in the hematology market, but there's also a nice multiplier impact where if there's hematology, there's chemistry. So, we tend to place those together. There's, as part of IDEXX 360 there's pull-through in terms of, you know, the reference labs and rapid essay, not just the U.S. now, but internationally. And so, we're excited by the opportunity. I think our experience, our customer experience trials have given us a lot of confidence that the analyzer has hit the mark, both in terms of usability and performance, and we expect our ramp to grow throughout the year. And especially, so internationally as we release late Q2, early Q3 pending on things like regulatory approvals.\nErin Wright: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJon Block: Thanks, good morning. Maybe two questions from me. Brian, the first one's a little long both for you. I think a level of year-over-year gross margin expansion, I think you said you expect the year-over-year level to moderate, but just to be clear, does it stay in this, you know, low 60% range? And then on the balance sheet, the leverage, I think you call that 0.6 net. That might be the lowest level I can remember since you came in the CFO and started to flex it a bit. You've got a couple of big CapEx build-outs. It's now behind you in Germany, and Westbrook. So, just maybe you can comment on how we think about cap deployment going forward? And then I just got a quick follow-up.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. On your first question on gross margin, we are seeing a really nice flow through and obviously the high CAG DX recurring mix and just the strong growth were is helping, we do anticipate, Jon, we're going to be adding back some costs here to keep up with the growth, particularly in things like lab staffing. And then we'll have, you know, some compares just to the, as I mentioned on a year-over-year basis, but we're still anticipating a high level of gross margin flow through and that's factored into our outlook. And on leverage, you're correct, we've, you know, we're quite disciplined last year in terms of pausing, share repurchases, and really controlling our capital spending. Our capital spending on an annual basis was below, kind of the normal levels that we typically have. And we deferred some projects. And we're \u2013 you will see a step up in that as we move forward, not a change fundamentally in our long-term view, but just, you know, catching up on some of the deferred capital spending. And right now, we're just signaling maintaining the kind of net leverage ratios that you see. We did initiate buybacks in Q1, and feel good about sustaining those. So \u2013 but not trying to signal any change to the leverage profile at this point.\nJon Block: Okay. Got it. Very helpful then. Huge quarter, but we got to try to anticipate some of the potential push back. And the only thing that I can try to identify is, you mentioned the 900 basis, point U.S. CAG recurring premium to clinical visit growth, you know, that's down from the 1,600 and 1,200 premium I n 3Q and 4Q 2020, respectively, I think you said they adjusted it was closer to 1,000 or 1,100 bips, but any thoughts on why that slight moderation? You know, Jay, maybe in light of the Vets, as you mentioned, still focusing a lot more on services at their practices? And how do we think about the premium going forward, is it still in that 1,000 bip range? Thanks, guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, you know, Jon, there's always a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter. We think that 900 plus, you know premium is, it's what we've seen over the last quarters in 2020 and we think that that is sustainable. I think it's a reflection of a couple of different things. Obviously, the pivot to services, which if anything has accelerated as part of the COVID response in clinics, but it's also in response that our strategy as a company around innovation, the commercial partnership with our customers in bringing testing relevant testing practices.  And so, we think that that's a successful formula. And it's supportive of what veterinarians and pet owners want to see in terms of better patient care, better \u2013 higher standards of care for patients. And that will continue to be a focus for us from a commercial and innovation strategy standpoint.\nBrian McKeon: And Jon, Jon, one thing I'd highlight too, I know you're looking quarter-by-quarter, but Q3, I think you need to factor in there. There was some pent-up demand likely effects and so I think the overall trend is very healthy. It\u2019s at the higher-end of our outlook. It's above where it was pre-COVID. We feel very good about the growth and services trend as being sustainable to something that's going to, you know enhance our growth profile.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I actually wanted to start with the follow-up to John's question on the CAG DX guidance. Brian, I think you said it was up 2%, relative to the prior outlook. I would just be curious to get some more details on the underlying assumptions around visit growth and increases in diagnostic utilization. I think you had talked about, kind of 2% to 5% visit growth for the year previously, and then that 9% to 10% premium that was just referenced. So, I\u2019d just be curious if you have any, kind of updated assumptions, as we think about the balance of the year on those metrics?\nBrian McKeon: Sure. [Indiscernible] started a little higher level with the global numbers, but made our \u2013 our updated range, the higher-end of the CAG DX recurring range, basically assumed similar two year growth trends to what we saw in Q4 and Q1. So, it's largely in-line with that. And I think that, that is the primary driver of the update. I think is the \u2013 just, you know, more competence coming through Q1 on sustainability of some of the trends and some positive dynamics with critical visit growth. And so that's more of the headline. We're still maintaining, you know, a range, because that may moderate. You know, we may see some pullback. We're going to be up against some compares here. But I think, on balance, we feel very good about the trends. And if anything, they improved a bit in Q1. And as a benchmark, we do try to highlight that U.S. clinical visit growth, and premium dynamic that you mentioned and our initial estimates were 2% to 5% for the full-year. For clinical visit growth, that's a one-year basis and the 900 basis point to 1,000 basis point premium.  And I did mention that our updated outlook reflects that we're trending at the higher-end on clinical visits. And that we're reinforcing the premium outlook, which is right in-line with where we were in Q1. So, you know, I think the, you know, just the underlying market trends have sustained. We feel good about that, and we are seeing that globally. And I think we feel very good about our execution. And now of course have things like ProCyte One to innovation issues that'll help us build on that momentum.\nNathan Rich: Great, that's helpful. If I could just ask a quick follow up on ProCyte One, you know, can you talk about, I guess, maybe Jay, you know, the placements that you've seen so far or maybe the orders that you're getting, you know, how many of those are in new or competitive accounts versus with existing customers? And can you maybe just talk about the opportunity to use, kind of ProCyte One as maybe a lever to get into practices that IDEXX is in currently?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, so it's early in the rollout, but we're very pleased. It's been a very successful route, very successful customer experience trials, and not easy to do, by the way, in the middle of a pandemic. This is a complex instrument, and it has a world-class user interface and performs at a very high level from just an accuracy standpoint. You know, we've identified the hematology opportunity as very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means is, if they have a choice in terms of, if it's one instrument, or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology, even before chemistry, even when they have both. So, in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it, you know, almost 100,000 placement, opportunities, two-thirds plus of which is internationally. But you know, even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry in hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So, having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, you know, hits a sweet spot. The market is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that capital placement piece is the [indiscernible], and there\u2019s pull-through on reference labs and rapid essay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitments. So, we're excited by the overall attack diagnostics opportunity that ProCyte One represents. It\u2019s going to have, you know, we think a very long tail both duration, as well as, you know, overall volume opportunity. So, more to come over time.\nOperator: And our last question is from Balaji Prasad from Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Thank you. Sorry, juggling different calls. Thanks for the question. So, just two-fold questions for me. One, pretty broad level one, trying to understand a defective growth, was there any element of growth coming through market share gains in this quarter or was it all what we could perceive broader industry growth, led by wizards and increasing utilization? And secondly, our Vet survey indicated at 200 basis points jump in [YoY] revenue contributions for clinics, from diagnostics, does that sound too as right and are aligned with your internal tracking? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: So, you know, our markets are very competitive, they have always been very competitive. You know, we\u2019re pleased with what we've been able to advancing our commercial agenda. You know, we\u2019ve shared some data new and competitive placements with catalysts, both in North America, as well as international. So, you can, you know, make your own assumptions in terms of what that means. Our focus is just continuing to support and serve our customers with IDEXX Solutions. We do that both on a instrument side, obviously, the broader diagnostic solutions and software. And what we find is, when customers use all of our solutions, they grow faster, they tend to stay with us longer, and they find it supports their practice needs. In terms of the survey you're mentioning, I'm not familiar with that. So, I'm just going to withhold comment not knowing the underlying methodology.\nBalaji Prasad: Fair enough. Thank you. Maybe a specific comment, if you could throw some lights on what you're seeing with \u2013 since the launch of VETSCAN Imagyst in Q4, and if it is disrupting the market, and what you\u2019re seeing on the clinic side, in terms of comments?\nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, you know, the thing to keep, I think you\u2019re asking a question more generally about the fecal detection. And, you know, our belief is that the fecal antigen test that we offer at the reference lab is best-in-class. It detects up to two times as much than traditional methods like [O&P], you know, there just a number of challenges in doing fecal within the clinic. You know, first and foremost is the sample prep, you know, piece, and that's very time consuming and continues to be, you know, messy, and then you can develop an algorithm that protects eggs, as you know, as part of the parasites or worms. But, you know, at the end of the day, they have to be available, that you have to be able to visually see them. The benefit in being able to detect through antigen testing is, you are able to see them in a prepaying period, which is between four and six weeks earlier than physically when the eggs are available. So, you get better detection [basis]. So, we like our solutions, we pick our customers, appreciate fecal antigen at the reference labs, and that's where we continue to support them.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Jay for final remarks.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their ongoing, extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We have an amazing purpose and opportunity as a company and I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team, and how they live our mission every day. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter result and to provide an update on our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. The operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow-through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre-COVID operating expense levels. These dynamics and a higher than expected $0.17 per share in stock based compensation tax benefit enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. Our strong start to the year has increased our comp and has been achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full-year revenue outlook range by 40 million to $3,105 million to $3,160 million, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. This reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at mid-point than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full-year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 basis point to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. We'll update or we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results in recent market trends. First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African Swine Fever testing in China, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues expanded the high growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong two-year growth trends we saw on the second half of 2020. On a two-year basis, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 70% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting two-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1; including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a two-year basis, same store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter, or approximately 1,000 basis points to 1,100 basis points adjusted for [equivalent day effects]. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected sustained strong 9% growth in non-wellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth, and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. Our continued focus on expanded pet healthcare services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same store increase in diagnostic revenues for practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. Positive market dynamics benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 22% organically in Q1, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence, and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continued to be driven by high same store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrain prior levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high growth in demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America, and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year [increase of 15%]. We also benefited from 464 second Catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVue's including strong placement levels at international markets leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our [premium earned in settlement] installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we drive in expanding our in-clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement and sales access to veterinary clinics globally, and advanced the global launch of ProCyte One. Rapid assay revenues also expanded a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing, and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid asset customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. go direct effort since 2014. Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAD business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth and new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in early regeneration instrument platform sales. Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1, compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement and non-compliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. Q1 results saw approximately 2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in [China], supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward, particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior demand for African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. Turning to the P&L, we had strong profit flow through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales, and benefits from moderate net price gains. We're planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we [lab tightly] controlled prior spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported, and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show, and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward, as we lap comparisons to control prior year OpEx levels, and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs as we work through the year in pandemic related restrictions are raised. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of 15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added 10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was 104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending, an extension of tax payments. For the full-year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0 times gross and 0.6 times net of cash, [the] 350 million in cash and no borrowings and a $1 billion revolving credit facility. We re-initiated share repurchases in Q1 allocating 154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook, we're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5%, as reported. This reflects at 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range offset by approximately $5 million and refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full-year growth benefit this year, at the rate shared in our press release. Our updated organic, overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG DX recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same store U.S. clinic clinical visit growth for the full-year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 basis to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over 50 million of operational revenue [upside] is being moderated by relatively more conservative full-year projections for IDEXX [human COVID] testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior year initiatives and plan for moderation and testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect to increase local competition in China, including \u2013 and our African swine fever testing business. Combined, these effects resulted in 0.5% headwind, compared to earlier overall 20 2021 organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 basis points to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedged positions. Our full-year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. We provided details and our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Mike, why don't I start by, just kind of, framing the comparisons that we're trying to highlight as we move forward, because that's a key dynamic? We're just trying to reinforce. Clearly we had very strong profit results in Q1. We are going to start entering a period here where we're going to be comparing ourselves to the control spending levels that we implemented last year. So, if you recall, we had 25 million of OpEx savings that we highlighted second quarter, another 5 million of savings from lower health care costs. We really, in the early stages of the pandemic tried to be very mindful of how we're controlling labor costs in areas like the labs, and so we're just trying to highlight as we move forward.  We're going to see, you know, some of those comparison effects moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, as a benchmark just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs [in T&E], which is about 7% of OpEx growth. So, moving forward, we won't have those kind of favorability. So, we're just trying to highlight that. And we're also trying to highlight that we're advancing investment in the business. So, maybe Jay can talk a bit about that. I would say, overall, Mike, the theme would be more consistency than change. What we saw in 2020 was an improvement. If you break down the drivers of things like CAG Diagnostic revenue growth in the clinic, we saw higher levels of contribution from frequency and utilization, and those have sustained. If there was one thing that improved a bit in Q1, which we highlighted in the comments was the new patient contribution to clinical visit growth was up about 100 basis points. So, I think some of the, you know, the building effect of the new puppies and kittens helped, but, you know, adjusting for that the two-year growth rates were largely consistent with Q4. It was more consistency than change. We're entering a period now where we'll have the, you know, the COVID compares, you know, because, you know, the growth rate numbers are a little tougher to follow. So, we're trying to highlight some of the two year trends. And, you know, I think we're encouraged that the two-year trends are holding up well, and you know, that's factored into our outlook for the balance of the year. One thing I'd highlight in addition to the market trends is, in terms of IDEXX's execution, our international teams are really doing an excellent job. We had excellent instrument placements, you know, growth in 360. I think the global commercial model that we've been looking to leverage and build upon is really, really in a good place. And we're very pleased with the international momentum. So, we wanted to highlight that. Yeah. On your first question on gross margin, we are seeing a really nice flow through and obviously the high CAG DX recurring mix and just the strong growth were is helping, we do anticipate, Jon, we're going to be adding back some costs here to keep up with the growth, particularly in things like lab staffing. And then we'll have, you know, some compares just to the, as I mentioned on a year-over-year basis, but we're still anticipating a high level of gross margin flow through and that's factored into our outlook. And on leverage, you're correct, we've, you know, we're quite disciplined last year in terms of pausing, share repurchases, and really controlling our capital spending. Our capital spending on an annual basis was below, kind of the normal levels that we typically have. And we deferred some projects. And we're \u2013 you will see a step up in that as we move forward, not a change fundamentally in our long-term view, but just, you know, catching up on some of the deferred capital spending. And right now, we're just signaling maintaining the kind of net leverage ratios that you see. We did initiate buybacks in Q1, and feel good about sustaining those. So \u2013 but not trying to signal any change to the leverage profile at this point. And Jon, Jon, one thing I'd highlight too, I know you're looking quarter-by-quarter, but Q3, I think you need to factor in there. There was some pent-up demand likely effects and so I think the overall trend is very healthy. It's at the higher-end of our outlook. It's above where it was pre-COVID. We feel very good about the growth and services trend as being sustainable to something that's going to, you know enhance our growth profile. Sure. [Indiscernible] started a little higher level with the global numbers, but made our \u2013 our updated range, the higher-end of the CAG DX recurring range, basically assumed similar two year growth trends to what we saw in Q4 and Q1. So, it's largely in-line with that. And I think that, that is the primary driver of the update. I think is the \u2013 just, you know, more competence coming through Q1 on sustainability of some of the trends and some positive dynamics with critical visit growth. And so that's more of the headline. We're still maintaining, you know, a range, because that may moderate. You know, we may see some pullback. We're going to be up against some compares here. But I think, on balance, we feel very good about the trends. And if anything, they improved a bit in Q1. And as a benchmark, we do try to highlight that U.S. clinical visit growth, and premium dynamic that you mentioned and our initial estimates were 2% to 5% for the full-year. For clinical visit growth, that's a one-year basis and the 900 basis point to 1,000 basis point premium.  And I did mention that our updated outlook reflects that we're trending at the higher-end on clinical visits. And that we're reinforcing the premium outlook, which is right in-line with where we were in Q1. So, you know, I think the, you know, just the underlying market trends have sustained. We feel good about that, and we are seeing that globally. And I think we feel very good about our execution. And now of course have things like ProCyte One to innovation issues that'll help us build on that momentum. So, you know, our markets are very competitive, they have always been very competitive. You know, we're pleased with what we've been able to advancing our commercial agenda. You know, we've shared some data new and competitive placements with catalysts, both in North America, as well as international. So, you can, you know, make your own assumptions in terms of what that means. Our focus is just continuing to support and serve our customers with IDEXX Solutions. We do that both on a instrument side, obviously, the broader diagnostic solutions and software. And what we find is, when customers use all of our solutions, they grow faster, they tend to stay with us longer, and they find it supports their practice needs. In terms of the survey you're mentioning, I'm not familiar with that. So, I'm just going to withhold comment not knowing the underlying methodology."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and good morning. IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through supported by 23% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we seek to develop the global market for companion animal health care, and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook, just a little over 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets. And our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX, innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I'll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to capitalize our market tailwinds and position the company to deliver continued strong financial returns. Let's begin with an update on market trends.  Companion animal healthcare continues to see strong global market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits, and continued high growth in services supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter with non-wellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%, with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to critical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kittens and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and kittens. If we do our job well with programs like preventive care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well pets and continue to expand diagnostics usage through life stages, thereby helping advanced standards of care.  In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including Bloodwork. The percentage of clinical visits with Bloodwork increased approximately 1% to 18% in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase.  Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer [indiscernible] doing more testing. With gains across wellness and non-wellness Bloodwork utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics has significant potential for further growth. In increased focus on services and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth and veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same store total practice revenues increased 15% versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice, and 21% growth in diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEXX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth and placement in new and competitive accounts. A key area focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurrent organic revenue growth internationally in Q1 with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America, despite continued restrictions and sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs and key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Kornwestheim, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. The International commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress the plan with a goal of completing on-boarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEXX and international markets reinforces the high return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next generation hematology analyzer ProCyte One. I'm was very proud of the extended team, including our Westbrook, Maine based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic, to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics that participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One's exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly at best-in-class experience. ProCyte One also represents the next step for IDEXX in providing leading edge technology integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAG growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and as part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive reference lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipment to the clinics that took advantage of our pre-sales program, while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our [sales rep] through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. The [SNAP Pro instrument] is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point of care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the SNAP Platform, a smart service connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever, so providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time, while maintaining accurate records. SNAP Pro provides a tool to address these needs and does help drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using SNAP Pro and are connected to smart service with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which help to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year. With two [indiscernible] PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Web PACS saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels over 96%. We received consistent praise from subscribers about usability, value, and support to the Web PACS system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high growth market. Through our PIMS tools, through our PIMS and tools like SmartFlow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like Web PACS, our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever with clinics managing a significant portion of visits curbside. Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of our key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care in annual wellness testing to the IDEXX preventive care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, to more predictable schedule, and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone, as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerated in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in Vector-borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand Vector-borne disease testing in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S. Shifting its balance to a full Vector-borne disease screening using 40x plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus in strong underlying market trends help to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x plus and fee-line retrovirus tests. As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation in partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top notch service levels in prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions. And we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. We anticipate more flexibility in the future, and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We're on track for strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks. And we now have time for some questions. Yeah, sure. So, just a couple things to build on Brian's comments. Obviously, we're in a high growth environment, there's excellent opportunity to continue to support that growth. We do that, obviously, in areas like reference labs and production, and field support. And the other area of opportunity for us is just our international markets. We've identified this as being very attractive and we continue to advance our expansions where it makes sense. We know that there's pretty good short-term return on those expansions. We have, I think, really optimized our ability to identify all the right pieces you need to have in place, including additional field, personnel, reference labs, information technology, investments, those type of things. So, we're very optimistic about the opportunity, short-term and long-term in our markets, U.S., as well as international and will continue to advances as we see opportunities before us. I would just add to that Mike. The trends we described, the broader level trends we've described have largely been intact. So, these are obviously new critical business growth driven by new patients. The majority of which are puppies and kittens, higher usage and intensity of diagnostics and more of a pivot to services by the veterinarians. For those that we have seen over the last, you know, second half of 2020, we continue to see in Q1. I'll make a couple comments about that, Erin. So the use of Bloodwork has \u2013 the growth rate has approximately doubled as we talked about a percent in 2020 and versus about 0.5% the previous year. And so there's a number of things that are driving that. We've seen greater proportion of the higher users of diagnostics continue to increase. And we see that very optimistically, as evidence that even those who were at the higher range from a [dead cell] standpoint of diagnostic users feel like there's a lot more capacity. We also see \u2013 as part of clinical visits, greater use of diagnostics, and then when they use them, greater intensity has also gone up. So, all those factors are playing into it. And we think that they'll sustain three plus quarters. Yeah, we're very excited and optimistic about ProCyte One. It's been a very successful roll-out. There things \u2013 there's a time and distance dimension to these, you know, as we roll-out a new analyzer in terms of building volume in production, create awareness, in the marketplace. You know, the exciting thing about ProCyte One is the opportunity itself is very significant. We think that there are 100,000 plus opportunities for placements in the hematology market, but there's also a nice multiplier impact where if there's hematology, there's chemistry. So, we tend to place those together. There's, as part of IDEXX 360 there's pull-through in terms of, you know, the reference labs and rapid essay, not just the U.S. now, but internationally. And so, we're excited by the opportunity. I think our experience, our customer experience trials have given us a lot of confidence that the analyzer has hit the mark, both in terms of usability and performance, and we expect our ramp to grow throughout the year. And especially, so internationally as we release late Q2, early Q3 pending on things like regulatory approvals. Yeah, you know, Jon, there's always a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter. We think that 900 plus, you know premium is, it's what we've seen over the last quarters in 2020 and we think that that is sustainable. I think it's a reflection of a couple of different things. Obviously, the pivot to services, which if anything has accelerated as part of the COVID response in clinics, but it's also in response that our strategy as a company around innovation, the commercial partnership with our customers in bringing testing relevant testing practices.  And so, we think that that's a successful formula. And it's supportive of what veterinarians and pet owners want to see in terms of better patient care, better \u2013 higher standards of care for patients. And that will continue to be a focus for us from a commercial and innovation strategy standpoint. Yeah, so it's early in the rollout, but we're very pleased. It's been a very successful route, very successful customer experience trials, and not easy to do, by the way, in the middle of a pandemic. This is a complex instrument, and it has a world-class user interface and performs at a very high level from just an accuracy standpoint. You know, we've identified the hematology opportunity as very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means is, if they have a choice in terms of, if it's one instrument, or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology, even before chemistry, even when they have both. So, in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it, you know, almost 100,000 placement, opportunities, two-thirds plus of which is internationally. But you know, even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry in hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So, having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, you know, hits a sweet spot. The market is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that capital placement piece is the [indiscernible], and there's pull-through on reference labs and rapid essay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitments. So, we're excited by the overall attack diagnostics opportunity that ProCyte One represents. It's going to have, you know, we think a very long tail both duration, as well as, you know, overall volume opportunity. So, more to come over time. Yeah, you know, the thing to keep, I think you're asking a question more generally about the fecal detection. And, you know, our belief is that the fecal antigen test that we offer at the reference lab is best-in-class. It detects up to two times as much than traditional methods like [O&P], you know, there just a number of challenges in doing fecal within the clinic. You know, first and foremost is the sample prep, you know, piece, and that's very time consuming and continues to be, you know, messy, and then you can develop an algorithm that protects eggs, as you know, as part of the parasites or worms. But, you know, at the end of the day, they have to be available, that you have to be able to visually see them. The benefit in being able to detect through antigen testing is, you are able to see them in a prepaying period, which is between four and six weeks earlier than physically when the eggs are available. So, you get better detection [basis]. So, we like our solutions, we pick our customers, appreciate fecal antigen at the reference labs, and that's where we continue to support them. Thank you, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their ongoing, extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We have an amazing purpose and opportunity as a company and I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team, and how they live our mission every day. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2023. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2022, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 7% organically, driven by 8% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong growth in our software and water businesses. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. Combined, these factors enabled delivery of $2.05 in EPS, up 14% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution drivers supported delivery of full year financial results at the high end of our updated guidance range. This performance is reflected in a 1,200 basis point U.S. CAG recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2022, driven by a solid volume growth premium and higher levels of price realization. We sustained record high customer retention levels and solid new business gains globally and achieved a record level of annual CAG premium instrument placements, which drove a 13% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Effective P&L management supported sustained full year comparable operating margins adjusted for discrete R&D costs aligned with our updated 2022 goals. These performance trends position us well as we enter 2023, and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting a return to 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range. This outlook is supported by continued strong IDEXX execution and net price benefits captured in our goals for double-digit CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our U.S. and international regions. We're also targeting solid comparable operating margin gains, building on the higher profit levels we achieved through the pandemic. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. We'll highlight the building blocks of our growth outlook and discuss how we're factoring in expectations for overall sector trends and potential macro impacts into our planning. We'll also review estimates for effects from FX and interest rate changes on our reported results in 2023. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 10% organic growth in water and 6% organic growth in LPD revenues. PAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 8% organically in Q4 compared to 13% prior year growth levels reflecting 9% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions. On a two- and three-year basis, Q4 results were in line with strong Q3 performance. We achieved continued double-digit organic revenue growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit, including benefits from higher price realization. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 17% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly, reflecting placement mix and comparisons to high prior year placement levels. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers, we estimate same-store diagnostics revenue in U.S. veterinary practices increased 7% in Q4. These gains continue to be supported by expansion of diagnostic test frequency and utilization. Reflected in a nearly 10% increase in diagnostics revenue per clinical visit that included diagnostics. Clinical visit levels declined 2.8% in the quarter with consistent growth trends across wellness and non-wellness categories. As we continue to work through impacts from reductions in vet clinic capacity from peak levels and lapped a significant step-up in demand we saw in 2021 and including benefits from new patient growth. IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 9% in Q4 continues to outpace sector growth trends. IDEXX' U.S. performance was supported by a 1,200 basis point growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers, including approximately 7% net price gains and continued solid growth contributions from customer additions and leverage of IDEXX innovation. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Consumable gains were supported by a 13% increase in our global premium installed base in 2022, reflecting double-digit gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 5,065 premium instruments in Q4, down modestly from high prior year levels. The quality of placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 3% global gains in new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 7% gains in the U.S. We also saw a 5% growth in new and competitive premium hematology placements globally leveraging strong customer interest in ProCyte One. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the U.S. Global Lab revenues expanded 8% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S., which were impacted to a degree by holiday week weather impacts and improved organic growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue results were supported by a relatively higher levels of net price realization, including benefits from our second half price initiatives. We estimate net price changes contributed approximately 7% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts. As we'll discuss, we've incorporated an expectation for a 7% to 8% global net price growth benefit for the full year in 2023 and building and effects from annual list price changes, which were communicated recently to our customers. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 17% organically in Q4. Results were supported by continued strong growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year 2022, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached $251 million up 15% organically and 22% as reported. This includes benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, which continues to track above our acquisition model projections. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q4 and for the full year 2022, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from net price improvement and volume gains. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 6% organically in Q4. Results benefited from growth in herd health screening, shipment timing and improved performance in China where we work through comparisons to high prior year levels for African swine fever and core wine testing. Turning to the P&L. We achieved strong operating profit and comparable operating margin gains in the fourth quarter. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, driven by gross profit gains and OpEx leverage. Gross profit increased 6% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Net price gains, higher software service gross margins, lab productivity gains and comparisons to higher prior year investment levels and business mix all contributed positively, offsetting inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses were flat as reported and up 4% on a comparable basis in the quarter. We benefited from investment prioritization and leverage from our prior commercial expansions as well as favorable comparisons to higher prior year OpEx levels related to incentive compensation accruals, the ezyVet acquisition and specific R&D investments. For the full year 2022, operating margins were 26.7%, supported by strong second half gains. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins declined 240 basis points, driven by 230 basis points of impact from discrete R&D investments. Q4 EPS was $2.05 per share, up 14% on a comparable basis. Fourth quarter EPS results reflected $0.05 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.07 in headwind from foreign exchange changes net of $9 million in Q4 hedge gains. Full year EPS was $8.03, a decline of 1% on a comparable basis, net of approximately 9% of EPS growth impact from discrete R&D investments. For the full year stock-based compensation activity provided $13 million or $0.15 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 150 basis points. Foreign exchange reduced Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 4% and 3%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.22 per share net of foreign exchange hedge gains of $26 million. Foreign exchange trends have improved significantly since our last call update, resulting in relatively lower projected financial impacts in 2023, which we've captured in our outlook. Free cash flow was $394 million for 2022 or approximately 58% of net income, net of $149 million in capital spending. This performance reflects 25% to 30% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining product availability, higher deferred R&D tax credits and investments in a major facility expansion. Free cash flow conversion came in modestly below our guidance outlook of 60% to 65%, reflecting higher than forecast year-end working capital levels, including impacts from timing. We're targeting improvement in inventory levels in 2023, which is reflected in our outlook for 80% to 90% and free cash flow conversion this year. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2022 with leverage ratios of 1.3x gross and 1.2x net of cash. Our 2023 interest expense outlook incorporates current forward interest rates and expectations for a modestly lower net leverage ratio this year. We allocated $68 million to repurchase 199,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, we allocated $811 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares. Effects from share repurchase support our projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2023. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook, we're providing initial guidance for reported revenues of $3.590 billion to $3.690 billion. On an organic basis, which reflects a range of 7% to 10% growth overall and 8.5% to 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our 10% overall organic growth high-end outlook is aligned with our long-term goals and reflects targets for 11.5% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. These targets incorporate a continued high-growth premium from IDEXX execution drivers, including growth benefits from our expanded global premium instrument installed base, new customer gains and increases in testing utilization supported by IDEXX innovation. Our high-end outlook also incorporates expectations for a relative flattening of clinical visit growth trends in the U.S. as we work through 2023. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains will be supported by an estimated 7% to 8% full year growth benefit from net price realization with expectations for 8% to 9% global net price gains in H1 and 6% to 7% net price benefit in H2. In addition to benefits from solid CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, our overall growth outlook reflects goals for continued strong growth in our veterinary software and water businesses. We expect these gains will be moderated by flat to modest organic growth at LPD revenues in 2023 and reflecting current macro trends and approximately $10 million of impact from lower human COVID testing revenues. The low end of our overall organic growth outlook of 7% incorporates potential risks to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. Terms of reported revenue, we now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% at the rates assumed in our press release. FX revenue growth headwinds are projected to be approximately 3% in Q1 with relative improvement in the second half of the year. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the FX rates assumed in our press release, we projected a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $12 million and operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million, net of currently established hedge positions. Our reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2023 is 29.0% to 29.6%. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable annual operating margin expansion, including approximately 230 basis points of benefit from lapping discrete R&D investments in 2022. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023 as benefits from pricing and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset product and labor inflationary cost impacts including effects on steps we've taken to ensure high levels of supply chain and service continuity. We estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 50 basis points driven by the lapping of the $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our 2023 EPS outlook is $9.27 per share to $9.75 per share, an increase of 16% to 21% as reported and 19% to 26% on a comparable basis, including approximately 10% of the EPS growth benefit from the lapping of discrete R&D investments. We estimate that foreign exchange will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.23 per share at the rates assumed in our press release, with the bulk of this impact in the first half. We also expect the impacts in 2023 from higher interest expense of approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2022. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1% increase in our overall effective tax rate to 22% in 2023 reflecting lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our free cash flow outlook is for net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 80% to 90%. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million or approximately 5% of revenues including approximately $35 million of spending or about 5% of free cash flow conversion impact related to the completion of our major facility expansion. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2023. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth closer to the midpoint of our full year guidance range as we continue to work through some effects from relatively higher prior year clinic capacity comparisons and macro impacts on demand in international regions. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for a 50 to 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in reported operating margins in Q1. This includes benefits from a customer contract resolution payment of $16 million received in Q1 that will be recorded as an offset to operating expense as well as expectations for foreign exchange impacts and relatively higher OpEx growth in the first quarter related to specific factors such as the return of in-person sales meetings this year. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained high levels of execution of our growth strategy. Demand for veterinary services remained strong, resulting in increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit, building on accelerated gains achieved through the pandemic. To address this strong demand, Veterinarians look to IDEXX as their preferred partner in diagnostics and software, which supported high levels of care and helped drive our solid growth results for the fourth quarter and full year. For Q4 in the full year 2022, we achieved 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues supported by double-digit contribution and growth from IDEXX execution drivers. This strong performance is reflected in record full year placements for both CAG diagnostics premium instruments and software practice information management systems, continued solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization aligned with our expectations. These execution growth drivers helped to offset impacts from adjustments in vet clinic capacity following a period of extraordinary growth during the pandemic as well as macro impacts, which globally pressured clinical visit levels in 2022. IDEXX's ability to deliver solid organic growth with underlying strong performance in operational metrics demonstrates the attractiveness and durability of our business as well as the outstanding work by teams across our organization to deliver results every day. Our decade-long strategic focus on diagnostic sector development, including building strong commercial engagement and innovating to expand adoption of technologies that integrate diagnostics and information management position us to build on this momentum. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX advanced our commercial and innovation priorities in 2022 while delivering strong financial results. I'll also discuss our areas of focus for 2023 that build on this progress. Let's start with an update on our commercial execution. High levels of execution by IDEXX commercial teams who are trusted adviser to our customers continue to drive revenue gains above sector growth levels. These teams delivered fourth quarter global premium instrument placement levels that were the second highest for any quarter in company history, supporting 13% growth in our global premium instrument installed base and contributing to record annual premium instrument placements for the full year 2022. IDEXX is highly accurate and easy to use in-clinic platforms allow clinicians to gain the deeper diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care. These platforms are highly integrated into practice workflow, giving customers the tools necessary to meet higher levels of demand for pet health care services. The strong placement performance throughout 2022 highlights how IDEXX has been able to support veterinarians during this past year, capacity constraints in a highly effective way. Not only was the magnitude of placements impressive, but they were also at very high quality. This is reflected in strong growth for Catalyst and premium hematology placements at new and competitive accounts globally. These gains demonstrate strong clinical interest in IDEXX's products and a compelling value proposition that our multimodality strategy and customer-friendly marketing programs provide to veterinarians. New and competitive placements helped drive U.S. revenue contribution from new business in the fourth quarter above historic levels, which is an encouraging signal for future growth as this new business will drive future recurring revenue flow-through supported by very high customer retention models. Customer retention rates remained at or above 97% across our major modalities throughout 2022. And another trend that highlights the strong capabilities of our commercial organization and the value that an IDEXX relationship brings to our customers. International premium placement growth was strong as well while also reflecting high-quality placements in new and competitive accounts, which supported solid net customer gains across modalities. This is a result of our global commercial teams increased leverage of our successful BDC model, which encourages a laser focus on engaging with veterinarians, educating them on the value of diagnostics in the way IDEXX can support their needs and ultimately building a loyal installed base, a key driver of our international growth opportunity. Installed base growth was supported by double-digit Catalyst placement growth in European countries where we have completed expansions since 2021. Commercial expansion is a key component of our international strategy, along with an optimized reference lab network and software tools like VetConnect PLUS. These results highlight our progress executing against that strategy. Moving forward, we look forward to building on these initiatives to address the two-thirds of our global TAM represented by international regions. The clinical and economic benefits of growing our installed base of premium instruments on CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue are notable. Let's take an example of Catalyst, our chemistry analyzer and our Catalyst SDMA slide or SDMA in combination with total T4. In 2022, customers ran and paid for over 5 million SDMA slides on a global basis and well over 40,000 clinics supported by VetConnect PLUS and IDEXX DecisionIQ. These are customers who have decided that SDMA and early biomarker for kidney impairment is a clinically important parameter in a wide variety of use cases. It's a great example of IDEXX brings not just highly differentiated innovations to our customers, but then invest in creating awareness, education, adoption and ultimately, continued utilization as part of our sector development strategy. Next, an update on our software strategy and our progress in delivering an integrated solution of information management with our reference lab and point-of-care diagnostics platforms. IDEXX software and diagnostic imaging businesses continued to deliver high placement and recurring revenue growth. This business includes an end-to-end stack of software products that create a seamless connected ecosystem across the whole tech clinic, which in turn enables deeper diagnostic insights, supports pet owner communications creates workflow efficiencies and help support greater diagnostics usage and revenue growth. Customers have never had a greater need for these solutions, as capacity constraints in some instances have limited their ability to support patient demand. This is evidenced by record PIMS placements and high-teens growth in Web PACS subscribers in 2022, which helped drive a continued shift towards recurring revenue for this business. On a full year basis, software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached over $250 million, up 15% organically. As we expand our software business, our recurring revenues are growing even faster, supporting strong gains in profit contribution and also reinforcing the value of software as a stand-alone business. PIMS placements continue to be driven by customer adoption of cloud-based solutions. As we highlighted at Investor Day this past year, the cloud is gaining momentum rapidly in the veterinary software space. We are in the midst of a significant shift towards these type of products and IDEXX's software portfolio is very well positioned to address this trend towards efficient, easy-to-use cloud-based solutions. Cloud-based PIMS comprise approximately 90% of placements in 2022, delivering a durable revenue stream and significant benefits to CAG gross margins over the -- given the SaaS-based model for these products. We are on track for cloud-based PIMS to represent over 50% of our global footprint this year and expect this shift to accelerate over the rest of this decade. These results were achieved while our software team was tasked with delivering the rapid integration of the ezyVet solution into our business, a multiyear priority that is tracking well and driving revenue and profit delivery ahead of the expectations established during the acquisition process. This progress is a great example of how IDEXX consistently delivers high levels of return on invested capital by deploying resources in the right place at the right time and delivering seamless execution and integration. This not only benefits our financial performance but also drives the sector forward and puts world-class products and enhance of our customers. Our software business will continue to provide attractive, highly synergistic investment opportunities. The early success of our cloud-first strategy, anchored by ezyVet positions IDEXX well over the coming years as software and cloud data products increased in relevance and importance to veterinary clinics. In addition to this excellent software performance, strong commercial results were also supported by IDEXX's relentless focus on innovation as a key driver of diagnostics adoption and utilization. 2022 is an exciting year of innovation for IDEXX in multiple ways, starting with continued strong adoption of our ProCyte One premium hematology analyzer, which launched in 2021. The ProCyte One offers customers very high clinical performance in an efficient, lower cost and smaller footprint platform. It is critical to our efforts to address the approximately 240,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity given its relevance submitting hematology first international countries and its high attach rates catalyst. Worldwide placements grew 16% for ProCyte One in the fourth quarter, elevating the installed base of this new piece of technology to more than 8,000 units. This is very strong progress against our target for 20,000 incremental premium hematology placements by 2026, and we look forward to building on this momentum to achieve our long-term goals. In terms of more recent innovation launches, we were excited to announce multiple expansions to our preventive care solutions recently at VMX. These program extensions will provide veterinarians with deeper insights and allow them to detect issues sooner and include the launch of IDEXX Nu.Q Canine Cancer Screen now available at our U.S. Reference hub network, which expands our growing oncology platform by adding a more accessible way for veterinarians to screen for a disease that impacts nearly 6 million dogs annually in the U.S. And secondly, the rollout of IDEXX Preventive Care Simple Start, formerly preventive care challenge, an improved wellness program designed for the capacity-constrained practice, which includes staff training and tools for custom diagnostic profile development and client communications. At VMX, we also shared an expansion to the menu for IDEXX DecisionIQ, formerly clinical decision support which now includes endocrine features in addition to the vector-borne disease and chronic kidney disease conditions we rolled out earlier in 2022. This software service applies intelligent insights, to patient-specific data and delivers next step considerations in VetConnect PLUs. Valuable insights would support veterinarians to swiftly and confidently move through a case. Innovation does not stop at the point of launching a new product. However, integrating new technology into practice workflows and protocols and supporting customers with our medical consulting group is an important step in driving adoption and utilization of our diagnostic solutions. We have recently seen good traction in this area with some of our products and services, which were launched in 2022. Our approved 4Dx Plus in fecal, DX antigen test with detection of flea tapeworms are now included with the Preventive Care Simple Start program we announced at VMX. Another example is FGF23. And a biomarker that helps determine dietary phosphate restriction in cats with kidney disease that is offered through our reference labs has now been integrated into updated International Renal Interest Society Guidelines. These product rollouts are critical to our long-term efforts to develop the companion animal diagnostics and information management sector. They help drive the consistent positive contribution to sector diagnostics revenue growth for both diagnostics frequency and utilization that we saw in 2022 and continued adoption of new technologies to help build off these higher levels in 2023. The relentless focus on innovation demonstrates IDEXX's commitment to developing our sector and highlights our customer-first approach, which aims to address the most pressing needs of veterinarians. In this context, diagnostics has become an integral way for veterinarians to enable the provision of medical services and to grow their practices, reflecting same-store clinical diagnostics revenue growth of 7% that is outpacing total practice and clinical revenue gains and becoming a larger contribution to practice profitability. Our customers are hungry for solutions that help them deliver a higher standard of care and help support workflow, client communications and staff productivity. An additional key element necessary to provide this enablement is product and service continuity and turnaround time. For these reasons, it is of great importance that IDEXX gives our customers confidence and reinsurance that the products and services they need, will be available when and where they need them. Our supply chain teams ensured this continuity by delivering 99% product availability and on-time delivery levels again in the fourth quarter. A standard we achieved in each quarter of 2022. This performance gives us a pride to confidently say that if and when our customers ever need our help, where they help them. And in turn, our customers reward us with high retention levels and world-class NPS scores for our products and services. This customer-first mindset is fundamental to our strategy and we look forward to bringing it to our work on a daily basis in 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we transition to Q&A, I would like to recognize our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing passion and high levels of performance, which supported solid growth in 2022 in a very dynamic external environment. Their work helps us work towards providing a better future for animals, people, our planet today, while also addressing the significant sector development opportunity ahead of us. It's an honor to report the results of this excellent execution against our strategic priorities, and it's exciting to share how IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So on behalf of the management team, I'll say thank you to our colleagues for the enthusiasm and engagement you bring to our work every day. You are at the core of our progress we've made against our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. With that, we'll now open the line for Q&A\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time I'll take your first question from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: I guess, starting with the U.S., how are you thinking about the cadence of U.S. clinical visit growth this year? It sounds like 1Q will be similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter. And then Brian, I think you said the high end of guidance reflects a flattening of visits for the year. So could you maybe just talk about your expectation for how the year plays out? And do you envision a return to positive clinical visit growth by the back half of the year in the high end of your guidance?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question, Nate. We are expecting that we'll still be working through some of the compares in the U.S. to the pullback in capacity that kind of happened through the first half of last year. And so you're correct. I think that's something we're acknowledging in the Q1 outlook. We'll still be working through that as well as some of the macro impacts internationally. We -- the guidance that we provided, as you pointed out, the higher end does for the U.S. assume that we see a flattening of the trend and that's meant to imply in the back half of the year. And so that would assume a relative level of improvement, but is not projecting growth. I think Jay can talk a bit more to that, but I think that that's an appropriate assumption we feel with the changes that we've been working through.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Nate. Yes. I would just qualitatively add that what we see from a market standpoint and customer standpoint, is the -- they made good progress in working through some of the capacity constraints they're not all working at the same pace. We've seen a bolus of practices who have adjusted care workflows, added staff particularly licensed veterinarians per overall veterinarian. So, the mix is more towards staff, and they've been able to increase productivity in that sense. So, I think just as we forecasted, it's taken time but I think the profession is making the progress. They're investing in technology. We've seen that with the purchase and inflation of our in-clinic laboratory software solutions particularly cloud-based software solutions is something that veterinarians are looking to as a way of supporting staff productivity, client communications, just overall workflow optimization within the practice.\nNathan Rich: Okay, great. And maybe just to follow up on that. Obviously, you've talked about a higher level of net price realization expected for 2023. Could you maybe just talk about what the reactions from customers have been to the price increases that you took in 2022? And does the outlook kind of assume any impact on the level of utilization or volumes that you expect? And could you maybe also just comment on is the price realization kind of brought across the different product lines in CAG?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So let me take the back end of your question first. It is. So this is a global approach that we've taken, and we think pricing is appropriate within the current context. I'll say from a qualitative standpoint, we see demand holding up well relative to both the back impacts in the economy as well as the different pricing scenarios we've articulated. Keep in mind that from a customer standpoint, they're highly appreciative and they value the overall IDEXX value proposition, goods and services and they recognize that on a sustained basis, we've invested and we'll continue to invest in innovation, but also the customer experience, which is critically important to them so that they can focus on providing care and don't have to worry about diagnostic service levels and just overall product continuity. The other thing that I would say is they also recognize that we have taken a technology for life type approach. If you take a look at our catalyst, our chemistry analyzer over the last decade, there have been nine parameter extensions or upgrades so that a customer who purchased. Our catalysts, chemistry analyzer today or 10 years ago would have the exact same features and functionality. And we think that's highly differentiated, not just in our industry, but really in the industry.\nBrian McKeon: Just reinforce to that our goals at the higher end, which is what we're shooting for as a company, we reflect sustaining the solid volume growth premium that we've been able to achieve. So, independent of the pricing benefit, how much we've been able to drive volume growth above clinical visit growth, and it reflects sustaining that strong level of performance.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just following up on the pricing one. Can you just talk at least directionally about longer-term pricing dynamics, not looking for specific numbers? But should we think about more normalized price increases as we look out to 2024 and beyond, and this is kind of like a unique window with what's happening with inflation and everything else? Or is this a -- it could be ongoing kind of trend with larger price increases? And then just a follow-up after that.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Chris, we're not projecting beyond this year, so this is guidance for 2023. We recognize just as a pricing philosophy. We want to maintain a good balance between the value we deliver, the price of our testing services. Keep in mind also that veterinary practices that the diagnostics is a core neighbor medical services within the practice. It's a large profit center for them. They typically mark it up. But having said that, we want to make sure we don't get in front of where the value is. And we're taking a very long-term approach to developing the overall sector. So and you've seen that historically. And the way we've reported it, I think the difference in 2022 and 2023 as inflation and the macroeconomic cost impacts of running the business.\nChris Schott: Great and then just -- can you just elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for Europe? I guess how much of a macro headwind that you're seeing in these markets? And maybe just talk a little bit about how you see those headwinds playing out as we move through 2023?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. So, our goal is -- we came out of the second half of the year with about 6% CAG diagnostic recurring growth. Our goal is at the higher end for next year or 10%. And so, that's obviously an improvement. This year it's tougher to calibrate. We don't have the same clinic level data granularity, but I think the same-store sales headwinds in places like Europe are probably in the mid-single-digit range. So, it's softer than the U.S. and so consistent with what we're doing in our U.S. business, we're targeting sustained execution driver leverage. So, getting -- growing faster than the same store sales at the clinic visit growth levels, and we are building in some expectation for less of a headwind but still some headwinds. And I think that's appropriate just given the macro backdrop that our international markets are still working through, but we are targeting double-digit growth. We've got the pricing benefits that Jay highlighted to help support that and still feel very optimistic about the long-term potential in our international regions.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Let me pick up on that of the long-term potential. We see two-thirds of the future TAM outside our U.S. geography. And so that's something that we've invested in. Over time, we've had seven expansions, commercial expansions over the last few years. Currently, there's some macro headwinds as Brian described them, but I think the opportunity is very significant over time and we're approaching it in a similar way that we've approached our sector development in the U.S., which is through innovation, through engagement with our commercial model as partners and really helping create awareness and education and ultimately, adoption. So, we're very optimistic over the longer term. We think also, I would just highlight the role that ProCyte One has played in our international geography. It's a very compelling solution. Our customers, it fits from a performance profile, cost standpoint. Many of these markets are hematology first markets, and we're seeing very nice uptake, and we expect, as we've laid out at Investor Day, that 20,000 premium hematology placements over the planning horizon.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Does your guidance for 2023 assume any sort of contribution from the two new platforms that you plan to launch here, hopefully, in the near future? And how should we think about those? Are they more of a 2024 event? And how should we also just be thinking about the timing of magnitude in terms of the contribution from the innovation pipeline?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. No, we haven't provided any specifics on the two new point-of-care platforms. And as we get closer to launch, we'll talk about this.\nBrian McKeon: Yes. They're not in the there's nothing related to those platforms in the guidance.\nErin Wright: Okay. So -- and then.\nBrian McKeon: Other than the cost to support continuing.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And on the cost side, I guess, 7% to 8% price realization obviously tracking above historical. And I think Brian, you talked about some of this in your prepared remarks, but what are some of those key factors that we should be kind of aware of that are limiting the full drop through from a pricing perspective to the bottom line?\nBrian McKeon: The inflationary costs are real. On the product cost front, took a number of steps this year to ensure that we have high product availability and it's been a challenging kind of environment to manage the supply chain dynamics. Our operational team has done a fantastic job on that front, but we did make choices to ensure we've got supply, and that's going to be flowing through in our product costs for a period of time, and there are higher labor costs as well. I think we're the price increases that we advanced, I think reflected in our margin outlook where appropriate, given some of the dynamics that we're working through. And we're able to improve gross margins through initiatives like productivity activity and our initiatives in our lab operations and just continued focus on growing our recurring revenues at a strong rate. But the -- on the gross margin front, that's the primary impact. And I think we're always trying to be balanced with our base of overall investment and that's allowing us to deliver solid margin improvement overall at the higher end of our guidance range.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I would also add, just on the commercial front, we're back to more of a normal type operational cadence. We attended the VMX and VMX was the biggest show in its history. We've had sales summits from a customer visit standpoint, our field organization is -- the majority of visits are now in person. So it's much more of a pre- pandemic type operational cadence.\nOperator: Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Brian, I think in your earlier comments, you talked a little bit about the IDEXX premium, the bridge between the underlying vet visit volume and price and then your actual revenue growth. I think you said that the high end of the guide assumes a similar premium to what you've seen previously. Is there a lower premium at the lower end of the guide? Can you talk us through sort of what your expectations are for that between the 7% and the 10%, sort of what are you thinking in terms of the IDEXX growth premium?\nBrian McKeon: Right. Thanks for the question, Mike. So, just starting with the high end, let me use the U.S. So if we've got an 11.5% growth goal with 7% to 8% pricing, that's approximately implied about 4% volume growth and with some level of headwind from visits as we work through the first half of the year. That gets us to go to the volume growth premium that we've been delivering and kind of consistent with pre-pandemic trends. So that's how we're thinking about it. We have a range which we think is appropriate to calibrate for risks to that outlook, primarily macroeconomic impacts and, you know, so I think that's not linked to one specific factor, but I think it's something that we think is prudent, is the way we plan the business to make sure that we have financial plans where we can deliver solid profit gains, if things don't all go the way that we anticipate. And so again, it's not linked to one specific factor, but it builds in potential macro headwinds or if things don't recover the way that we're targeting in terms of the clinical visit trends.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And then for the follow-up, we're seeing last year in 2022 and this year, some very specific product launches coming from HESKA and ABAXIS and others in the space. So, I'm wondering if you could touch on the competitive landscape just a little bit kind of tied into that previous question as well. Any changes you're seeing there? Any come conversations with customers, how that might factor into your pricing strategy?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. We've said for a long time, the diagnostics market is a very attractive market. There's a lot of competitive intensity. Nothing has changed on that front. We believe that through the customer lens that our overall solution portfolio is highly differentiated the combination of our in-clinic laboratory reference laboratory software, the connectivity of it all really helped support the practice mission. We see that if you take a look at our new and competitive placements, which we provided both for Catalyst and now for premium hematology, we're doing extremely well. We're growing our software in Web PACS and Diagnostic Imaging businesses very well. We feel very good about our focus on the customers and helping them to achieve their goals and we think it's reflected in the results.\nOperator: Mr. Block you have anything further or Mr. Ryskin, my apologies.\nMichael Ryskin: No, that's it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Jon Block with Stifel.\nJon Block: Great. First one, Brian, maybe just a clarification. I thought you said a $16 million customer contract resolution. Was that in the first quarter of '23? I'm not sure I heard you properly. And if so, is that in the GAAP 2023 EPS guide, I'm landing at $0.15-ish to the bottom line. Maybe you can comment on that. And then last, just bolt-on. Is that an offset to OpEx, if I'm right on all these assumptions, not a rev line item, and I'll start with that clarification, please?\nBrian McKeon: I think you had got all that right. It is a Q1 2023 factor that we highlighted in our Q1 outlook and it is recorded as an -- it's an other income item for us which is recorded as an offset to G&A, and that's correct.\nJon Block: I got it all right. I don't know if I should push it. But the 9% to 16% comparable earnings growth that you sort of have in the release once you back out the 10%, is it in that one as well? The 9% to 16% also benefits from the $0.15?\nBrian McKeon: Perfect. And then just maybe to follow on Mike's question, I'm just sort of coming at it a little differently. For2023 clinical visits, it sounds like you're landing around down 1% to 2% for the full year, I don't know, around there. So vals are down, 1% to 2%, and price is up 7% to 8%, and just to be clear on price -- it's 7% to 8%, right. The press release read a little funny saying like 7% to 8% was the case if you were at the high end of your range. I'm guessing prices price, maybe you guys can clarify that.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. That is correct.\nJon Block: Okay. So price is right. So yes, there was a confusion incoming on that. So if vals are down 1% to 2% and price is up 7% to 8% if I take your 10% CAG Dx recurring you land at what we're calling 400 to 500 bps of non-price non-visit growth, which seems like an ongoing deceleration throughout sort of '22, certainly the back half of '22. And I know there's moving parts with U.S. and international, Brian, but sometimes we don't get such great granularity too. Just your thoughts on that 400 to 500 bps non-priced on visit growth the deceleration comments, and broadly speaking, is that sort of how we should view the business in the near term until maybe innovation kicks back in?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, John. I was trying to follow your analytics. We focus those discussions on our U.S. numbers, just to be clear because that's where we actually have the reporting. So, the 11.5% overall growth if you use the midpoint of the pricing guide. And I do want to clarify the expected pricing benefit is something that we feel very good about across our performance range. So that is -- we were focusing on kind of the analytics around our high end to help people understand that. But going back to the high end of 11.5% CAG U.S. recurring diagnostic revenue growth, netting out the price benefit, use the midpoint that would be about 4% volume benefit. And we didn't explicitly highlight the clinical visit trend, but it bridges back to that that 5% to 6% kind of volume growth premium that we saw in the second half. That's about what we've seen pre-pandemic. And so, we're looking -- that's what we're shooting for. And all indications our execution is holding up really well. If you look at the performance of trips and just how we've consistently done, so looking to build on that momentum.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I would just add to that, if you take a look at the execution metrics around customer retention, new customer acquisition, Brian highlighted price realization, which we think is appropriate given the current context. Overall, commercial execution has been excellent, and we anticipate being able to continue to execute well in the current year.\nOperator: Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Jay, maybe a big picture one for you. I'm curious if you look back over the last year or so with the capacity constraints your practice clients are facing. Have you noticed any material changes and maybe either based on your data or conversations with your customer-facing team, in regards to how they're using diagnostics. So changing the point of care to reference lab versus on-site or maybe running larger panels, so they don't have to do reruns, just anything like that from a macro trend basis that you're seeing?\nJay Mazelsky: Ryan. So, we have not -- we continue to see that customers would use one modality and diagnostics tend to use more of the other modality and vice versa. It's testing begets testing. We've seen a continuation of that trend. We've also seen wellness versus non-wellness testing hold up well. We think that that's really a function of pet owner demand. Pet owners want to be able to get the great care, whether for health, happiness, even longevity of their pet. So, they're filling into the practices and for wellness and preventive care visits. So, we continue to see that as an important aspect of developing the overall sector. We do see practices I think, to a greater extent than in previous times. I appreciate the role of their staff, retaining their staff, investing in education of their staff. I think they've gotten smarter around the use of technology in the importance of technology. We've seen that in software and the move to cloud-based PIM systems, but also the applications that that integrate and extend the capability of their PIM systems. So, we think that overall, even given the overall macro impacts that we've described, pet owner and consumer demand has held up relatively well.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And then maybe digging a little bit deeper into some of the clinical decision support, you spent more time, I think, than in the past talking about the cloud and kind of data analytics and using that data. So, can you dive a little bit more into DecisionIQ and how broad that goes in regards to informing point-of-care clinical decisions and how widely used that is from the practitioners that are using it to do next step diagnostics?\nJay Mazelsky: I'd be glad to. Yes, DecisionIQ is what formerly known as clinical decision support as part of our VetConnect PLUS application. Keep in mind, just let me paint the broader context here is that the general practitioner is incredibly busy. They're responsible for this wide range of clinical and medical services and having DecisionIQ, which can support the decision-making, which can suggest the possible things that they may not have considered. And even I think to your question or point, suggest next step test, we think, is an important tool in the hands of veterinarians. We have tens of thousands of practices on a global basis, which are now using VetConnect PLUS and therefore DecisionIQ as part of their daily practice, the ability to support vector-borne disease and now endocrine is that menu will continue to be extended over time. So, it's becoming increasingly valuable in the hands of veterinarians and something that we think over time will just grow in value. But thank you for that question. That's a wrap. We're out of time. I'd like to thank everyone, and that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I appreciate your participation this morning. So in summary, we see a significant decade-long opportunity to increase the standard of care for companion animal health care and remain committed to our consistent strategic approach to address this opportunity. Sustain high levels of performance by IDEXX teams enabled us to build on the decades-long investments in innovation, infrastructure and commercial capabilities to deliver solid growth and strong financial returns in 2022 and positions us well for 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2023. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2022, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 7% organically, driven by 8% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong growth in our software and water businesses. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. Combined, these factors enabled delivery of $2.05 in EPS, up 14% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution drivers supported delivery of full year financial results at the high end of our updated guidance range. This performance is reflected in a 1,200 basis point U.S. CAG recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2022, driven by a solid volume growth premium and higher levels of price realization. We sustained record high customer retention levels and solid new business gains globally and achieved a record level of annual CAG premium instrument placements, which drove a 13% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Effective P&L management supported sustained full year comparable operating margins adjusted for discrete R&D costs aligned with our updated 2022 goals. These performance trends position us well as we enter 2023, and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting a return to 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range. This outlook is supported by continued strong IDEXX execution and net price benefits captured in our goals for double-digit CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our U.S. and international regions. We're also targeting solid comparable operating margin gains, building on the higher profit levels we achieved through the pandemic. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. We'll highlight the building blocks of our growth outlook and discuss how we're factoring in expectations for overall sector trends and potential macro impacts into our planning. We'll also review estimates for effects from FX and interest rate changes on our reported results in 2023. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 10% organic growth in water and 6% organic growth in LPD revenues. PAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 8% organically in Q4 compared to 13% prior year growth levels reflecting 9% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions. On a two- and three-year basis, Q4 results were in line with strong Q3 performance. We achieved continued double-digit organic revenue growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit, including benefits from higher price realization. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 17% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly, reflecting placement mix and comparisons to high prior year placement levels. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers, we estimate same-store diagnostics revenue in U.S. veterinary practices increased 7% in Q4. These gains continue to be supported by expansion of diagnostic test frequency and utilization. Reflected in a nearly 10% increase in diagnostics revenue per clinical visit that included diagnostics. Clinical visit levels declined 2.8% in the quarter with consistent growth trends across wellness and non-wellness categories. As we continue to work through impacts from reductions in vet clinic capacity from peak levels and lapped a significant step-up in demand we saw in 2021 and including benefits from new patient growth. IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 9% in Q4 continues to outpace sector growth trends. IDEXX' U.S. performance was supported by a 1,200 basis point growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers, including approximately 7% net price gains and continued solid growth contributions from customer additions and leverage of IDEXX innovation. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Consumable gains were supported by a 13% increase in our global premium installed base in 2022, reflecting double-digit gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 5,065 premium instruments in Q4, down modestly from high prior year levels. The quality of placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 3% global gains in new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 7% gains in the U.S. We also saw a 5% growth in new and competitive premium hematology placements globally leveraging strong customer interest in ProCyte One. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the U.S. Global Lab revenues expanded 8% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S., which were impacted to a degree by holiday week weather impacts and improved organic growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue results were supported by a relatively higher levels of net price realization, including benefits from our second half price initiatives. We estimate net price changes contributed approximately 7% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts. As we'll discuss, we've incorporated an expectation for a 7% to 8% global net price growth benefit for the full year in 2023 and building and effects from annual list price changes, which were communicated recently to our customers. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 17% organically in Q4. Results were supported by continued strong growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year 2022, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached $251 million up 15% organically and 22% as reported. This includes benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, which continues to track above our acquisition model projections. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q4 and for the full year 2022, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from net price improvement and volume gains. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 6% organically in Q4. Results benefited from growth in herd health screening, shipment timing and improved performance in China where we work through comparisons to high prior year levels for African swine fever and core wine testing. Turning to the P&L. We achieved strong operating profit and comparable operating margin gains in the fourth quarter. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, driven by gross profit gains and OpEx leverage. Gross profit increased 6% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Net price gains, higher software service gross margins, lab productivity gains and comparisons to higher prior year investment levels and business mix all contributed positively, offsetting inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses were flat as reported and up 4% on a comparable basis in the quarter. We benefited from investment prioritization and leverage from our prior commercial expansions as well as favorable comparisons to higher prior year OpEx levels related to incentive compensation accruals, the ezyVet acquisition and specific R&D investments. For the full year 2022, operating margins were 26.7%, supported by strong second half gains. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins declined 240 basis points, driven by 230 basis points of impact from discrete R&D investments. Q4 EPS was $2.05 per share, up 14% on a comparable basis. Fourth quarter EPS results reflected $0.05 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.07 in headwind from foreign exchange changes net of $9 million in Q4 hedge gains. Full year EPS was $8.03, a decline of 1% on a comparable basis, net of approximately 9% of EPS growth impact from discrete R&D investments. For the full year stock-based compensation activity provided $13 million or $0.15 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 150 basis points. Foreign exchange reduced Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 4% and 3%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.22 per share net of foreign exchange hedge gains of $26 million. Foreign exchange trends have improved significantly since our last call update, resulting in relatively lower projected financial impacts in 2023, which we've captured in our outlook. Free cash flow was $394 million for 2022 or approximately 58% of net income, net of $149 million in capital spending. This performance reflects 25% to 30% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining product availability, higher deferred R&D tax credits and investments in a major facility expansion. Free cash flow conversion came in modestly below our guidance outlook of 60% to 65%, reflecting higher than forecast year-end working capital levels, including impacts from timing. We're targeting improvement in inventory levels in 2023, which is reflected in our outlook for 80% to 90% and free cash flow conversion this year. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2022 with leverage ratios of 1.3x gross and 1.2x net of cash. Our 2023 interest expense outlook incorporates current forward interest rates and expectations for a modestly lower net leverage ratio this year. We allocated $68 million to repurchase 199,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, we allocated $811 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares. Effects from share repurchase support our projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2023. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook, we're providing initial guidance for reported revenues of $3.590 billion to $3.690 billion. On an organic basis, which reflects a range of 7% to 10% growth overall and 8.5% to 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our 10% overall organic growth high-end outlook is aligned with our long-term goals and reflects targets for 11.5% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. These targets incorporate a continued high-growth premium from IDEXX execution drivers, including growth benefits from our expanded global premium instrument installed base, new customer gains and increases in testing utilization supported by IDEXX innovation. Our high-end outlook also incorporates expectations for a relative flattening of clinical visit growth trends in the U.S. as we work through 2023. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains will be supported by an estimated 7% to 8% full year growth benefit from net price realization with expectations for 8% to 9% global net price gains in H1 and 6% to 7% net price benefit in H2. In addition to benefits from solid CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, our overall growth outlook reflects goals for continued strong growth in our veterinary software and water businesses. We expect these gains will be moderated by flat to modest organic growth at LPD revenues in 2023 and reflecting current macro trends and approximately $10 million of impact from lower human COVID testing revenues. The low end of our overall organic growth outlook of 7% incorporates potential risks to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. Terms of reported revenue, we now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% at the rates assumed in our press release. FX revenue growth headwinds are projected to be approximately 3% in Q1 with relative improvement in the second half of the year. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the FX rates assumed in our press release, we projected a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $12 million and operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million, net of currently established hedge positions. Our reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2023 is 29.0% to 29.6%. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable annual operating margin expansion, including approximately 230 basis points of benefit from lapping discrete R&D investments in 2022. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023 as benefits from pricing and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset product and labor inflationary cost impacts including effects on steps we've taken to ensure high levels of supply chain and service continuity. We estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 50 basis points driven by the lapping of the $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our 2023 EPS outlook is $9.27 per share to $9.75 per share, an increase of 16% to 21% as reported and 19% to 26% on a comparable basis, including approximately 10% of the EPS growth benefit from the lapping of discrete R&D investments. We estimate that foreign exchange will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.23 per share at the rates assumed in our press release, with the bulk of this impact in the first half. We also expect the impacts in 2023 from higher interest expense of approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2022. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1% increase in our overall effective tax rate to 22% in 2023 reflecting lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our free cash flow outlook is for net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 80% to 90%. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million or approximately 5% of revenues including approximately $35 million of spending or about 5% of free cash flow conversion impact related to the completion of our major facility expansion. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2023. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth closer to the midpoint of our full year guidance range as we continue to work through some effects from relatively higher prior year clinic capacity comparisons and macro impacts on demand in international regions. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for a 50 to 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in reported operating margins in Q1. This includes benefits from a customer contract resolution payment of $16 million received in Q1 that will be recorded as an offset to operating expense as well as expectations for foreign exchange impacts and relatively higher OpEx growth in the first quarter related to specific factors such as the return of in-person sales meetings this year. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your question, Nate. We are expecting that we'll still be working through some of the compares in the U.S. to the pullback in capacity that kind of happened through the first half of last year. And so you're correct. I think that's something we're acknowledging in the Q1 outlook. We'll still be working through that as well as some of the macro impacts internationally. We -- the guidance that we provided, as you pointed out, the higher end does for the U.S. assume that we see a flattening of the trend and that's meant to imply in the back half of the year. And so that would assume a relative level of improvement, but is not projecting growth. I think Jay can talk a bit more to that, but I think that that's an appropriate assumption we feel with the changes that we've been working through. Just reinforce to that our goals at the higher end, which is what we're shooting for as a company, we reflect sustaining the solid volume growth premium that we've been able to achieve. So, independent of the pricing benefit, how much we've been able to drive volume growth above clinical visit growth, and it reflects sustaining that strong level of performance. Yes. So, our goal is -- we came out of the second half of the year with about 6% CAG diagnostic recurring growth. Our goal is at the higher end for next year or 10%. And so, that's obviously an improvement. This year it's tougher to calibrate. We don't have the same clinic level data granularity, but I think the same-store sales headwinds in places like Europe are probably in the mid-single-digit range. So, it's softer than the U.S. and so consistent with what we're doing in our U.S. business, we're targeting sustained execution driver leverage. So, getting -- growing faster than the same store sales at the clinic visit growth levels, and we are building in some expectation for less of a headwind but still some headwinds. And I think that's appropriate just given the macro backdrop that our international markets are still working through, but we are targeting double-digit growth. We've got the pricing benefits that Jay highlighted to help support that and still feel very optimistic about the long-term potential in our international regions. Yes. They're not in the there's nothing related to those platforms in the guidance. Other than the cost to support continuing. The inflationary costs are real. On the product cost front, took a number of steps this year to ensure that we have high product availability and it's been a challenging kind of environment to manage the supply chain dynamics. Our operational team has done a fantastic job on that front, but we did make choices to ensure we've got supply, and that's going to be flowing through in our product costs for a period of time, and there are higher labor costs as well. I think we're the price increases that we advanced, I think reflected in our margin outlook where appropriate, given some of the dynamics that we're working through. And we're able to improve gross margins through initiatives like productivity activity and our initiatives in our lab operations and just continued focus on growing our recurring revenues at a strong rate. But the -- on the gross margin front, that's the primary impact. And I think we're always trying to be balanced with our base of overall investment and that's allowing us to deliver solid margin improvement overall at the higher end of our guidance range. Right. Thanks for the question, Mike. So, just starting with the high end, let me use the U.S. So if we've got an 11.5% growth goal with 7% to 8% pricing, that's approximately implied about 4% volume growth and with some level of headwind from visits as we work through the first half of the year. That gets us to go to the volume growth premium that we've been delivering and kind of consistent with pre-pandemic trends. So that's how we're thinking about it. We have a range which we think is appropriate to calibrate for risks to that outlook, primarily macroeconomic impacts and, you know, so I think that's not linked to one specific factor, but I think it's something that we think is prudent, is the way we plan the business to make sure that we have financial plans where we can deliver solid profit gains, if things don't all go the way that we anticipate. And so again, it's not linked to one specific factor, but it builds in potential macro headwinds or if things don't recover the way that we're targeting in terms of the clinical visit trends. I think you had got all that right. It is a Q1 2023 factor that we highlighted in our Q1 outlook and it is recorded as an -- it's an other income item for us which is recorded as an offset to G&A, and that's correct. Perfect. And then just maybe to follow on Mike's question, I'm just sort of coming at it a little differently. For2023 clinical visits, it sounds like you're landing around down 1% to 2% for the full year, I don't know, around there. So vals are down, 1% to 2%, and price is up 7% to 8%, and just to be clear on price -- it's 7% to 8%, right. The press release read a little funny saying like 7% to 8% was the case if you were at the high end of your range. I'm guessing prices price, maybe you guys can clarify that. Thanks, John. I was trying to follow your analytics. We focus those discussions on our U.S. numbers, just to be clear because that's where we actually have the reporting. So, the 11.5% overall growth if you use the midpoint of the pricing guide. And I do want to clarify the expected pricing benefit is something that we feel very good about across our performance range. So that is -- we were focusing on kind of the analytics around our high end to help people understand that. But going back to the high end of 11.5% CAG U.S. recurring diagnostic revenue growth, netting out the price benefit, use the midpoint that would be about 4% volume benefit. And we didn't explicitly highlight the clinical visit trend, but it bridges back to that that 5% to 6% kind of volume growth premium that we saw in the second half. That's about what we've seen pre-pandemic. And so, we're looking -- that's what we're shooting for. And all indications our execution is holding up really well. If you look at the performance of trips and just how we've consistently done, so looking to build on that momentum."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained high levels of execution of our growth strategy. Demand for veterinary services remained strong, resulting in increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit, building on accelerated gains achieved through the pandemic. To address this strong demand, Veterinarians look to IDEXX as their preferred partner in diagnostics and software, which supported high levels of care and helped drive our solid growth results for the fourth quarter and full year. For Q4 in the full year 2022, we achieved 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues supported by double-digit contribution and growth from IDEXX execution drivers. This strong performance is reflected in record full year placements for both CAG diagnostics premium instruments and software practice information management systems, continued solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization aligned with our expectations. These execution growth drivers helped to offset impacts from adjustments in vet clinic capacity following a period of extraordinary growth during the pandemic as well as macro impacts, which globally pressured clinical visit levels in 2022. IDEXX's ability to deliver solid organic growth with underlying strong performance in operational metrics demonstrates the attractiveness and durability of our business as well as the outstanding work by teams across our organization to deliver results every day. Our decade-long strategic focus on diagnostic sector development, including building strong commercial engagement and innovating to expand adoption of technologies that integrate diagnostics and information management position us to build on this momentum. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX advanced our commercial and innovation priorities in 2022 while delivering strong financial results. I'll also discuss our areas of focus for 2023 that build on this progress. Let's start with an update on our commercial execution. High levels of execution by IDEXX commercial teams who are trusted adviser to our customers continue to drive revenue gains above sector growth levels. These teams delivered fourth quarter global premium instrument placement levels that were the second highest for any quarter in company history, supporting 13% growth in our global premium instrument installed base and contributing to record annual premium instrument placements for the full year 2022. IDEXX is highly accurate and easy to use in-clinic platforms allow clinicians to gain the deeper diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care. These platforms are highly integrated into practice workflow, giving customers the tools necessary to meet higher levels of demand for pet health care services. The strong placement performance throughout 2022 highlights how IDEXX has been able to support veterinarians during this past year, capacity constraints in a highly effective way. Not only was the magnitude of placements impressive, but they were also at very high quality. This is reflected in strong growth for Catalyst and premium hematology placements at new and competitive accounts globally. These gains demonstrate strong clinical interest in IDEXX's products and a compelling value proposition that our multimodality strategy and customer-friendly marketing programs provide to veterinarians. New and competitive placements helped drive U.S. revenue contribution from new business in the fourth quarter above historic levels, which is an encouraging signal for future growth as this new business will drive future recurring revenue flow-through supported by very high customer retention models. Customer retention rates remained at or above 97% across our major modalities throughout 2022. And another trend that highlights the strong capabilities of our commercial organization and the value that an IDEXX relationship brings to our customers. International premium placement growth was strong as well while also reflecting high-quality placements in new and competitive accounts, which supported solid net customer gains across modalities. This is a result of our global commercial teams increased leverage of our successful BDC model, which encourages a laser focus on engaging with veterinarians, educating them on the value of diagnostics in the way IDEXX can support their needs and ultimately building a loyal installed base, a key driver of our international growth opportunity. Installed base growth was supported by double-digit Catalyst placement growth in European countries where we have completed expansions since 2021. Commercial expansion is a key component of our international strategy, along with an optimized reference lab network and software tools like VetConnect PLUS. These results highlight our progress executing against that strategy. Moving forward, we look forward to building on these initiatives to address the two-thirds of our global TAM represented by international regions. The clinical and economic benefits of growing our installed base of premium instruments on CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue are notable. Let's take an example of Catalyst, our chemistry analyzer and our Catalyst SDMA slide or SDMA in combination with total T4. In 2022, customers ran and paid for over 5 million SDMA slides on a global basis and well over 40,000 clinics supported by VetConnect PLUS and IDEXX DecisionIQ. These are customers who have decided that SDMA and early biomarker for kidney impairment is a clinically important parameter in a wide variety of use cases. It's a great example of IDEXX brings not just highly differentiated innovations to our customers, but then invest in creating awareness, education, adoption and ultimately, continued utilization as part of our sector development strategy. Next, an update on our software strategy and our progress in delivering an integrated solution of information management with our reference lab and point-of-care diagnostics platforms. IDEXX software and diagnostic imaging businesses continued to deliver high placement and recurring revenue growth. This business includes an end-to-end stack of software products that create a seamless connected ecosystem across the whole tech clinic, which in turn enables deeper diagnostic insights, supports pet owner communications creates workflow efficiencies and help support greater diagnostics usage and revenue growth. Customers have never had a greater need for these solutions, as capacity constraints in some instances have limited their ability to support patient demand. This is evidenced by record PIMS placements and high-teens growth in Web PACS subscribers in 2022, which helped drive a continued shift towards recurring revenue for this business. On a full year basis, software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached over $250 million, up 15% organically. As we expand our software business, our recurring revenues are growing even faster, supporting strong gains in profit contribution and also reinforcing the value of software as a stand-alone business. PIMS placements continue to be driven by customer adoption of cloud-based solutions. As we highlighted at Investor Day this past year, the cloud is gaining momentum rapidly in the veterinary software space. We are in the midst of a significant shift towards these type of products and IDEXX's software portfolio is very well positioned to address this trend towards efficient, easy-to-use cloud-based solutions. Cloud-based PIMS comprise approximately 90% of placements in 2022, delivering a durable revenue stream and significant benefits to CAG gross margins over the -- given the SaaS-based model for these products. We are on track for cloud-based PIMS to represent over 50% of our global footprint this year and expect this shift to accelerate over the rest of this decade. These results were achieved while our software team was tasked with delivering the rapid integration of the ezyVet solution into our business, a multiyear priority that is tracking well and driving revenue and profit delivery ahead of the expectations established during the acquisition process. This progress is a great example of how IDEXX consistently delivers high levels of return on invested capital by deploying resources in the right place at the right time and delivering seamless execution and integration. This not only benefits our financial performance but also drives the sector forward and puts world-class products and enhance of our customers. Our software business will continue to provide attractive, highly synergistic investment opportunities. The early success of our cloud-first strategy, anchored by ezyVet positions IDEXX well over the coming years as software and cloud data products increased in relevance and importance to veterinary clinics. In addition to this excellent software performance, strong commercial results were also supported by IDEXX's relentless focus on innovation as a key driver of diagnostics adoption and utilization. 2022 is an exciting year of innovation for IDEXX in multiple ways, starting with continued strong adoption of our ProCyte One premium hematology analyzer, which launched in 2021. The ProCyte One offers customers very high clinical performance in an efficient, lower cost and smaller footprint platform. It is critical to our efforts to address the approximately 240,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity given its relevance submitting hematology first international countries and its high attach rates catalyst. Worldwide placements grew 16% for ProCyte One in the fourth quarter, elevating the installed base of this new piece of technology to more than 8,000 units. This is very strong progress against our target for 20,000 incremental premium hematology placements by 2026, and we look forward to building on this momentum to achieve our long-term goals. In terms of more recent innovation launches, we were excited to announce multiple expansions to our preventive care solutions recently at VMX. These program extensions will provide veterinarians with deeper insights and allow them to detect issues sooner and include the launch of IDEXX Nu.Q Canine Cancer Screen now available at our U.S. Reference hub network, which expands our growing oncology platform by adding a more accessible way for veterinarians to screen for a disease that impacts nearly 6 million dogs annually in the U.S. And secondly, the rollout of IDEXX Preventive Care Simple Start, formerly preventive care challenge, an improved wellness program designed for the capacity-constrained practice, which includes staff training and tools for custom diagnostic profile development and client communications. At VMX, we also shared an expansion to the menu for IDEXX DecisionIQ, formerly clinical decision support which now includes endocrine features in addition to the vector-borne disease and chronic kidney disease conditions we rolled out earlier in 2022. This software service applies intelligent insights, to patient-specific data and delivers next step considerations in VetConnect PLUs. Valuable insights would support veterinarians to swiftly and confidently move through a case. Innovation does not stop at the point of launching a new product. However, integrating new technology into practice workflows and protocols and supporting customers with our medical consulting group is an important step in driving adoption and utilization of our diagnostic solutions. We have recently seen good traction in this area with some of our products and services, which were launched in 2022. Our approved 4Dx Plus in fecal, DX antigen test with detection of flea tapeworms are now included with the Preventive Care Simple Start program we announced at VMX. Another example is FGF23. And a biomarker that helps determine dietary phosphate restriction in cats with kidney disease that is offered through our reference labs has now been integrated into updated International Renal Interest Society Guidelines. These product rollouts are critical to our long-term efforts to develop the companion animal diagnostics and information management sector. They help drive the consistent positive contribution to sector diagnostics revenue growth for both diagnostics frequency and utilization that we saw in 2022 and continued adoption of new technologies to help build off these higher levels in 2023. The relentless focus on innovation demonstrates IDEXX's commitment to developing our sector and highlights our customer-first approach, which aims to address the most pressing needs of veterinarians. In this context, diagnostics has become an integral way for veterinarians to enable the provision of medical services and to grow their practices, reflecting same-store clinical diagnostics revenue growth of 7% that is outpacing total practice and clinical revenue gains and becoming a larger contribution to practice profitability. Our customers are hungry for solutions that help them deliver a higher standard of care and help support workflow, client communications and staff productivity. An additional key element necessary to provide this enablement is product and service continuity and turnaround time. For these reasons, it is of great importance that IDEXX gives our customers confidence and reinsurance that the products and services they need, will be available when and where they need them. Our supply chain teams ensured this continuity by delivering 99% product availability and on-time delivery levels again in the fourth quarter. A standard we achieved in each quarter of 2022. This performance gives us a pride to confidently say that if and when our customers ever need our help, where they help them. And in turn, our customers reward us with high retention levels and world-class NPS scores for our products and services. This customer-first mindset is fundamental to our strategy and we look forward to bringing it to our work on a daily basis in 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we transition to Q&A, I would like to recognize our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing passion and high levels of performance, which supported solid growth in 2022 in a very dynamic external environment. Their work helps us work towards providing a better future for animals, people, our planet today, while also addressing the significant sector development opportunity ahead of us. It's an honor to report the results of this excellent execution against our strategic priorities, and it's exciting to share how IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So on behalf of the management team, I'll say thank you to our colleagues for the enthusiasm and engagement you bring to our work every day. You are at the core of our progress we've made against our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. With that, we'll now open the line for Q&A Good morning, Nate. Yes. I would just qualitatively add that what we see from a market standpoint and customer standpoint, is the -- they made good progress in working through some of the capacity constraints they're not all working at the same pace. We've seen a bolus of practices who have adjusted care workflows, added staff particularly licensed veterinarians per overall veterinarian. So, the mix is more towards staff, and they've been able to increase productivity in that sense. So, I think just as we forecasted, it's taken time but I think the profession is making the progress. They're investing in technology. We've seen that with the purchase and inflation of our in-clinic laboratory software solutions particularly cloud-based software solutions is something that veterinarians are looking to as a way of supporting staff productivity, client communications, just overall workflow optimization within the practice. Yes. So let me take the back end of your question first. It is. So this is a global approach that we've taken, and we think pricing is appropriate within the current context. I'll say from a qualitative standpoint, we see demand holding up well relative to both the back impacts in the economy as well as the different pricing scenarios we've articulated. Keep in mind that from a customer standpoint, they're highly appreciative and they value the overall IDEXX value proposition, goods and services and they recognize that on a sustained basis, we've invested and we'll continue to invest in innovation, but also the customer experience, which is critically important to them so that they can focus on providing care and don't have to worry about diagnostic service levels and just overall product continuity. The other thing that I would say is they also recognize that we have taken a technology for life type approach. If you take a look at our catalyst, our chemistry analyzer over the last decade, there have been nine parameter extensions or upgrades so that a customer who purchased. Our catalysts, chemistry analyzer today or 10 years ago would have the exact same features and functionality. And we think that's highly differentiated, not just in our industry, but really in the industry. Yes. Chris, we're not projecting beyond this year, so this is guidance for 2023. We recognize just as a pricing philosophy. We want to maintain a good balance between the value we deliver, the price of our testing services. Keep in mind also that veterinary practices that the diagnostics is a core neighbor medical services within the practice. It's a large profit center for them. They typically mark it up. But having said that, we want to make sure we don't get in front of where the value is. And we're taking a very long-term approach to developing the overall sector. So and you've seen that historically. And the way we've reported it, I think the difference in 2022 and 2023 as inflation and the macroeconomic cost impacts of running the business. Yes. Let me pick up on that of the long-term potential. We see two-thirds of the future TAM outside our U.S. geography. And so that's something that we've invested in. Over time, we've had seven expansions, commercial expansions over the last few years. Currently, there's some macro headwinds as Brian described them, but I think the opportunity is very significant over time and we're approaching it in a similar way that we've approached our sector development in the U.S., which is through innovation, through engagement with our commercial model as partners and really helping create awareness and education and ultimately, adoption. So, we're very optimistic over the longer term. We think also, I would just highlight the role that ProCyte One has played in our international geography. It's a very compelling solution. Our customers, it fits from a performance profile, cost standpoint. Many of these markets are hematology first markets, and we're seeing very nice uptake, and we expect, as we've laid out at Investor Day, that 20,000 premium hematology placements over the planning horizon. Yes. No, we haven't provided any specifics on the two new point-of-care platforms. And as we get closer to launch, we'll talk about this. Yes. I would also add, just on the commercial front, we're back to more of a normal type operational cadence. We attended the VMX and VMX was the biggest show in its history. We've had sales summits from a customer visit standpoint, our field organization is -- the majority of visits are now in person. So it's much more of a pre- pandemic type operational cadence. Yes. We've said for a long time, the diagnostics market is a very attractive market. There's a lot of competitive intensity. Nothing has changed on that front. We believe that through the customer lens that our overall solution portfolio is highly differentiated the combination of our in-clinic laboratory reference laboratory software, the connectivity of it all really helped support the practice mission. We see that if you take a look at our new and competitive placements, which we provided both for Catalyst and now for premium hematology, we're doing extremely well. We're growing our software in Web PACS and Diagnostic Imaging businesses very well. We feel very good about our focus on the customers and helping them to achieve their goals and we think it's reflected in the results. Yes. I would just add to that, if you take a look at the execution metrics around customer retention, new customer acquisition, Brian highlighted price realization, which we think is appropriate given the current context. Overall, commercial execution has been excellent, and we anticipate being able to continue to execute well in the current year. Ryan. So, we have not -- we continue to see that customers would use one modality and diagnostics tend to use more of the other modality and vice versa. It's testing begets testing. We've seen a continuation of that trend. We've also seen wellness versus non-wellness testing hold up well. We think that that's really a function of pet owner demand. Pet owners want to be able to get the great care, whether for health, happiness, even longevity of their pet. So, they're filling into the practices and for wellness and preventive care visits. So, we continue to see that as an important aspect of developing the overall sector. We do see practices I think, to a greater extent than in previous times. I appreciate the role of their staff, retaining their staff, investing in education of their staff. I think they've gotten smarter around the use of technology in the importance of technology. We've seen that in software and the move to cloud-based PIM systems, but also the applications that that integrate and extend the capability of their PIM systems. So, we think that overall, even given the overall macro impacts that we've described, pet owner and consumer demand has held up relatively well. I'd be glad to. Yes, DecisionIQ is what formerly known as clinical decision support as part of our VetConnect PLUS application. Keep in mind, just let me paint the broader context here is that the general practitioner is incredibly busy. They're responsible for this wide range of clinical and medical services and having DecisionIQ, which can support the decision-making, which can suggest the possible things that they may not have considered. And even I think to your question or point, suggest next step test, we think, is an important tool in the hands of veterinarians. We have tens of thousands of practices on a global basis, which are now using VetConnect PLUS and therefore DecisionIQ as part of their daily practice, the ability to support vector-borne disease and now endocrine is that menu will continue to be extended over time. So, it's becoming increasingly valuable in the hands of veterinarians and something that we think over time will just grow in value. But thank you for that question. That's a wrap. We're out of time. I'd like to thank everyone, and that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I appreciate your participation this morning. So in summary, we see a significant decade-long opportunity to increase the standard of care for companion animal health care and remain committed to our consistent strategic approach to address this opportunity. Sustain high levels of performance by IDEXX teams enabled us to build on the decades-long investments in innovation, infrastructure and commercial capabilities to deliver solid growth and strong financial returns in 2022 and positions us well for 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our third quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue and profit growth in Q3, building on strong prior results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 8% organically supported by 9% organic growth and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics remain strong. This is reflected in record Q3 premium instrument placements, double digit growth in veterinary software and digital imaging revenues and 10% organic growth and U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 12% and 13% respectively, on a comparable basis reflecting solid gross margin gains and controlled operating expense growth. Outstanding execution in the quarter has us on track to deliver a strong full year financial performance aligned with our updated guidance range In terms of our full year operational outlook, we've incorporated our Q3 organic growth results and maintained a similar midpoint estimate for EPS performance, supported by strong second half comparable operating profit gains. We've also adjusted our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We'll walk through the details of a full year outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 12% organic growth in water and 7% organic growth and LPD revenue. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions net of a 1% equivalent day growth headwind. We achieved double digit organic growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, consistent new business gains sustained high customer retention levels, and solid expansion of diagnostic revenues per clinical visit, including benefits from higher net price realization. These gains helped IDEXX to deliver continued solid CAG recurring revenue growth, offsetting near term headwinds related to year-on-year declines in clinic visit levels globally, including effects from a pullback in clinic capacity this year, and macro impacts in international markets. Overall, organic revenue gains are also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly compared to high prior levels, as strong placement gains were moderated by mix effects. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers continued healthy trend support and solid increases in diagnostic revenues at U.S. clinics. Diagnostic revenue increased 7% on the same store basis in the U.S. in Q3, to approximately 9.5% on a per visit basis, reflecting continued solid gains in diagnostic frequency and utilization, including benefits from higher net price realization at the practice level.  Clinical visit levels in Q3 were down 2.4%, a slight improvement from Q2 trends as we continue to work through impacts from reductions in debt clinic capacity from peak levels and the lapping of the significant step up and demand for pet healthcare during the pandemic. We anticipate year-on-year visit growth headwinds will continue in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our outlook IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 9.6% in Q3, which included a 1% equivalent day's growth headwind, continues to outpace sector growth trends. The strong performance was supported by a 1,300 basis point normalized growth benefited from IDEXX execution drivers. This included consistent growth benefits from IDEXX utilization and innovation gains and customer additions and an estimated 6% net price benefit in the U.S. supported by our second half price initiatives. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q3. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 9% organically reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year on year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double digit increases across our catalyst premium hematology and set of new platforms. We placed 4,737 CAG premium instrument placements in Q3, an increase of 10% year-on-year building on the record placement levels achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflecting 30% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements, compared to strong prior levels. ProCyte One momentum also continues to build globally supporting a 26% year on year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 7% organically in Q3 compared to high prior demand levels, supported by benefits from that price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q3 as double digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by modest organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same store clinic visit growth in Europe, including macroeconomic impacts.  We continue to achieve solid new business momentum and sustained high customer retention levels across our major modalities, supporting sustained solid volume growth. CAG recurring revenue growth, including net price benefits in the range of 5% to 6% to worldwide CAG diagnose recurring revenues in the quarters reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts.  In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 12% organically in Q3, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from solid volume gains and net price improvement.  We completed the acquisition of Tecta-PDS in the quarter, an automated microbiology testing platform which complements our existing water offering and expands our capabilities in this highly attractive business segment. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. Results benefited from growth in the herd health screening and improved results in China, where we work through comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever core swine testing. Turning to the P&L. Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 7% in the quarter as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.2% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses increased 6% year-on-year as reported in the third quarter and 9% on a comparable basis. As planned, operating expense growth was more in-line with revenue gains as we prioritize investments and gained leverage from our prior commercial expansions. EPS was $2.15 per share, an increase of 13% on a comparable basis. Q3 EPS results did not include tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were down $0.05 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million and EPS by $0.08 per share in Q3 net of $9 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $151 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 67%. For the full year, we've updated our estimate of free cash flow conversion to 60% to 65% to incorporate expectations for continued higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining high product availability.  The full year outlook reflects approximately 20% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels, higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D tax credits and an investment in the major facility expansion. We've updated our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $165 million, including $40 million to $50 million in 2022 spending for our new manufacturing and warehouse project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash.  We increased our financing flexibility with the recently completed credit facility amendment, which provides for a $250 million term loan on attractive terms with proceeds applied to reducing our revolving credit balance. In Q3, we allocated $167 million of capital to repurchase 453,000 shares. Capital allocation to share repurchases supports our projected 2% full year reduction in share count this year. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're narrowing the organic revenue growth range to incorporate our solid Q3 performance and a consistent outlook for Q4 organic revenue growth aligned with the midpoint of our prior second half guidance. We're also maintaining our full year outlook for comparable operating margins, which sustained strong prior year levels, adjusting for the impact of the discrete $80 million R&D investment recorded in Q2. We're updating our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce 2022 revenue by $10 million and EPS by $0.04 per share compared to our last outlook. We're also factoring in a $0.01 per share adjustment for projected changes in interest rates. Overall, our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.325 billion to $3.365 billion is consistent at midpoint with earlier estimates as FX impacts offset improvements to our operational outlook. We now project FX will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 4% for the full year with approximately 6% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q4. Our updated full year organic revenue growth outlook is now 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting a full year CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 7.5% to 8.5%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies fourth quarter organic gains of 5% to 10%, aligned with earlier estimates, which factors in a 2.5% organic growth risk estimate at the low end of the range for potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. We've updated our estimated full year operating margins to 26.3% to 26.8%, reflecting consistent operational outlook at midpoint and an estimated 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin impact from updated foreign exchange estimates. This outlook reflects a projected 230 to 280 basis point decrease on a comparable basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of operating margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.74 a share to $7.98 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of approximately 5% per share at midpoint, reflecting updated estimates for FX and interest rate impacts. For the full year, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by approximately $28 million and EPS by $0.25 per share. This is net of an estimated $29 million or $0.26 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. Our outlook factors in no EPS impact from stock-based compensation tax benefits in the second half. We provided details on our updated outlook in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. Looking forward, we're advancing our planning processes for 2023. We're targeting sustained strong execution that supported delivery of solid organic revenue and comparable profit growth, building on substantial financial gains IDEXX achieved through the pandemic. Given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar this year, in 2023, we estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported revenue growth by approximately 3%, reported operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.45 per share at the rates assumed in our press release with current hedge positions. We'll provide updates on these estimates as we share our 2023 guidance on the year-end conference call.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX delivered strong results in the third quarter, as teams across the company continued excellent execution to advance our strategic priorities. Demand for Companion Animal health care remains high, building on stepped-up levels there in the pandemic supported by a continued focus on service within veterinary clinics. Veterinarians are looking for partners to support their growth while they provide high levels of care in an efficient manner.  These professionals continue to turn to IDEXX for the support in the third quarter. This was reflected in yet another quarter of record placements of premium capital instruments, strong momentum in PIMS placements its continued desire for cloud-native products, consistent new business gains and sustained high customer retention levels. These continued trends demonstrate that veterinarians appreciate IDEXX's integrated ecosystem, and the layers of innovation would support and improve each step of clinic workflows.  The result was expansion across IDEXX execution growth drivers, including relatively higher net price realization, which drove IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to significantly outpace clinical visit growth. This supported a solid same-store diagnostics revenue growth in the U.S. despite moderating impacts from reductions in clinic capacity levels this year. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in the quarter while delivering strong financial results. I'll begin with a review of recent trends in the companion animal sector. Third quarter CAG sector trends were supported by solid global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in pet ownership and patient visits during the pandemic. U.S. same-store diagnostics revenues grew 7% per practice during the third quarter, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and well above total same-store practice revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Services remain a key focus for veterinarians. And within services, diagnostics is a key component in providing valuable health care insights, supporting practice economics and driving revenue growth. Consistent with trends through this year, diagnostics revenue growth at the practice level continues to be driven by increases in both the frequency and utilization of diagnostics, resulting in 9.5% growth in diagnostics revenue per visit for the quarter, building on the strong gains seen through the pandemic. IDEXX grew overall U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 10% normalized despite recent clinic visit growth headwinds as we benefit from decades of focus and investment, which brings differentiated value to our customers. As Brian noted, IDEXX execution drivers contributed approximately 1,300 basis points to U.S. growth in Q3 on a normalized basis. This reflects benefits from continued expansion of our premium instrument installed base, adoption of IDEXX innovations, consistent business gains, record retention levels and increased price realization. On a multiyear basis, critical visit growth was healthy in the quarter with solid growth in both wellness and non-wellness visits. three-year CAGR wellness visit growth, in particular, was in line with historic trends of 2% to 3%, demonstrating that U.S. pet owners are continuing to prioritize pet health care. This trend continues to be supported by IDEXX's turnkey Preventive Care program, which included approximately 200 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter. This is the second quarter of year-over-year increased enrollments, showing that customers continue to appreciate the simple yet comprehensive testing and pet owner communication tools included in this program. This program is just one example of how we are engaging with our customers to support them through near-term challenges related to managing clinic capacity in meeting growing demand for health care services. We are building on our strong customer relationships to drive continued solid organic growth in our CAG business. With that, let's now turn to discuss IDEXX's strong progress against our key strategic growth initiatives. As mentioned, excellent execution across the IDEXX organization supported strong performance during a dynamic third quarter with commercial teams delivering the day while also building the foundation for long-term growth across regions. Record quarterly placements of premium instruments supported another quarter of double-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base.  Global premium instrument placements grew 10% in the quarter. and placements in new and competitive accounts grew even faster at 13%, supporting strong EVI gains across regions. These results, combined with continued sustained new business gains and 98% Catalyst customer retention rates, will support future recurring revenue growth aligned with the long-term financial framework shared at our recent Investor Day. Sustained high levels of commercial performance were aided in part by continued improvement in the rate of in-person visits for account managers, up to 75% in the U.S. and nearly 70% in Europe. IDEXX sales representatives are welcome in the clinic as trusted advisers to their customers, adding value by helping customers provide high standards of medical care, drive strong practice economics and improve practice efficiency. These results are also supported by our world-class innovative products like ProCyte One and customer-friendly marketing programs that help support the adoption of IDEXX Innovations. ProCyte One provides customers with an efficient lower-cost hematology platform at the point of care and is especially sought after in international regions where veterinarians have been trained to do hematology testing first when doing a basic workup on a patient. This platform is integral to our strategy to address the approximately 230,000 long-term global instrument placement opportunity that Dr. Tina Hunt shared at Investor Day, and third quarter results continue to be very encouraging. ProCyte One was a key driver of 26% growth in premium hematology placements in the quarter with international regions representing approximately 75% of ProCyte One placements and more than 60% of its installed base. Attach rates for ProCyte One are consistently high. Over 95% of ProCyte One customers overall and more than 80% of competitive customers also utilize our chemistry platform, demonstrating the excellent placement quality and strong multiplier benefit of this platform. These results are further supported by benefits from investments we have made to expand our global commercial organization, where we are seeing positive reach to revenue trends and deeper customer relationships. Customer survey work in Germany and France demonstrates that customers have had an overwhelmingly positive experience during the first year of the new commercial ecosystem.  Over 90% of customers in Germany, for example, indicate that their commercial experience is the same or better than a year ago with the highest satisfaction rates and practices to receive continuous commercial engagement. This feedback highlights the benefit of our high-touch commercial model, where diagnostic subject matter experts partner with practice centers and staff to drive practice patient care and business objectives. Our commercial and operational teams in the Asia-Pacific region are also driving successful execution against our strategic plans. Asia-Pacific premium instrument placements are at a record high and were delivered while hiring and onboarding new sales professionals in Japan and opening a new reference lab in Brisbane, Australia during the quarter. Concurrent seamless execution of our commercial investments across multiple regions is not easy to do and to do so while also delivering against our business goals. This demonstrates the value of the investments we've made in these teams, which will continue to benefit us as we work to address the significant long-term addressable opportunity outside the U.S. In addition to these excellent commercial results, we also delivered multiple new technologies to our customers during the quarter. Since VMX in January, we have announced eight new product service and software solution enhancements across IDEXX modalities, each of which add value to the relationship that customers have with IDEXX while demonstrating our commitment to a technology for life strategy. Five out of eight of these projects were launched in the third quarter. These are number one, expanding the comprehensiveness of our fecal antigen reference lab test by adding a flea tapeworm assay, which now detects up to 5 times more than traditional methods. Number two, providing faster access to PCR results for North American customers by opening a next day PCR lab in Louisville.  Number three, improved veterinary insight into the treatment of feline chronic kidney disease by adding an improved disease marker, FGF23, to our reference lab menu. Number four, improving the efficiency, convenience and sustainability of the Catalyst SDMA test by reformulating the test to include onboard reagents. And number five, delivering enhanced accuracy and longer room temperature storage in our best-in-class 4Dx Plus Test.  The rollout of these new products and services was enthusiastically received by our customers and highlighted the IDEXX team's ability to deliver high-quality new products, which will help increase standards of animal health care and develop our sector while also providing very high customer service levels. Another strategic area of innovation is IDEXX's software and diagnostic imaging businesses, which include a full suite of software product offerings to create a connected ecosystem within the clinic that supports each step clinic workflow through the patient appointment, the practice information management system and its easily updatable customer-friendly front-end interface is the center of this solution. Record third quarter PIMS placements highlight strong customer interest the whole product solution at IDEXX offers. Furthermore, the shift to cloud-based products that we highlighted at Investor Day continued in the quarter as over 90% of placements were cloud-based subscriptions, reflecting 50% growth in cloud-based placements compared to the prior year and demonstrating the value that last year's ezyVet acquisition continues to bring to the business. Strong results across this business in the quarter were not limited to PIMS products, diagnostic imaging systems placements, Web PACS subscriptions, PIMS application adoption like payment processing and VetConnect PLUS with clinical decision support, engaged with all advanced at healthy levels in the quarter. We know veterinarians are looking for ways to obtain, understand and communicate diagnostics insights in a digital and streamlined way, and our software portfolio is well positioned to provide them with these solutions. The benefits of these products and solutions to IDEXX and our customers are compelling. They have highly favorable economics given the recurring nature of the revenue stream and high incremental gross margins. They also drive customer engagement, which supports a high levels of retention since they improve our customers' productivity and overall experience. IDEXX's innovation agenda also extends beyond our Companion Animal business. We recently took the opportunity to advance our water business by acquiring Tecta Pathogen Detection System, with an automated microbiology detection platform that uses patented technology to automate the incubation, reading and results notification for E. Coli and total coliform testing and drinking water supplies. This application provides an automated data-enabled instrument in EPA-approved coliform testing solution that complements our core water solutions by providing value for customers operating under rushed conditions. We're excited to be able to invest in the attractive area of water testing and leverage our commercial resources to scale this new technology. This innovation agenda demonstrates a relentless focus on providing our customers with world-class products that increase in value over time. Products not only provide them with important insights but also help increase workflow efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to these top-notch products, our customer focus is supported by extremely high service levels to ensure customers have a wonderful experience with IDEXX, allowing us to earn their business every day. Our frontline supply chain and customer service teams continue to deliver high levels of service, reflected in another quarter of approximately 99% product availability despite ongoing challenges in the external environment. This strong performance leverages years of investment in our supply chain and customer support resources as we continue to deliver on the operational needs of our customers. That concludes our review. I'm proud to report another quarter of strong results as IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long run while also delivering on our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. Our performance reflects the commitment and talent of our IDEXX team.  On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank our more than 10,000 colleagues for the passion and engagement they bring to our purpose and strategy every day. You're making a meaningful difference to the health and well-being at pets, people and buy stock around the world.  So now we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I was just trying to get a little bit more color on how you're thinking about vet visit growth dynamics as we look out to 2023. I don't know if it's premature to get a view there. But maybe just, qualitatively, can you just elaborate on what you think needs to happen for vet visit growth to start growing again and I guess just where we are in that process as we're trying to get -- hands around kind of the trajectory of the business as we look out to next year? Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Chris. We expect we'll work through the impacts of the pullback in capacity this year in 2023. The overall clinic visit growth, as you indicated in the outlook, it still remains fairly dynamic. There's a lot of external factors like macro impacts, the labor supply dynamics that we've talked about and even potential impacts from further COVID outbreak. So we'll be monitoring those macro impacts as a pet owner behavior and really factor that into our outlook.  What I would point out is that our focus is on those things that we can control from an execution standpoint, both innovations and commercial engagement with our commercial teams. And we continue to do extremely well in being able to support customers with technology, whether it's PIMS systems, software, which help their productivity and support their efficiency. Clinic instrument placements -- in-clinic instrument placements were at record levels. I think that reflects at a basic level that there is a very positive outlook on the industry, and their willingness to invest, it really supports growth. We think that, from an overall dynamic standpoint, Europe is a little bit different. But in the U.S., capacity constraints are the primary factor affecting clinical visits versus end customer demand. In Europe, we're seeing some impacts from just the back row factors, and we'll see how that plays out and whether that continues going forward.\nChris Schott : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America Global Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Bhuvan [ph] on for Mike. Thanks for taking questions. It looks like you -- as you mentioned, the oU.S. results were a bit softer this quarter. I was wondering if you could just go a little deeper into what you're seeing internationally and your expectations for how trends will look there going forward versus the U.S.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question. In international markets, we're seeing similar dynamics in terms of IDEXX execution. So the we highlighted in our comments that we think we got a 1,300 basis point benefit from the combination of things like new business gains, expansion of our premium instrument installed base, price utilization. And we actually think our numbers are roughly in a similar zone in international markets. I think what we're seeing more in international markets is some pressure on the clinical visit growth levels. You can see that in our lab growth, which was up modestly in the quarter despite these new business gains and solid price gains.  So it's -- I think international market has been relatively more impacted by the macro dynamics, particularly in regions like Europe. And we've been seeing that really going back to Q4 of last year. So that's been a relatively more meaningful headwind, but the progress that we're making and the very strong instrument placement gains and continued high retention levels, excellent level -- excellent engagement with our customers is allowing us to deliver solid, continued growth.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Just to add to that, the fit of our in-clinic instruments now with ProCyte One is outstanding for these international markets. We saw ProCyte One growth 26%, as I indicated in my comments. And so from a footprint, price, performance, connectivity, ease-of-use standpoint, it really fits us international markets very well.  The international customers, it depends based on country or region, but they tend to test hematology first. So it's a really important solution for these customers and has a big multiplier impact because very often when we sell ProCyte One, we also sell it with a chemistry analyzer and, in some cases, even a SediVue. So we feel very positive about solutions and our ability to help customers achieve their objectives. Certainly, there's a macro factors that we've talked about in the past, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the energy prices, and we'll just continue to monitor that and see how that plays out over time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Much appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking my question s. So on pricing, where do we stand now in terms of net price realization for the year? What's embedded in guidance? And what's that relative to what you were disclosing last quarter? And then are there further price increases, I guess, embedded for the remainder of the year? And then how should we think about your ability to take incremental price in 2023? And are you seeing any pushback there from customers? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question, Erin. Our price realization is very much in line with what we shared at Investor Day. So we had roughly 4% price realization coming out of the second quarter. We're advantaging some additional price increases in the second half. As I mentioned, globally, we were in the 5% to 6% range. In Q3, it was at the higher end of that for the U.S., and that's very much in line with the 5.5% to 6% year-on-year benefit that was implied in our -- for the second half, and that equates to 5% for the full year.  So as we head into 2023, we will have carryover benefits from the pricing that we've achieved this year, including the second half initiatives. Our plan is to have a normally timed price increase. So we'll have an additional increase at the beginning of the year, and we'll share more details on that as we roll that out, but that will incorporate the conditions that we're seeing in terms of the value that we're adding and also inflationary impacts in the business.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, I would just add to that, that from a customer perspective, what customers are most interested in and the message we keep hearing back from them, is they want to make sure that from a product testing continuity standpoint, supply chain, how we support them that all those pieces are in place. And they realize that, given the current environment, it's a little bit more expensive to run the business, and they want us to invest in being able to support them. And we see that reflected in very high customer retention rates really globally across the world. We think that's an important input or input into the growth formula of the company. So that's an area we're going to continue to invest in. And as Brian indicated, we think our pricing approach on balance, very reasonable, given the current environment.\nErin Wright : Okay. Thanks. And then on 2023, the FX dynamics here are understandable given the environment that we're in. But how are you thinking about CAG recurring organic growth in 2023, just given the price realization that you are seeing and the ability to kind of assume a more potentially stable vet clinic growth as you kind of lap some of the labor dynamics assuming that those don't get forced but don't get better either? I guess, is high single-digit CAG recurring growth the right way to think about 2023? Or what are some of those dynamics as we think about the headwinds and tailwinds into 2023? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: I think that we'll share more on that, obviously, as we get further along here. You're pointing out some positive factors that I think will be helpful for us heading into next year. I think the price realization is higher than we've achieved historically. We think it's appropriate in the current environment, and that will be a positive dynamic. And as Jay mentioned, we do think we'll work through some of the headwinds related to the capacity pullback that we saw this year. I think it's early for us to talk about the trajectory into next year, just given the macro backdrops. We'll gain more insight here and focus on what we can do, which is to execute well, and we think that will position us for continued solid growth, and we'll share more of those details as we complete our plans and give you an update on the year-end call.\nJay Mazelsky: I think what's -- just to add to Brian's comments, what's been very gratifying is the resonance and, I think, interest amongst our customers of our solutions. I talked about software. But our customers pretty much across the board are feeling pressures. There may be capacity pressures or and or staff pressures within their practices and trying to run a business, delivering excellent medical care but also sensitive to the economics and making sure they have a healthy business.  And they're looking to software solutions. So we see this with our PIMs solutions, cloud-based PIMS solutions and their enthusiasm around really upgrading software within their practices that help support workflow optimization, staff productivity, client communications, all the things that they've been looking for. So I think we have the right solutions at the right time given the market circumstances. We're seeing that in clinic pretty much across the board, across all the solutions.  And even at our Reference Lab, had really nice mouth, especially in the U.S. As we look -- we've expanded our menu. We've improved our service offerings in the case of PCR at Louisville, which is next day, if customers would like that. And they're using that as an extension of their own practice. So we're optimistic that, for those things that we can control, we'll do a good job and that customers are highly enthusiastic about these solutions.\nErin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you, \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll start with clinical visits. They were down 2.4% year-over-year, but it looks like wellness performed a bit better than Emergent and that just seems at odds with just capacity issues in the U.S. which would -- I'm thinking would be more acute on the wellness side of the equation. So can you guys just talk about what you're seeing out there and why this is weighing more on and why we're not seeing sort of the capacity issues hit emergent more, right? Why is the wellness performing better?  And then just maybe your thoughts, is this just also a return to work dynamic, right, people going back to work maybe noticing less things about their dog or cat, and that's just crimping the emergent volume a bit around the edges? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Jon, on balance, I mean, on balance, there is some variability within any given quarter. But if you look at over a two-three year CAGR rate there, it's pretty -- it's what you would -- might expect. So I don't think there's anything specifically related to capacity. The capacity speaks to the length in getting an appointment. And with existing pet owners, most veterinarians aren't turning those folks away whether it's a wellness visit or a sick visit. So you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any dynamic related that piece of it. We know that people are going back to work, at least in a hybrid fashion. We haven't been able to pull out anything specifically related to return to work, whether it's two or three days a year. What we do see is capacity pullback, especially on weekends, has gone down somewhat over the year, and we think that just reflects practices or maybe short of staff and trying to balance their working environment better, better for their employees. But nothing specific that I think we can call out or point to.\nJon Block : Okay. I guess I could just follow up with you offline for more color there. Just to move on, I think I have some of these numbers correct, but you mentioned the 4,700 and change premium instruments. I think that was up 10% year-over-year, but the vet instrument revenue was down 5% organic, if I've got that correct. So a lot of those premium instruments are the relatively new ProCyte One, which I think would have a solid ASP.  Can you just talk about the discrepancy between, call it, the premium placement instruments, the growth, I think, again, up 10%, the organic instruments down 5% and then what that delta means? Are you getting just a little bit more aggressive in terms of some of the selling programs, maybe that's an IDEXX 360 and the trade-off there sort of in return for longer-term commitments from some of those customers? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, Jon, it's primarily related to both geographic mix. We're selling more internationally and then product mix more ProCyte Ones, which have a lower AUP than the ProCyte Dx. So the ProCyte One grew 26%. It's a lower AUP. The international mix was higher. And so that -- I think that accounts for the 5% drop in revenue on a very, very strong placement rate.\nJon Block : That accounts for the 1,500 basis point delta between up 10% and down 5%, no selling programs have evolved?\nBrian McKeon: There are impacts from selling programs as well. I think we feel very good about the expansion of 360. We've seen very high attach rates of replacing ProCyte Ones. We're replacing Catalysts, and that's really the multiplier benefit that we've had to highlight and that gets folded into the 360-type agreement. So that's part of the dynamic as well. But largely, it's the factors that Jay was highlighting. The bulk of our growth is in international markets, and that's a meaningful driver of some of the relative revenue changes.  And -- but on balance, the overall growth in our base is very strong. Our EVI metrics were up at high levels. Consumable gains are strong. The instrument base expansion is a big driver of our execution growth benefit. So we feel really good about the instrument performance.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. One driver, we focus on from just the quality of instrument replacements is new and competitive Catalyst because that drives an outsized portion of the consumables revenue and the clinic business, and that was up 13%. And so that's a reflection of just, I think, the focus of our commercial organization and the importance of chemistry consumables to the business.\nJon Block : Good color. Thanks, guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow up on the price realization. I guess, how are you thinking about customer sensitivity to price increases in this market? I guess given the 1,300 basis point normalized spread that you referenced, it doesn't appear to have had an impact on volumes. But could you maybe just elaborate on any potential impacts on demand that you might see as we move forward?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Thanks, Nate. And good morning. Our customers, I think, see this -- see our pricing as reasonable given the current environment. They know it's more expensive for them to run their businesses. I think they see -- continue to see really good end customer demand within the clinics. And their focus is really on they want to make sure they get the support from a product continuity, testing results on time, the engagement that we provide with the customer technical support organization. So their primary focus is on that. Pricing -- the flip side of pricing is the value that we deliver, and we continue to deliver extremely high value. We've had eight product introductions or enhancements this year, just five in Q3 alone, really across the business in software, reference labs and our clinic businesses. And so that helps them from both the standpoint of delivering better patient care but also productivity and efficiency within the practice, and I appreciate that. And from the standpoint of their own -- they have the ability from an end customer pet owner pricing standpoint to increase prices. They've done that. I think diagnostics is a small piece of their overall cost envelope, but it drives the important health care services envelope for their practice. So they see this as a really core enabler to what they do.\nNathan Rich : Thanks. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the 4Q CAG Dx guidance. Brian, I think you had said 5% to 10%. Could you maybe just talk about what factors would put you at the high end versus low end of that range? And the midpoint is about 100 basis below what you did this quarter. I was a little surprised just given -- I know you faced a tougher compare, but I'd assume there's maybe some incremental price realization. So could you maybe just talk about your expectations for 4Q in a little bit more detail?\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. Thanks, Nate. We thought it was appropriate to maintain a similar outlook to what we had shared for the second half. I think we're very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. I think on the clinic visit growth trend side, I think that, that was a relatively favorable factor in Q3, but we're not -- that as kind of a longer-term trend. We think the trends that we've seen kind of in the last few months are appropriate kind of to plan off of, and our pricing execution is in line with our plans. So we thought the -- we really focus on the midpoint of the range. We think that's still an appropriate place to be. The lower end of the range is really reflective of potential macro risk that we think is appropriate to build in. And of course, the higher end would be if we can continue to execute well and see some improvement in the underlying visit trends. But I think the -- we think, on balance, it's a consistent outlook, and we think that's appropriate in the current environment.\nNathan Rich : Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Westerberg of Piper. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to talk about the percent of your platform that might be using learned staff versus unlearned staff and is there a means of kind of using your sales force to accelerate training of these kind of programs while we're in a supply or veterinarian supply constraint environment and vet techs? And then just as kind of a follow-up to that, can you help us reconcile the constraints in labor with kind of easing them into new platforms?  So if we are in an environment where they can't really fully capture all the clientele, do they have capacity to, say, try new cornerstone or try new platforms? And that's all the questions I have. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Good morning. We have a multifaceted strategy to really support the efficiency. Within practices, I mentioned the portfolio piece, including software. And to answer a part of your question directly, practices are taking the time to implement new PIMS systems, specifically ezyVet. They see a really good return on that -- and they're enthusiastic about moving to the cloud-based systems and, in some cases, modifying or optimizing workflow if it helps them. Specifically around the questions around training, we have a number of different platforms to be able to support the training needs and knowledge needs, practices. Some of it is clinical, some of it is business and workflow optimization, both online and in person. We have a very significantly sized field service representative organization as well as professional service vets for more peer-to-peer that's both in person into our internal medicine group over the phone. We've seen nice growth in engagement and calls into IDEXX to help support them.  So there's lots of, I think, avenues open to customers for training and practice efficiency support.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Daniels : Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, rightfully, a lot of airtime on the CAG business, but I'm hoping you could go into a bit of color on the Water and LPG in particular, kind of what the growth outlook is there if we continue to see macro headwinds, both in the U.S. How recurring is that versus somewhat sensitive to the consumer overall macro environment? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question, Ryan. Let me start with the Water business. The Water business is probably our highest recurring revenue business in terms of our customer relationships. It's very much embedded with the ongoing workflow for water safety testing, and we feel very good about the momentum in that business, as we reported 12% organic growth in the quarter.  And so I think the backdrop there is it's a strong global growth, good growth across regions. We have solid net price realization as well. And we highlighted an acquisition this quarter, which complements our product offering. And so we feel very good about the momentum in that business, building off the progress that we've made recently. LPD, as we reported, had positive growth, 7% in the quarter. We were -- have worked through the tough compares that we've been facing in recent quarters in China. And actually, we're up against really an easy compare last year in China. It was probably our toughest quarter in the year. So we've worked through that, and we saw a positive benefit from health screen as a driver. And overall, kind of modest growth, mode growth in our testing areas. I think it is an area that we're paying attention to in terms of macro backdrop. But I think we've worked through the tougher compares here and feel that we're positioned for positive growth moving forward.\nRyan Daniels : Okay. Perfect. And then my follow-up, a little bit different. Just the Preventive Care program obviously continues to roll out nicely. Can you remind us the status of that oU.S.? And given the investments you've made oU.S., is there a potential to push that more and try to make that even more recurring in the face of a potentially weak oU.S. macro environment? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We definitely are expanding Preventive Care beyond the U.S. We see a select number of markets and especially corporate accounts outside the U.S. very interested in preventive care. It's a little bit earlier stages from the standpoint of interest and adoption in some of our international country regions. But the same -- I think that's the same level of interest. It just may not be as much knowledge in terms of -- from a workflow standpoint and customer education work. That still needs to be done.  So we're making -- I think we're making progress. I would just say it's more embryonic and we think represents a solid long-term opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nElliot Wilbur : Thanks, good morning. I want to go back to the subject matter of clinical visit trends and thinking about the sequential improvement down 3.1% in the second quarter, improving to down 2.4% in 3Q. Just wondering if you could comment on the cadence of improvement over the course of the quarter, whether or not the full quarter rate is indicative of the actual exit rate. And then as a follow-up, and thinking about the trend in clinic visit trends, despite the continued declines over the last couple of quarters, it's been offset by relatively favorable diagnostic frequency per visit metric, which has been up 100 basis points the last two quarters, and I think that compares to positive 50 basis points in 1Q and longer-term average of 50 basis points.  I'm wondering if you think that, that relatively higher Dx frequency per visit metric is sustainable if, in fact, we see clinic visit trends revert to positive trends in early 2023, just sort of getting into the idea that maybe the decline in putting visit trends is more related to sort of the loss of pet owners who have perhaps a little bit more or less propensity to spend. So maybe a little bit lower quality customer has sort of been lost and that is reflected in kind of that more favorable Dx frequency number. Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Good morning, Elliot. There are a couple of different, I think, questions you're getting at. So we saw, as you indicated, a negative 2.4% clinical visit decline in the quarter. And this was a modest sequential improvement compared to Q2. But we don't really see this as a fundamental change in the trend. We continue to expect near term impacts from reductions in capacity. And obviously, the macro environment remains dynamic. We are pleased, as we've talked about, the overall diagnostics revenue per practice visit. That's both a function of adoption as well as utilization. Those two pieces, I think, are performing extremely well through the first three quarters of this year relative to historical rates. And that's, I think, the reflection -- again, getting back to the execution drivers in the business, really driving commercial engagement and innovations, the type of things that I think customers want and that supports medical services within the practice and things that are important to really delivering exceptional patient care. And so with that, that will conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning. I know we have lots of IDEXX employees listening, and I'd like to say thank you for your continued commitment to our purpose and your focus and execution against our strategy. Your continued engagement in the midst of what we all know is dynamic external factors, I think, helped deliver another excellent quarter and excellent execution. So I'm thankful for all your work, and look forward to finishing 2022 on a strong note.  And so with that, we'll conclude the call. And again, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue and profit growth in Q3, building on strong prior results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 8% organically supported by 9% organic growth and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics remain strong. This is reflected in record Q3 premium instrument placements, double digit growth in veterinary software and digital imaging revenues and 10% organic growth and U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 12% and 13% respectively, on a comparable basis reflecting solid gross margin gains and controlled operating expense growth. Outstanding execution in the quarter has us on track to deliver a strong full year financial performance aligned with our updated guidance range In terms of our full year operational outlook, we've incorporated our Q3 organic growth results and maintained a similar midpoint estimate for EPS performance, supported by strong second half comparable operating profit gains. We've also adjusted our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We'll walk through the details of a full year outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 12% organic growth in water and 7% organic growth and LPD revenue. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions net of a 1% equivalent day growth headwind. We achieved double digit organic growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, consistent new business gains sustained high customer retention levels, and solid expansion of diagnostic revenues per clinical visit, including benefits from higher net price realization. These gains helped IDEXX to deliver continued solid CAG recurring revenue growth, offsetting near term headwinds related to year-on-year declines in clinic visit levels globally, including effects from a pullback in clinic capacity this year, and macro impacts in international markets. Overall, organic revenue gains are also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly compared to high prior levels, as strong placement gains were moderated by mix effects. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers continued healthy trend support and solid increases in diagnostic revenues at U.S. clinics. Diagnostic revenue increased 7% on the same store basis in the U.S. in Q3, to approximately 9.5% on a per visit basis, reflecting continued solid gains in diagnostic frequency and utilization, including benefits from higher net price realization at the practice level.  Clinical visit levels in Q3 were down 2.4%, a slight improvement from Q2 trends as we continue to work through impacts from reductions in debt clinic capacity from peak levels and the lapping of the significant step up and demand for pet healthcare during the pandemic. We anticipate year-on-year visit growth headwinds will continue in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our outlook IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 9.6% in Q3, which included a 1% equivalent day's growth headwind, continues to outpace sector growth trends. The strong performance was supported by a 1,300 basis point normalized growth benefited from IDEXX execution drivers. This included consistent growth benefits from IDEXX utilization and innovation gains and customer additions and an estimated 6% net price benefit in the U.S. supported by our second half price initiatives. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q3. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 9% organically reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year on year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double digit increases across our catalyst premium hematology and set of new platforms. We placed 4,737 CAG premium instrument placements in Q3, an increase of 10% year-on-year building on the record placement levels achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflecting 30% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements, compared to strong prior levels. ProCyte One momentum also continues to build globally supporting a 26% year on year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 7% organically in Q3 compared to high prior demand levels, supported by benefits from that price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q3 as double digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by modest organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same store clinic visit growth in Europe, including macroeconomic impacts.  We continue to achieve solid new business momentum and sustained high customer retention levels across our major modalities, supporting sustained solid volume growth. CAG recurring revenue growth, including net price benefits in the range of 5% to 6% to worldwide CAG diagnose recurring revenues in the quarters reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts.  In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 12% organically in Q3, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from solid volume gains and net price improvement.  We completed the acquisition of Tecta-PDS in the quarter, an automated microbiology testing platform which complements our existing water offering and expands our capabilities in this highly attractive business segment. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. Results benefited from growth in the herd health screening and improved results in China, where we work through comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever core swine testing. Turning to the P&L. Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 7% in the quarter as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.2% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses increased 6% year-on-year as reported in the third quarter and 9% on a comparable basis. As planned, operating expense growth was more in-line with revenue gains as we prioritize investments and gained leverage from our prior commercial expansions. EPS was $2.15 per share, an increase of 13% on a comparable basis. Q3 EPS results did not include tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were down $0.05 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million and EPS by $0.08 per share in Q3 net of $9 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $151 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 67%. For the full year, we've updated our estimate of free cash flow conversion to 60% to 65% to incorporate expectations for continued higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining high product availability.  The full year outlook reflects approximately 20% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels, higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D tax credits and an investment in the major facility expansion. We've updated our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $165 million, including $40 million to $50 million in 2022 spending for our new manufacturing and warehouse project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash.  We increased our financing flexibility with the recently completed credit facility amendment, which provides for a $250 million term loan on attractive terms with proceeds applied to reducing our revolving credit balance. In Q3, we allocated $167 million of capital to repurchase 453,000 shares. Capital allocation to share repurchases supports our projected 2% full year reduction in share count this year. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're narrowing the organic revenue growth range to incorporate our solid Q3 performance and a consistent outlook for Q4 organic revenue growth aligned with the midpoint of our prior second half guidance. We're also maintaining our full year outlook for comparable operating margins, which sustained strong prior year levels, adjusting for the impact of the discrete $80 million R&D investment recorded in Q2. We're updating our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce 2022 revenue by $10 million and EPS by $0.04 per share compared to our last outlook. We're also factoring in a $0.01 per share adjustment for projected changes in interest rates. Overall, our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.325 billion to $3.365 billion is consistent at midpoint with earlier estimates as FX impacts offset improvements to our operational outlook. We now project FX will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 4% for the full year with approximately 6% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q4. Our updated full year organic revenue growth outlook is now 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting a full year CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 7.5% to 8.5%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies fourth quarter organic gains of 5% to 10%, aligned with earlier estimates, which factors in a 2.5% organic growth risk estimate at the low end of the range for potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. We've updated our estimated full year operating margins to 26.3% to 26.8%, reflecting consistent operational outlook at midpoint and an estimated 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin impact from updated foreign exchange estimates. This outlook reflects a projected 230 to 280 basis point decrease on a comparable basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of operating margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.74 a share to $7.98 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of approximately 5% per share at midpoint, reflecting updated estimates for FX and interest rate impacts. For the full year, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by approximately $28 million and EPS by $0.25 per share. This is net of an estimated $29 million or $0.26 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. Our outlook factors in no EPS impact from stock-based compensation tax benefits in the second half. We provided details on our updated outlook in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. Looking forward, we're advancing our planning processes for 2023. We're targeting sustained strong execution that supported delivery of solid organic revenue and comparable profit growth, building on substantial financial gains IDEXX achieved through the pandemic. Given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar this year, in 2023, we estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported revenue growth by approximately 3%, reported operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.45 per share at the rates assumed in our press release with current hedge positions. We'll provide updates on these estimates as we share our 2023 guidance on the year-end conference call.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your question. In international markets, we're seeing similar dynamics in terms of IDEXX execution. So the we highlighted in our comments that we think we got a 1,300 basis point benefit from the combination of things like new business gains, expansion of our premium instrument installed base, price utilization. And we actually think our numbers are roughly in a similar zone in international markets. I think what we're seeing more in international markets is some pressure on the clinical visit growth levels. You can see that in our lab growth, which was up modestly in the quarter despite these new business gains and solid price gains.  So it's -- I think international market has been relatively more impacted by the macro dynamics, particularly in regions like Europe. And we've been seeing that really going back to Q4 of last year. So that's been a relatively more meaningful headwind, but the progress that we're making and the very strong instrument placement gains and continued high retention levels, excellent level -- excellent engagement with our customers is allowing us to deliver solid, continued growth. Thanks for your question, Erin. Our price realization is very much in line with what we shared at Investor Day. So we had roughly 4% price realization coming out of the second quarter. We're advantaging some additional price increases in the second half. As I mentioned, globally, we were in the 5% to 6% range. In Q3, it was at the higher end of that for the U.S., and that's very much in line with the 5.5% to 6% year-on-year benefit that was implied in our -- for the second half, and that equates to 5% for the full year.  So as we head into 2023, we will have carryover benefits from the pricing that we've achieved this year, including the second half initiatives. Our plan is to have a normally timed price increase. So we'll have an additional increase at the beginning of the year, and we'll share more details on that as we roll that out, but that will incorporate the conditions that we're seeing in terms of the value that we're adding and also inflationary impacts in the business. I think that we'll share more on that, obviously, as we get further along here. You're pointing out some positive factors that I think will be helpful for us heading into next year. I think the price realization is higher than we've achieved historically. We think it's appropriate in the current environment, and that will be a positive dynamic. And as Jay mentioned, we do think we'll work through some of the headwinds related to the capacity pullback that we saw this year. I think it's early for us to talk about the trajectory into next year, just given the macro backdrops. We'll gain more insight here and focus on what we can do, which is to execute well, and we think that will position us for continued solid growth, and we'll share more of those details as we complete our plans and give you an update on the year-end call. There are impacts from selling programs as well. I think we feel very good about the expansion of 360. We've seen very high attach rates of replacing ProCyte Ones. We're replacing Catalysts, and that's really the multiplier benefit that we've had to highlight and that gets folded into the 360-type agreement. So that's part of the dynamic as well. But largely, it's the factors that Jay was highlighting. The bulk of our growth is in international markets, and that's a meaningful driver of some of the relative revenue changes.  And -- but on balance, the overall growth in our base is very strong. Our EVI metrics were up at high levels. Consumable gains are strong. The instrument base expansion is a big driver of our execution growth benefit. So we feel really good about the instrument performance. Yeah. Thanks, Nate. We thought it was appropriate to maintain a similar outlook to what we had shared for the second half. I think we're very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. I think on the clinic visit growth trend side, I think that, that was a relatively favorable factor in Q3, but we're not -- that as kind of a longer-term trend. We think the trends that we've seen kind of in the last few months are appropriate kind of to plan off of, and our pricing execution is in line with our plans. So we thought the -- we really focus on the midpoint of the range. We think that's still an appropriate place to be. The lower end of the range is really reflective of potential macro risk that we think is appropriate to build in. And of course, the higher end would be if we can continue to execute well and see some improvement in the underlying visit trends. But I think the -- we think, on balance, it's a consistent outlook, and we think that's appropriate in the current environment. Thanks for your question, Ryan. Let me start with the Water business. The Water business is probably our highest recurring revenue business in terms of our customer relationships. It's very much embedded with the ongoing workflow for water safety testing, and we feel very good about the momentum in that business, as we reported 12% organic growth in the quarter.  And so I think the backdrop there is it's a strong global growth, good growth across regions. We have solid net price realization as well. And we highlighted an acquisition this quarter, which complements our product offering. And so we feel very good about the momentum in that business, building off the progress that we've made recently. LPD, as we reported, had positive growth, 7% in the quarter. We were -- have worked through the tough compares that we've been facing in recent quarters in China. And actually, we're up against really an easy compare last year in China. It was probably our toughest quarter in the year. So we've worked through that, and we saw a positive benefit from health screen as a driver. And overall, kind of modest growth, mode growth in our testing areas. I think it is an area that we're paying attention to in terms of macro backdrop. But I think we've worked through the tougher compares here and feel that we're positioned for positive growth moving forward."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX delivered strong results in the third quarter, as teams across the company continued excellent execution to advance our strategic priorities. Demand for Companion Animal health care remains high, building on stepped-up levels there in the pandemic supported by a continued focus on service within veterinary clinics. Veterinarians are looking for partners to support their growth while they provide high levels of care in an efficient manner.  These professionals continue to turn to IDEXX for the support in the third quarter. This was reflected in yet another quarter of record placements of premium capital instruments, strong momentum in PIMS placements its continued desire for cloud-native products, consistent new business gains and sustained high customer retention levels. These continued trends demonstrate that veterinarians appreciate IDEXX's integrated ecosystem, and the layers of innovation would support and improve each step of clinic workflows.  The result was expansion across IDEXX execution growth drivers, including relatively higher net price realization, which drove IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to significantly outpace clinical visit growth. This supported a solid same-store diagnostics revenue growth in the U.S. despite moderating impacts from reductions in clinic capacity levels this year. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in the quarter while delivering strong financial results. I'll begin with a review of recent trends in the companion animal sector. Third quarter CAG sector trends were supported by solid global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in pet ownership and patient visits during the pandemic. U.S. same-store diagnostics revenues grew 7% per practice during the third quarter, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and well above total same-store practice revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Services remain a key focus for veterinarians. And within services, diagnostics is a key component in providing valuable health care insights, supporting practice economics and driving revenue growth. Consistent with trends through this year, diagnostics revenue growth at the practice level continues to be driven by increases in both the frequency and utilization of diagnostics, resulting in 9.5% growth in diagnostics revenue per visit for the quarter, building on the strong gains seen through the pandemic. IDEXX grew overall U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 10% normalized despite recent clinic visit growth headwinds as we benefit from decades of focus and investment, which brings differentiated value to our customers. As Brian noted, IDEXX execution drivers contributed approximately 1,300 basis points to U.S. growth in Q3 on a normalized basis. This reflects benefits from continued expansion of our premium instrument installed base, adoption of IDEXX innovations, consistent business gains, record retention levels and increased price realization. On a multiyear basis, critical visit growth was healthy in the quarter with solid growth in both wellness and non-wellness visits. three-year CAGR wellness visit growth, in particular, was in line with historic trends of 2% to 3%, demonstrating that U.S. pet owners are continuing to prioritize pet health care. This trend continues to be supported by IDEXX's turnkey Preventive Care program, which included approximately 200 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter. This is the second quarter of year-over-year increased enrollments, showing that customers continue to appreciate the simple yet comprehensive testing and pet owner communication tools included in this program. This program is just one example of how we are engaging with our customers to support them through near-term challenges related to managing clinic capacity in meeting growing demand for health care services. We are building on our strong customer relationships to drive continued solid organic growth in our CAG business. With that, let's now turn to discuss IDEXX's strong progress against our key strategic growth initiatives. As mentioned, excellent execution across the IDEXX organization supported strong performance during a dynamic third quarter with commercial teams delivering the day while also building the foundation for long-term growth across regions. Record quarterly placements of premium instruments supported another quarter of double-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base.  Global premium instrument placements grew 10% in the quarter. and placements in new and competitive accounts grew even faster at 13%, supporting strong EVI gains across regions. These results, combined with continued sustained new business gains and 98% Catalyst customer retention rates, will support future recurring revenue growth aligned with the long-term financial framework shared at our recent Investor Day. Sustained high levels of commercial performance were aided in part by continued improvement in the rate of in-person visits for account managers, up to 75% in the U.S. and nearly 70% in Europe. IDEXX sales representatives are welcome in the clinic as trusted advisers to their customers, adding value by helping customers provide high standards of medical care, drive strong practice economics and improve practice efficiency. These results are also supported by our world-class innovative products like ProCyte One and customer-friendly marketing programs that help support the adoption of IDEXX Innovations. ProCyte One provides customers with an efficient lower-cost hematology platform at the point of care and is especially sought after in international regions where veterinarians have been trained to do hematology testing first when doing a basic workup on a patient. This platform is integral to our strategy to address the approximately 230,000 long-term global instrument placement opportunity that Dr. Tina Hunt shared at Investor Day, and third quarter results continue to be very encouraging. ProCyte One was a key driver of 26% growth in premium hematology placements in the quarter with international regions representing approximately 75% of ProCyte One placements and more than 60% of its installed base. Attach rates for ProCyte One are consistently high. Over 95% of ProCyte One customers overall and more than 80% of competitive customers also utilize our chemistry platform, demonstrating the excellent placement quality and strong multiplier benefit of this platform. These results are further supported by benefits from investments we have made to expand our global commercial organization, where we are seeing positive reach to revenue trends and deeper customer relationships. Customer survey work in Germany and France demonstrates that customers have had an overwhelmingly positive experience during the first year of the new commercial ecosystem.  Over 90% of customers in Germany, for example, indicate that their commercial experience is the same or better than a year ago with the highest satisfaction rates and practices to receive continuous commercial engagement. This feedback highlights the benefit of our high-touch commercial model, where diagnostic subject matter experts partner with practice centers and staff to drive practice patient care and business objectives. Our commercial and operational teams in the Asia-Pacific region are also driving successful execution against our strategic plans. Asia-Pacific premium instrument placements are at a record high and were delivered while hiring and onboarding new sales professionals in Japan and opening a new reference lab in Brisbane, Australia during the quarter. Concurrent seamless execution of our commercial investments across multiple regions is not easy to do and to do so while also delivering against our business goals. This demonstrates the value of the investments we've made in these teams, which will continue to benefit us as we work to address the significant long-term addressable opportunity outside the U.S. In addition to these excellent commercial results, we also delivered multiple new technologies to our customers during the quarter. Since VMX in January, we have announced eight new product service and software solution enhancements across IDEXX modalities, each of which add value to the relationship that customers have with IDEXX while demonstrating our commitment to a technology for life strategy. Five out of eight of these projects were launched in the third quarter. These are number one, expanding the comprehensiveness of our fecal antigen reference lab test by adding a flea tapeworm assay, which now detects up to 5 times more than traditional methods. Number two, providing faster access to PCR results for North American customers by opening a next day PCR lab in Louisville.  Number three, improved veterinary insight into the treatment of feline chronic kidney disease by adding an improved disease marker, FGF23, to our reference lab menu. Number four, improving the efficiency, convenience and sustainability of the Catalyst SDMA test by reformulating the test to include onboard reagents. And number five, delivering enhanced accuracy and longer room temperature storage in our best-in-class 4Dx Plus Test.  The rollout of these new products and services was enthusiastically received by our customers and highlighted the IDEXX team's ability to deliver high-quality new products, which will help increase standards of animal health care and develop our sector while also providing very high customer service levels. Another strategic area of innovation is IDEXX's software and diagnostic imaging businesses, which include a full suite of software product offerings to create a connected ecosystem within the clinic that supports each step clinic workflow through the patient appointment, the practice information management system and its easily updatable customer-friendly front-end interface is the center of this solution. Record third quarter PIMS placements highlight strong customer interest the whole product solution at IDEXX offers. Furthermore, the shift to cloud-based products that we highlighted at Investor Day continued in the quarter as over 90% of placements were cloud-based subscriptions, reflecting 50% growth in cloud-based placements compared to the prior year and demonstrating the value that last year's ezyVet acquisition continues to bring to the business. Strong results across this business in the quarter were not limited to PIMS products, diagnostic imaging systems placements, Web PACS subscriptions, PIMS application adoption like payment processing and VetConnect PLUS with clinical decision support, engaged with all advanced at healthy levels in the quarter. We know veterinarians are looking for ways to obtain, understand and communicate diagnostics insights in a digital and streamlined way, and our software portfolio is well positioned to provide them with these solutions. The benefits of these products and solutions to IDEXX and our customers are compelling. They have highly favorable economics given the recurring nature of the revenue stream and high incremental gross margins. They also drive customer engagement, which supports a high levels of retention since they improve our customers' productivity and overall experience. IDEXX's innovation agenda also extends beyond our Companion Animal business. We recently took the opportunity to advance our water business by acquiring Tecta Pathogen Detection System, with an automated microbiology detection platform that uses patented technology to automate the incubation, reading and results notification for E. Coli and total coliform testing and drinking water supplies. This application provides an automated data-enabled instrument in EPA-approved coliform testing solution that complements our core water solutions by providing value for customers operating under rushed conditions. We're excited to be able to invest in the attractive area of water testing and leverage our commercial resources to scale this new technology. This innovation agenda demonstrates a relentless focus on providing our customers with world-class products that increase in value over time. Products not only provide them with important insights but also help increase workflow efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to these top-notch products, our customer focus is supported by extremely high service levels to ensure customers have a wonderful experience with IDEXX, allowing us to earn their business every day. Our frontline supply chain and customer service teams continue to deliver high levels of service, reflected in another quarter of approximately 99% product availability despite ongoing challenges in the external environment. This strong performance leverages years of investment in our supply chain and customer support resources as we continue to deliver on the operational needs of our customers. That concludes our review. I'm proud to report another quarter of strong results as IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long run while also delivering on our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. Our performance reflects the commitment and talent of our IDEXX team.  On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank our more than 10,000 colleagues for the passion and engagement they bring to our purpose and strategy every day. You're making a meaningful difference to the health and well-being at pets, people and buy stock around the world.  So now we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Yeah, sure. Good morning, Chris. We expect we'll work through the impacts of the pullback in capacity this year in 2023. The overall clinic visit growth, as you indicated in the outlook, it still remains fairly dynamic. There's a lot of external factors like macro impacts, the labor supply dynamics that we've talked about and even potential impacts from further COVID outbreak. So we'll be monitoring those macro impacts as a pet owner behavior and really factor that into our outlook.  What I would point out is that our focus is on those things that we can control from an execution standpoint, both innovations and commercial engagement with our commercial teams. And we continue to do extremely well in being able to support customers with technology, whether it's PIMS systems, software, which help their productivity and support their efficiency. Clinic instrument placements -- in-clinic instrument placements were at record levels. I think that reflects at a basic level that there is a very positive outlook on the industry, and their willingness to invest, it really supports growth. We think that, from an overall dynamic standpoint, Europe is a little bit different. But in the U.S., capacity constraints are the primary factor affecting clinical visits versus end customer demand. In Europe, we're seeing some impacts from just the back row factors, and we'll see how that plays out and whether that continues going forward. Yeah. Just to add to that, the fit of our in-clinic instruments now with ProCyte One is outstanding for these international markets. We saw ProCyte One growth 26%, as I indicated in my comments. And so from a footprint, price, performance, connectivity, ease-of-use standpoint, it really fits us international markets very well.  The international customers, it depends based on country or region, but they tend to test hematology first. So it's a really important solution for these customers and has a big multiplier impact because very often when we sell ProCyte One, we also sell it with a chemistry analyzer and, in some cases, even a SediVue. So we feel very positive about solutions and our ability to help customers achieve their objectives. Certainly, there's a macro factors that we've talked about in the past, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the energy prices, and we'll just continue to monitor that and see how that plays out over time. Yeah, I would just add to that, that from a customer perspective, what customers are most interested in and the message we keep hearing back from them, is they want to make sure that from a product testing continuity standpoint, supply chain, how we support them that all those pieces are in place. And they realize that, given the current environment, it's a little bit more expensive to run the business, and they want us to invest in being able to support them. And we see that reflected in very high customer retention rates really globally across the world. We think that's an important input or input into the growth formula of the company. So that's an area we're going to continue to invest in. And as Brian indicated, we think our pricing approach on balance, very reasonable, given the current environment. I think what's -- just to add to Brian's comments, what's been very gratifying is the resonance and, I think, interest amongst our customers of our solutions. I talked about software. But our customers pretty much across the board are feeling pressures. There may be capacity pressures or and or staff pressures within their practices and trying to run a business, delivering excellent medical care but also sensitive to the economics and making sure they have a healthy business.  And they're looking to software solutions. So we see this with our PIMs solutions, cloud-based PIMS solutions and their enthusiasm around really upgrading software within their practices that help support workflow optimization, staff productivity, client communications, all the things that they've been looking for. So I think we have the right solutions at the right time given the market circumstances. We're seeing that in clinic pretty much across the board, across all the solutions.  And even at our Reference Lab, had really nice mouth, especially in the U.S. As we look -- we've expanded our menu. We've improved our service offerings in the case of PCR at Louisville, which is next day, if customers would like that. And they're using that as an extension of their own practice. So we're optimistic that, for those things that we can control, we'll do a good job and that customers are highly enthusiastic about these solutions. Yeah. Jon, on balance, I mean, on balance, there is some variability within any given quarter. But if you look at over a two-three year CAGR rate there, it's pretty -- it's what you would -- might expect. So I don't think there's anything specifically related to capacity. The capacity speaks to the length in getting an appointment. And with existing pet owners, most veterinarians aren't turning those folks away whether it's a wellness visit or a sick visit. So you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any dynamic related that piece of it. We know that people are going back to work, at least in a hybrid fashion. We haven't been able to pull out anything specifically related to return to work, whether it's two or three days a year. What we do see is capacity pullback, especially on weekends, has gone down somewhat over the year, and we think that just reflects practices or maybe short of staff and trying to balance their working environment better, better for their employees. But nothing specific that I think we can call out or point to. Yeah, Jon, it's primarily related to both geographic mix. We're selling more internationally and then product mix more ProCyte Ones, which have a lower AUP than the ProCyte Dx. So the ProCyte One grew 26%. It's a lower AUP. The international mix was higher. And so that -- I think that accounts for the 5% drop in revenue on a very, very strong placement rate. Yeah. One driver, we focus on from just the quality of instrument replacements is new and competitive Catalyst because that drives an outsized portion of the consumables revenue and the clinic business, and that was up 13%. And so that's a reflection of just, I think, the focus of our commercial organization and the importance of chemistry consumables to the business. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Nate. And good morning. Our customers, I think, see this -- see our pricing as reasonable given the current environment. They know it's more expensive for them to run their businesses. I think they see -- continue to see really good end customer demand within the clinics. And their focus is really on they want to make sure they get the support from a product continuity, testing results on time, the engagement that we provide with the customer technical support organization. So their primary focus is on that. Pricing -- the flip side of pricing is the value that we deliver, and we continue to deliver extremely high value. We've had eight product introductions or enhancements this year, just five in Q3 alone, really across the business in software, reference labs and our clinic businesses. And so that helps them from both the standpoint of delivering better patient care but also productivity and efficiency within the practice, and I appreciate that. And from the standpoint of their own -- they have the ability from an end customer pet owner pricing standpoint to increase prices. They've done that. I think diagnostics is a small piece of their overall cost envelope, but it drives the important health care services envelope for their practice. So they see this as a really core enabler to what they do. Yeah. Good morning. We have a multifaceted strategy to really support the efficiency. Within practices, I mentioned the portfolio piece, including software. And to answer a part of your question directly, practices are taking the time to implement new PIMS systems, specifically ezyVet. They see a really good return on that -- and they're enthusiastic about moving to the cloud-based systems and, in some cases, modifying or optimizing workflow if it helps them. Specifically around the questions around training, we have a number of different platforms to be able to support the training needs and knowledge needs, practices. Some of it is clinical, some of it is business and workflow optimization, both online and in person. We have a very significantly sized field service representative organization as well as professional service vets for more peer-to-peer that's both in person into our internal medicine group over the phone. We've seen nice growth in engagement and calls into IDEXX to help support them.  So there's lots of, I think, avenues open to customers for training and practice efficiency support. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We definitely are expanding Preventive Care beyond the U.S. We see a select number of markets and especially corporate accounts outside the U.S. very interested in preventive care. It's a little bit earlier stages from the standpoint of interest and adoption in some of our international country regions. But the same -- I think that's the same level of interest. It just may not be as much knowledge in terms of -- from a workflow standpoint and customer education work. That still needs to be done.  So we're making -- I think we're making progress. I would just say it's more embryonic and we think represents a solid long-term opportunity. Yeah. Good morning, Elliot. There are a couple of different, I think, questions you're getting at. So we saw, as you indicated, a negative 2.4% clinical visit decline in the quarter. And this was a modest sequential improvement compared to Q2. But we don't really see this as a fundamental change in the trend. We continue to expect near term impacts from reductions in capacity. And obviously, the macro environment remains dynamic. We are pleased, as we've talked about, the overall diagnostics revenue per practice visit. That's both a function of adoption as well as utilization. Those two pieces, I think, are performing extremely well through the first three quarters of this year relative to historical rates. And that's, I think, the reflection -- again, getting back to the execution drivers in the business, really driving commercial engagement and innovations, the type of things that I think customers want and that supports medical services within the practice and things that are important to really delivering exceptional patient care. And so with that, that will conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning. I know we have lots of IDEXX employees listening, and I'd like to say thank you for your continued commitment to our purpose and your focus and execution against our strategy. Your continued engagement in the midst of what we all know is dynamic external factors, I think, helped deliver another excellent quarter and excellent execution. So I'm thankful for all your work, and look forward to finishing 2022 on a strong note.  And so with that, we'll conclude the call. And again, thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, continued high levels of IDEXX execution drove solid organic revenue growth in Q2 compared to strong prior year results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 6.5% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics were excellent, reflected an 18% gains in premium instrument placements, continued strong double-digit growth in veterinary software and service revenues and a nearly 1,100 basis point U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to same-store clinical visit levels. For the first half of 2022, overall organic growth was 7.2%, slightly below our expectations for first half growth at the low end of our 7.5% to 10% full year guidance range. These results reflect relatively increased headwinds from lower year-on-year US clinical visit levels, increased macroeconomic impacts in international regions. Profit results were in line with our expectations, supported by sustained high gross margins. EPS was $1.56 per share in the quarter, including $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments and $0.06 of net year-on-year impact from the stronger US dollar. As planned, EPS results reflected high operating expense growth, including the impact of $80 million in discrete R&D investments in the quarter and carryover effects from prior commercial investments. As we look forward to the second half of 2022, we're targeting continued solid organic revenue growth, building on the significant expansion of IDEXX's business through the pandemic. We've updated our full year overall organic growth outlook to 5.5% to 8% for 2022, reflecting 6.5% to 9% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. The midpoint of this updated range reflects an outlook for continued solid organic gains in the second half, aided by strong IDEXX execution trends and benefits from incremental price increases. As we'll discuss, vet practices continue to work through capacity constraints and the lapping of high 2021 demand levels supported by the significant growth in new pets during the pandemic. Given these factors in a challenging global economic climate, our midpoint organic growth outlook incorporates expectations for continued pressure on clinical visit levels in the second half of 2022. At the low end of our updated growth range, we've also incorporated an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate in the second half related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. Our EPS outlook of $7.77 to $8.05 reflects our updated organic revenue growth estimates and new estimates for foreign exchange effects based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar. It also reflects expectations for sustained strong full year operating margins flat to 50 basis points below prior year levels, adjusting for foreign exchange effects and $80 million in discrete R&D costs in 2022. We'll walk through the details of our updated P&L outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 6.5% was supported by 7% organic gains in our CAG business and 9% organic growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 5% organic decline in the LPD revenues,, driven primarily by year-on-year impacts related to reduced African swine fever testing in China. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 7% organically in Q2, compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 5% growth in international regions. Q2 CAG gains were also supported by 8% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. In terms of US CAG sector demand drivers, sustained healthy trends supporting increased utilization of diagnostics were moderated by relatively increased year-on-year pressure on clinical visit growth. In Q2, same-store clinical visits were an estimated 3.1% below strong prior year levels. This compares to an updated estimate of 1.4% declines in Q1 and 2.5% to 3% increases in the second half of 2021. Our analysis points to two primary factors driving the recent change in US clinical visit growth trends, reduction in vet clinic capacity from peak pandemic levels and the continued lapping of the significant step-up in demand for pet health care during the pandemic, including benefits from the 10% increase in the pet population in 2020 and 2021. Historically, US clinical visits per practice have grown at approximately 2% to 3% annually, supported by steady vet practice capacity expansion. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, US average clinical visits per practice jumped nearly 13%, and these higher absolute visit levels sustained through 2021. Extraordinary efforts by vets and their staff during the pandemic supported the significant increase in demand for clinical services, including diagnostics. In 2022, US clinical visit capacity pulled back from these high levels, impacted by staffing challenges reflected in a 2% contraction in average clinical visit levels in the first half of 2022. This has brought implied vet clinic capacity metrics more in line with longer term expansion trends, while still being below the strong demand in the sector implied by the pet population expansion. We see these specific dynamics is improving over time. However, given the recent pullback in clinic capacity, which continues to be affected by near-term staffing challenges and the lapping of strong underlying demand levels throughout 2021, we believe it's appropriate to plan for continued year-on-year pressure on US clinic visit growth in the second half of this year. Offsetting these near-term growth headwinds is the continued expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit at the clinic level, supported by IDEXX innovation and engagement. While year-on-year clinical visits declined 3% on a same-store basis in Q2, diagnostics revenue per visit expanded nearly 9%, consistent with strong Q1 trends. IDEXX' US CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 7.6% in Q2, continues to outpace solid sector growth trends reflected in the 1,070 basis point premium to clinical visit gains. Jay will talk more about how we're driving sustained strong performance on this front in his comments. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting solid gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 15% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 18% in Q2, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 25% growth internationally, as clinics showed continued confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 9% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supported by our global expansion efforts reflected in a 64% year-on-year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Rapid assay revenues expanded solidly in Q2 compared to higher prior year demand levels. Global rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically supported by solid volume gains in the US and benefits from net price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 6%, organically in Q2 as high single-digit growth in the US was moderated by flat organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same-store clinic visit growth in Europe, including increased macroeconomic impacts. Reference Lab, new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally. We achieved continued solid net price gains in the quarter globally with an average 4% growth benefit to US and worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the first half. Our updated outlook includes benefits from additional US CAG price increases implemented in August ,reflecting product and service enhancements and inflationary impacts. We estimate incremental price changes will provide an additional 1.5% to 2% and growth benefit to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2022. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically and 27% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting strong performance across regions, including benefits from net price improvements. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 5% organically in Q2. Tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We've now worked through these comparison impacts and are targeting positive growth in LPD in the second half of this year. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 5% in the quarter as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.7% in line with high prior year levels on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives and improvement in software service gross margins helped to offset inflationary effects and impacts from lower LPD revenues. Operating expenses increased 46% year-on-year as reported in the second quarter and 48% on a comparable basis, including a 35% OpEx growth impact related to $80 million in discrete R&D investments. Operating expense increases reflect carryover impacts from investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We're planning for moderated operating expense growth in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter as we gain leverage from these investments and lap more favorable year-on-year comparisons. EPS was $1.56 per share, a decrease of 30% on a comparable basis including a 32% growth impact related to the discrete R&D investment. EPS results included tax benefits of $3 million or $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation, which was down $0.04 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $6 million and EPS by $0.06 per share in Q2, net of $6 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $36 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 66%. For the full year, we continue to estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets. We're maintaining our full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing warehouse expansion project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash. We allocated $340 million of capital to repurchase 809,000 [ph] shares in Q2. We intend to continue to support our share repurchase program and leverage our strong balance sheet as appropriate on this round. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with the consistent net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 2% full year reduction in share count. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're lowering our full year organic revenue growth range by 2% to reflect first half performance, recent care sector trends and to incorporate potential additional impacts from macroeconomic factors at the lower end of our guidance range. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the recent strengthening of the US dollar and updating our EPS outlook to incorporate current expectations for foreign exchange impacts and projected changes in interest rates. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.305 billion to $3.385 billion, reflects an $80 million to $85 million reduction compared to earlier estimates. This includes a $20 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3% to 3.5% for the full year with approximately 4.5% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q3. As noted, we've updated the full year organic revenue growth outlook to 5.5% to 8%. This reflects a full year CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 6.5% to 9%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies second half organic gains of 5% to 10%. The midpoint of our outlook for H2 reflects CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 7.5% or 8% normalized for equivalent days effects, which we estimate will reduce Q3 revenue growth by approximately 1%. Supporting this outlook are benefits from price increases were advancing in the second half of 2022, which we estimate will provide 1.5% to 2% of additional benefit to worldwide H2 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth building on first half gains of approximately 4%. Net of this incremental price benefit, the midpoint growth outlook for the second half of 2022 is consistent with the global sector growth trends exiting Q2 and reflects expectations for sustained high IDEXX CAG growth premiums supported by continued strong IDEXX commercial execution. The lower end of our second half growth outlook factors in an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. A 5% second half growth rate for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues would align with the low end of growth impact seen in the last recessionary period. The higher end of our growth outlook for the second half targets improved 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth supported by strong IDEXX execution and price increase benefits but will require an improvement in recent clinical visit growth trends. At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for full year operating margins of 26.4% to 26.9%, an adjustment of approximately 50 basis points from our last outlook. This reflects a projected 210 to 260 basis point decrease on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to discrete R&D investments. Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments, and approximately 20 basis points of year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, the high end of this outlook reflects updated goals for relatively flat operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. The full year operating margin outlook is supported the goals to deliver solid comparable operating margin gains in H2. We're targeting flat to modest comparable operating margin increases in Q3 and higher levels of improvement in Q4 as we benefit from higher net price realization, cost management efforts and the lapping of prior year stepped up investment levels. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.77 to $8.05 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of $0.32 per share at midpoint, including $0.05 of impact from higher projected interest rates and $0.03 of additional headwind related to FX. For the full year at our midpoint outlook, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by $23 million and EPS by $0.21 per share. This is net of an estimated $26 million or $0.23 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered another quarter of solid growth, supported by excellent execution by our global IDEXX teams. Demand for pet health care remains high, building on the step function and sector growth of pets and patient visits during the pandemic. IDEXX is a diagnostics and software partner of choice of veterinary clinicians. This was reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued high growth in cloud-based PIMS placements in a sustained IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to clinical visit growth. Our products support veterinarians by creating an integrated clinic-wide solution that helps them expand capacity and grow their businesses, while providing diagnostic insights to support high levels of pet health care. The solid results that IDEXX delivered in the quarter despite some headwinds from near-term clinical visit growth and international macro factors reinforce our confidence in the durability and long-term growth potential of our business, aligned with increasing care standards for companion animals. Today, I'll discuss our performance and progress in the context of current sector trends in advancing key innovation and commercial initiatives that position us for continued solid growth and financial performance. Let me start by providing some updated context on trends in the companion animal sector. CAG sector trends continue to reflect strong global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in the number of pets and patient visits observed during the pandemic. US diagnostics revenue per practice grew 6% during the second quarter, against a very strong prior year base, as veterinarians use diagnostics to deliver best care standards, while benefiting from profitable clinical services growth. IDEXX grew US CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue nearly 8%, two points faster, validating the value we bring with differentiated solutions and an excellent customer experience. Specifically, diagnostics remains one of the faster growing areas of the veterinary clinic continuing to outpace both total practice revenue growth and clinical revenue growth on a same-store basis. US diagnostics revenue growth per practice of 6% in the quarter, as noted was once again driven by positive contribution from both diagnostic frequency and utilization. Diagnostics frequency and the utilization gains were both above pre-pandemic trends even at a much higher base. As highlighted in the earnings snapshot, critical use of diagnostics per visit expanded by revenue nearly 9% in the quarter, offsetting headwinds from lower clinical visits. We continue to make progress on initiatives that drive future diagnostics recurring revenue. We saw increased adoption of our US preventive care program where we provide a turnkey diagnostic solution to wellness care, with approximately 225 new enrollments, the largest quarter of enrollment since late 2020. We're also seeing continued momentum across global regions related to the adoption of IDEXX platforms, reflected in 25% growth in international premium instrument placements, including the successful expansion of our ProCyte One platform. These strong areas of progress have been moderated by year-on-year pressure on clinical visit trends. This reflects a combination of impacts from pullback and capacity levels following a period of significant demand expansion, including the step-up in visits related to the 10% expansion of the pet population during the pandemic. In the US, for example, clinics were open around 50% of weekend days in Q2, compared to an average of almost 60% pre-pandemic. We're also seeing some impacts from macroeconomic pressures, particularly in Europe. We think it's prudent to plan on continued year-on-year growth impacts on these fronts in the second half of 2022. Recent research we performed in the US and Germany, shows that a majority of veterinarians indicate staff capacity is a major or moderate issue, while also indicating they see continued higher demand for appointments. As Brian indicated, we are well-positioned with clinics in working through these dynamics over time to address what is likely underserved demand for pet health care in a significantly expanded global pet population. As we work through these near-term headwinds, we're targeting solid organic growth overall in the second half, building momentum that will keep us on track towards our long-term growth goals. Let's now discuss our ongoing progress in key areas of our growth strategy. A key factor in enabling IDEXX to drive strong utilization of diagnostics within the sector, IDEXX\u2019s decade-long focus on building and supporting a world-class commercial team to execute our high-touch model. These capabilities, along with significant new product introductions over the last several years, help our customers grow faster and continue to support strong commercial results. This is reflected in record instrument and software placements, strong EVI games, sustained solid net new business gains in very high customer retention levels. These results demonstrate the market development benefits appearing commercial capabilities with highly relevant innovative products. Our sales professionals have shown an ability to maintain and leverage the deep relationships with customers to support these performance levels despite challenges related to staff capacity, US account manager in-person visits are now over 70% approaching desired end state goals. International access was also excellent at close to 70%, where international growth is a strategic priority, and we're applying the successful US playbook to drive strong placements and new business gains. The second quarter represented continued progress against the strategy with solid year-over-year growth in customer adoption across modalities in Europe. Meanwhile, onboarding and integration of the six country-level commercial expansions have been completed and have gone extremely well. We look forward to ongoing future benefits from these expansions as we work through macro-driven headwinds in regions like Europe, which are constraining near-term organic gains. The international opportunity to drive diagnostics utilization is tremendous, and largely underpenetrated as shared in last year's Investor Day, our advancing global commercial capability and product innovations that fit the requirements of these regions are positioning us to realize significant opportunities over long horizons. Putting the right products and enhance of our capable sales professionals drives continued growth in instrument placements with the resulting highly profitable future consumable streams. Customers on a global basis have never been hungrier for technology that supports care, workflow optimization, excellent clinical performance and friction for use. A key piece of our in-house analyzer portfolio is ProCyte One, the innovative customer-friendly hematology analyzer, which launched last year and has already surpassed an installed base of over 5,000 units. Reception and adoption of ProCyte One has been exceptional, particularly in international regions where many veterinarians were trained to run hematology diagnostics first when doing a basic workup on a patient. We had excellent growth in ProCyte One placements across regions for the second quarter and continued high levels of customer satisfaction and retention, supporting the expansion of our global premium hematology installed base aligned to the approximately 4,000 placements annually as shared in last year's Investor Day. This progress is integral in addressing the estimated opportunity for 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placements. In addition to these targeted investments in enhanced commercial capabilities, technology and product innovation is another key pillar of IDEXX's growth strategy as we endeavor to add value to our product and service offerings. In Q2, we announced three upcoming laboratory tests and service launches. We have a shared mission with our customers to deliver a higher standard of pet health care. And these new products and services support that care delivery to timely and highly accurate diagnostic insights. These innovations also enable our customers to do so in an efficient way by using the IDEXX reference lab as an extension of the veterinarian clinic, which is a key benefit given the current capacity constraints within our sector. These innovations include; number one, expanding Fecal Dx antigen testing to include the detection of fleet taper, the most common type of taper to infect dogs and cats. With this addition, IDEXX's Fecal Dx antigen test detects up to five times more common and prevalent parasites that fecal flotation alone and provides customers with earlier diagnostic insights. This will drive even greater progress towards the goal we shared at Investor Day in 2018 of an incremental $120 million in fecal antigen revenues by 2023. Number two, the addition of FGF-23, a kidney disease management biomarker that will provide clinicians, along with the use of SDMA, not only earlier diagnostic signs of chronic kidney disease but will deliver more confident recommendations for targeted therapy during earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. And number three, a new service of PCR direct testing, which reference US reference lab customers with crucial, timely access to next APCR results, enabled by a new PCR laboratory at our Louisville reference site. The addition of these tests and services support our customers in delivering improved pet health care in ways in which an IDEXX partnership adds long-term increasing value for our customers. In addition to the development of highly relevant, accurately testing products, IDEXX's innovation focus is also on our broad portfolio of software services, including multiple cloud-native PIMs and a variety of tools to manage clinic workflow like Vet Radar, VetConnect PLUS, payment processing solutions and Web PACS. When combined, these products could create a powerful connected ecosystem within the veterinary clinic, which not only improves access to and communication of diagnostic insights but also provides efficiency benefits around the clinic and at each step of the patient visit process. The rapid uptake of IDEXX cloud-based solutions is a reflection of this. Customers understand that modern software tools reduce manual work and increased capacity for clinic staff to focus on higher order patient center tasks. This higher standard of care is further supported by clinical decision support on VetConnect PLUS, which leverages machine learning to offer suggested next steps aligned with care protocols. A great example of this is our enhanced 4Dx Plus introduction, where we not only improved upon our gold standard in a plasma assay, but added a vector-borne disease, clinical decision support module and made significant enhancements to workflow by doubling product shelf life and room temperature storage. We are also seeing incremental follow-up tests for customers engaging with clinical decision support, and we'll share with you at the upcoming Investor Day promising early results. Customers clearly appreciate these benefits as we saw another quarter of record PIMS global placements, supported by continued strong demand for cloud-based offerings. ezyVet in particular, continues to experience strong growth since joining the IDEXX software family. The second quarter placements consistent with the prior quarter and 28% higher than the previous year. These cloud-based solutions enable customers to shift their focus for maintaining on-premise hardware to providing excellent patient care while also benefiting IDEXX through growth of a highly profitable recurring revenue stream in the future. We continue to be very pleased with the advancement of our long-term strategy to integrate diagnostics and software that help IDEXX customers grow faster. Underpinning our growing commercial and technology capabilities is a commitment to providing world-class level of service to our customers, which is integral to earning our customers' business every day, especially given the high levels of demand within the sector. Strong execution against this commitment takes many forms, from consistently high product availability rates to reliable turnaround times at our reference labs. The high service level IDEXX delivered in the second quarter, including greater than 99% product availability demonstrates the benefit of our long-term focus on building supply chain capabilities and highly-scaled manufacturing centers. Our recently communicated US mid-year price increase reflects higher cost to run the business including investments in our supply chain to ensure excellent levels of product continuity and future network resiliency. Given this, IDEXX is well positioned to manage through supply chain and inflationary dynamics, while building on our strong long-term financial performance. This concludes our review. IDEXX's execution levels remain strong and aligned towards our significant and enduring long-term growth potential. We're well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results as we advance our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. I'm thankful there are more than 10,000 colleagues for their ongoing dedication to our efforts. They are integral in delivering strong financial performance for the company and creating long-term value, while also supporting the advancement of animal care globally. To those listening in on the call, I'd like to extend the heartfelt thanks in making a meaningful difference in the world. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that my senior management team and I will provide more information on the IDEXX strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day. After two years of holding the event virtually, we look forward to hosting the event at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 11, from 8:00 to noon. We're also live streaming and recording the event via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and GM for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Julie Godon, Vice President and GM for Global Rapid Assay; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President and GM of Veterinary Software and Services; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also excited to host a live customer conversation led by George Fennell, Senior Vice President and GM of Americas CAG Customer Facing Organization to discuss recent the trends at the clinic level and how IDEXX has supported their business during these pandemic times. The event will last approximately four hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session and an investor lunch with the extended management team. So with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: [indiscernible]?\nOperator: You're addressing from the mic. We cannot hear you.\nMichael Ryskin: Is that better? Hello?\nOperator: Here we go. Thank you.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. I want to ask on the pricing side of things first, just because we've got a lot of questions on that. Am I understanding correctly that the incremental price you're taking is that you called out in August, the 1.5% to 2%. That's on top of the 4% you took in the first half. And then just sort of how much price do you think you can take until you start seeing a little bit of a pushback. Is this some price you're pulling forward from 2023 in a sense? Just wondering the dynamics there, especially as you talk about weak macro and just uncertain conditions elsewhere?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for the question, Mike. Just on the first part, that's correct. So we had approximately a 4% increase in the US and worldwide in the first half and the 1.5% to 2%, we anticipate it will be an incremental worldwide benefits, so that would imply 5.5% to 6% for the second half. I'll let Jay talk to the customer dimension.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So qualitatively, as Brian indicated, the price increase was really, I think, a reflection of higher costs of running the business. And to your question around pet owner pushback, we don't think that, that's been a driver to date. In fact, pet owners have traditionally prioritized pet health care spend relative to other things. It's a small percentage of total consumable consumer expenditures. So it's a relatively small piece. And we know the human pet owner demand has been strong and growing, and we don't expect that to change.\nMichael Ryskin: And can I ask a follow-up on the vet visit growth you talked about. Obviously, we're all tracking a lot of the same indicators, and we're seeing how 2Q came in relative to the first quarter. You talked about all the gains in terms of capacity for vet visits in 2020 and 2021. After -- first of all, what's your assumption for vet visit for the rest of the year? If I'm backing into the numbers correctly, you're assuming gradual improvement from 2Q but still sort of like negative for the second half of the year. I want to make sure that's correct? And then at the end of this year, are we normalized then for the gains we made in 2021, or is there more headwinds in 2023? Is there -- are we back to a normal level and then can grow next year off of this in terms of vet visits, or is there still some more digesting of this capacity next year? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: So Mike, why don't I walk you through kind of how we're thinking about the outlook analytically and can try to link that back to the underlying sector trends. But just as a grounding, in Q2, the clinical visits year-on-year were down 3%. The revenue per clinical visit was very strong. It was up 8.5%, and that's very positive indicator we think we can build on. But I think the clinical visit levels, as you pointed out, were down relatively to Q1. And we're, I would say, modestly softer than that at the end of the quarter. So as we looked at the midpoint for the second half, if you take the 7.5% midpoint on CAG Dx recurring, there's a days headwind of 1% in Q3. So if we normalize for that, that's 8%. And then if you back off the 1.5% to 2% incremental pricing, it comes up to 6% to 6.5%. So we're basically forecasting that the underlying trends in the sector coming out of Q2 are similar in the second half and that we get incremental benefit from pricing. And the underlying assumptions there are that we're still working through the pullback in capacity that occurred with Fed plans earlier this year. As I mentioned in my comments, there was a big step up from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, 13%, that's sustained throughout 2021. And then we saw about a 2% pullback in the average visit level in the first half of the year. So that is something that given just ongoing staffing challenges, we think we're still going to be working through that this year. And we're still working through the very strong demand compares to the step-up last year, including the benefits from the pet population expansion. So -- to the latter part of your question, we do think we'll be working through those headwinds through this year, and those should improve, those specific factors should improve as we head into 2023, but we're trying to be realistic on kind of just the near-term trends and the headwinds given the dynamics that we continue to see through Q2, and we think that's prudently reflected in our outlook.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. The other thing I would add to that, Mike, is if you take a look at the net expansion in the number of pets visits in the pandemic. I mean there's -- I think there's some evidence that there's a potential underserved demand given this 10% growth. If you take a look at just extrapolate out the 2% to 3% clinical visit trend. We saw pre-pandemic and add in the number of pets, the clinical visits should be higher just based on pet population. So I think as profession works through some of the capacity constraints that we've talked about, I think the -- we'll see a recovery from there.\nOperator: We have our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much. I was just trying to get a little bit of clarification on the guidance change as returning dissects, I guess this vet visit growth dynamic versus some of the softening demand you referenced in Europe. So can you just maybe quantify how much of the, I guess, 200 basis point or so change in organic guidance is from those two factors? And maybe just on elaborating on the macroeconomic side, where are you seeing the greatest impacts here? Is this kind of broadly across Europe, or are you seeing specific markets that are seeing greater pressures than elsewhere? Thanks so much.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. The adjustment that we made is principally to reflect the more recent trends we're seeing both in the US and in Europe, principally around the visit trends. I think our execution levels have remained quite strong. We feel good about that. I think the underlying revenue per visit utilization dynamics, as you can see in the metrics are holding up well. And we think we can build on that. But the adjustment is principally to reflect the more recent trends, which were more aligned with the lower end of the outlook. Going back to our earlier guidance, we had talked about the lower end reflecting that some of the pressures continue, and that's what we've -- on visits, and that's what we've seen through the second quarter, and we think we're adjusting for that appropriately. I think we're reflecting in the full range that there's some opportunity for improvement in the second half. I think that to Jay's point, I think there's underlying demand that we believe is out there. And that the clinics can adapt and improve the capacity dynamics, I think that could be a positive factor. And of course, we're trying to highlight that there's some potential for additional macro risk that's more difficult to calibrate, but I think we're cognizant that, that could be a factor as well. So on balance, I think we think we're appropriately adjusting the outlook and reflecting the more recent trends.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Let me just maybe directly address your question around geographic balance. So we've done a number of different surveys, both in the US and Germany is our largest country in Europe. And what we're seeing is the majority of veterinarians indicate that stack capacity is a major or moderate issue. Not to say the macro effects, especially in Europe, we're seeing some impact from that primarily more so on the reference labs than in-clinic testing. And not surprising when you consider some of the factors that our European sector and regions are dealing with in terms of inflation and energy and the Ukraine-Russian war is much closer to them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. Another question on the macro. If I heard you correctly here, I guess, you mentioned that the lower end of the guidance embeds a growth expectation similar to what you experienced during the prior economic downturns here. But what the difference across your business now versus, for instance, 2008, 2009 that would make you I guess, more or less insulated from a more challenging economic backdrop here. And as I think about what was going on during that time, for instance, the Catalyst Dx launch, those initiatives may be leaving you differently positioned than maybe you would going into a tougher economic backdrop, particularly here in the US? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning. Erin, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're in a much stronger position than we were back in 2008, 2009 on a couple of, I think, very important dimensions. Our sales channel, we worked through distributors over a decade ago. And now we have a direct presence in 99% plus from a revenue standpoint. So we have those direct relationships with customers, our portfolio from an innovation standpoint is much more robust across the board, both reference labs, in-clinic software, for example. So I think we offer veterinarians a lot more tools and technology to help manage their practices. I think if anything, that had on our pet bond has grown and is stronger than it was a decade ago. And I think the industry itself, the profession itself is more sophisticated in managing through cycles. I think they're they have adopted a number of, I think, business practices, whether it's individual practices or the corporately owned practices in terms of managing care. So I think we're overall in a much stronger position than we were.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. Thanks. And then can you give us an update on innovation, and I'm sure we'll hear about this at the Investor Day. But how do you think about the recent discrete R&D investments that you made as well as the innovation that you called out in your prepared remarks here? And when will these efforts generate material contributions for you? And will this ultimately help bridge the gap between the macro capacity headwinds that you could see and continue to see in your historical long-term growth rates? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So from an innovation standpoint, I think we've never been more productive. If you look out over the last couple of years and the type of innovations really across the board from instrumentation, testing, services, software. So if you take a look at the instrumentation piece, ProCyte One has just been an incredible success our customers, I think, have responded exceptionally well to it. They love the fact that it's very easy to use. The performance is very high, and it's priced from an economic standpoint, in the sweet spot of the marketplace. So we've seen really dramatic uptake in our international regions, which is not surprising. A lot of those countries or regions are hematology first marketplaces. And the nice thing about hematology is it's hard to do. It's really hard to do well, and there's a multiplier impact. Typically, we sell with chemistry increasingly with SediVue, as part of in-clinic suites. And then on the software front, I think we're all familiar with the challenges that practices are facing from a workflow and staff productivity and client communication standpoint. So I think practices, which have traditionally relied on on-premise software solutions are looking at contemporary cloud-based solutions as a way to address some of those challenges, and we've seen really rapid uptake in our cloud-based PIMS portfolio, whether it's ezyVet or deal or Anima [ph] in some of our country and regions internationally. From a testing standpoint, we continue to -- as I mentioned in my remarks for reference labs, we've had a number of important introductions over the last couple of months and especially in fecal antigen with flea tapeworms expanding the portfolio for that. It's a fast-growing, I think very important franchise that we have, takes five times -- is up to five times as much compared to flotation or O&P. So it's an important part of the overall reference labs because customers, when they use preventive care panels, it fecals a piece of it, but an important piece of it. So a lot of the I think testing is either anchored or driven by the need for fecal. So overall, we're very excited. We're excited by the in-licensing agreements that we struck and we'll continue to provide updates on that over time, including at Investor Day. So look forward to being able to talk more about that.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Both questions might be centered around price in some way. But when I think about the Dx recurring growth price, for 2022, it looks like it's shaking out around 300 bps. So in other words, the 8% CAG, the ex-recurring midpoint guidance, less roughly 500 basis points of full year price, Brian, if I've got that correct. And historically, you've been closer to 1,000 bps, give or take. You've been growing CAG Dx recurring around 12%. And price was closer to 200 to 300 bps. So maybe some color on that compression of, call it, growth ex-price. Is there anything to call out other than comps, such as less incremental contribution from innovation or maybe what you're even seeing from a market share perspective for that rate of compression?\nBrian McKeon: Jon, I am trying to follow your math, but I think that we're not signaling a fundamental compression in the underlying kind of growth in excess of kind of visit levels, excluding kind of price changes. I think we've got a benefit this year. We're roughly 1,100 basis point premium in the US in the first half with 4% pricing that would imply kind of closer to the higher end of that 900 to 1,000 basis point range that we saw pre-pandemic. And our outlook for the year underlying it, we're not specifically forecasting clinical visit growth, but it's more of the trends that we saw coming out of Q2 would imply consistently high levels, and we're not trying to signal compression on that front. So I think we're -- that's something that we need to continue to execute well against. I think that can be impacted by consumer factors at the margin. So I don't want to say that those are things that we're not considering, but I think our midpoint outlook signals that we think we can continue to deliver well on that front and get some additional benefit from some pricing and that will support our solid full year numbers and second half numbers.\nJon Block: Okay. And maybe just to clarify, Brian, and it might be the same answer, then we can move on. But I'm not talking about, I guess, maybe -- I'm not talking about the premium to underlying clinical visits. I'm just looking at your CAG Dx recurring midpoints around 8% growth, you've got a 500 basis point contribution from price. So CAG Dx ex-price is around 300 basis points. And previously, it had been 900 basis points or 1,000, right? Your CAG Dx is growing 12%, your price was 200 to 300 basis points. So why if we normalize for the contribution from price and we throw that out, the growth just looks like a fraction this year versus prior years. And I'm guessing some of that's attributable to the comps is sort of where I'm going with it. But are there other components to it where you're getting less of an incremental contribution from innovation or less market share gains. That's where I was going with it just to clarify. And again, it might be the same answer we can move on, but hopefully, that was a better question, if you would.\nBrian McKeon: Yeah. And Jon, it's principally the swing in the clinical visit growth. I mean, we're growing 3% and declining 3% in Q3. So that's 600 basis points. I mean, I think our underlying execution and delivery has been quite good. And -- but -- and the swing in that is, as we mentioned, two factors. It's the pullback in the clinic capacity after a significant period of expansion and retroactive clinics couldn't sustain. And I think we believe can adapt to that over time. And I think that we've got -- we are lapping some of the step-up in the -- the big step-up in demand we saw in the pandemic, including the benefits from the patient expansion. So I think for 2022, that's kind of the key factor that we've been working through. That's the key adjustment in our full year outlook this year. We, obviously, had to make some changes. And this is the change in trend from the second half of 2021, but that's change in the visit level is the clinical visit growth levels is the key difference in terms of where we.\nJon Block: That's helpful. I've got -- yeah, I've got that swinging 400 bps plus two to minus two and ex-price compressing 600 to 700 bps, but it gets me a lot closer, and I could follow up offline. So that's why I was asking about market share innovation. Maybe just to shift gears and the second question is still in and around price. I'm just curious, Brian, is it uniform across all your CAG modalities in terms of consumables, lab, rapids. And more importantly, are your competitors following on price for both the point of care and reference lab? And if they're not, what does that say, if anything, about your ability to take the same rate of price increase, the same magnitude into 2023? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Jon, this was across consumables and reference not capital, and it was a -- primarily a US driven change.\nJon Block: Sorry, Jay. Point of -- I didn't ask capital. Point of care in the reference labs across all your modalities of CAG Dx recurring and have your competitors followed suit the best of your knowledge? And if not, what does it say about your ability to take price in?\nJay Mazelsky: We don't have any insight in terms of what competitors or competitive landscape is up to.\nBrian McKeon: It is reflective of the overall inflationary environment. So I think that that's a broader factor that I think everyone in the industry is dealing with.\nJon Block: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.\nElliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. I understand the granularity on ex US visit trends is a little bit more difficult to attain. But just wondering if you could comment in general, whether or not seeing the same level of deceleration in clinic visit trends ex-US versus US? Any perspective on that? And then more specifically on the performance or relative performance US versus ex US in the reference lab business, differential in growth rate is this purely just a function of difference in clinic visit trends, or are there other factors that continue to lead to the substantial over performance in the US versus international such as price and utilization? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, to your point, to your question, visibility internationally. So we don't have the same size PIMS installed base across the different regions. So we don't have that type of pinpoint accuracy we do in North America. I would say that we're seeing similar trends based on other data. I think it's a reflection of some of the same capacity, challenges in the practices because we know during the pandemic, we saw the same pet boom in countries like the UK, Germany, Australia, what have you. I think the overall factor we see internationally, specifically in Europe is we do see some of the macro impacts that does impact reference labs more so than point-of-care, not surprisingly, there's not as big a wellness or preventive care business internationally, but there -- it's probably 20% or so of the visits, and that's primarily a reference lab modality. So we do see some headwinds connected to that.\nOperator: We have our last question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.\nRyan Daniels: Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. I want to take a little bit of a different approach and get any insights you have on what type of IT investments you can make in the near or intermediate term to help your customers increase capacity. So I'm thinking things like digital intake platforms or self-service billing, et cetera. Is that a high priority for you? And do you think that's something that can actually help with throughput for your customers and alleviate some of this pressure?\nJay Mazelsky: Good morning, Ryan. We see pretty much across the board, whether it's independent practices or corporate practices, an incredible hunger for those type of IT tools, not just systems, but PIM systems, which provide the pinner-engagement modules, which allow them for \u2013 yes, if you take a step back, about 15%, what practice owners tell us, about 15% of their staff time is focused on just that patient intake piece and administration of the patient. And a lot of that can be automated. A lot of that could be done virtually like it's done in other industries. So the ability to use and deploy these software tools for client communications, for workflow optimization and every step of the patient visit is a high priority for these practices. And I mean -- and we're seeing that in our software business, where we've seen very rapid growth. And I think historically, practices have been somewhat hesitant to move away from PIM systems because the data and they've been trained on it and they have all the reports on it, but they're willing to make that switch now because they see the benefits of what a modern software suite can bring. So I think that's a -- that's only going to get stronger over time as work to address some of the capacity challenges.\nBrian McKeon: Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to IDEXX employees listening, I'd like to just say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose on wavering, engagement, enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite the unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. Thankful for your excellent effort and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of 2022. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, continued high levels of IDEXX execution drove solid organic revenue growth in Q2 compared to strong prior year results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 6.5% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics were excellent, reflected an 18% gains in premium instrument placements, continued strong double-digit growth in veterinary software and service revenues and a nearly 1,100 basis point U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to same-store clinical visit levels. For the first half of 2022, overall organic growth was 7.2%, slightly below our expectations for first half growth at the low end of our 7.5% to 10% full year guidance range. These results reflect relatively increased headwinds from lower year-on-year US clinical visit levels, increased macroeconomic impacts in international regions. Profit results were in line with our expectations, supported by sustained high gross margins. EPS was $1.56 per share in the quarter, including $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments and $0.06 of net year-on-year impact from the stronger US dollar. As planned, EPS results reflected high operating expense growth, including the impact of $80 million in discrete R&D investments in the quarter and carryover effects from prior commercial investments. As we look forward to the second half of 2022, we're targeting continued solid organic revenue growth, building on the significant expansion of IDEXX's business through the pandemic. We've updated our full year overall organic growth outlook to 5.5% to 8% for 2022, reflecting 6.5% to 9% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. The midpoint of this updated range reflects an outlook for continued solid organic gains in the second half, aided by strong IDEXX execution trends and benefits from incremental price increases. As we'll discuss, vet practices continue to work through capacity constraints and the lapping of high 2021 demand levels supported by the significant growth in new pets during the pandemic. Given these factors in a challenging global economic climate, our midpoint organic growth outlook incorporates expectations for continued pressure on clinical visit levels in the second half of 2022. At the low end of our updated growth range, we've also incorporated an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate in the second half related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. Our EPS outlook of $7.77 to $8.05 reflects our updated organic revenue growth estimates and new estimates for foreign exchange effects based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar. It also reflects expectations for sustained strong full year operating margins flat to 50 basis points below prior year levels, adjusting for foreign exchange effects and $80 million in discrete R&D costs in 2022. We'll walk through the details of our updated P&L outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 6.5% was supported by 7% organic gains in our CAG business and 9% organic growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 5% organic decline in the LPD revenues,, driven primarily by year-on-year impacts related to reduced African swine fever testing in China. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 7% organically in Q2, compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 5% growth in international regions. Q2 CAG gains were also supported by 8% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. In terms of US CAG sector demand drivers, sustained healthy trends supporting increased utilization of diagnostics were moderated by relatively increased year-on-year pressure on clinical visit growth. In Q2, same-store clinical visits were an estimated 3.1% below strong prior year levels. This compares to an updated estimate of 1.4% declines in Q1 and 2.5% to 3% increases in the second half of 2021. Our analysis points to two primary factors driving the recent change in US clinical visit growth trends, reduction in vet clinic capacity from peak pandemic levels and the continued lapping of the significant step-up in demand for pet health care during the pandemic, including benefits from the 10% increase in the pet population in 2020 and 2021. Historically, US clinical visits per practice have grown at approximately 2% to 3% annually, supported by steady vet practice capacity expansion. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, US average clinical visits per practice jumped nearly 13%, and these higher absolute visit levels sustained through 2021. Extraordinary efforts by vets and their staff during the pandemic supported the significant increase in demand for clinical services, including diagnostics. In 2022, US clinical visit capacity pulled back from these high levels, impacted by staffing challenges reflected in a 2% contraction in average clinical visit levels in the first half of 2022. This has brought implied vet clinic capacity metrics more in line with longer term expansion trends, while still being below the strong demand in the sector implied by the pet population expansion. We see these specific dynamics is improving over time. However, given the recent pullback in clinic capacity, which continues to be affected by near-term staffing challenges and the lapping of strong underlying demand levels throughout 2021, we believe it's appropriate to plan for continued year-on-year pressure on US clinic visit growth in the second half of this year. Offsetting these near-term growth headwinds is the continued expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit at the clinic level, supported by IDEXX innovation and engagement. While year-on-year clinical visits declined 3% on a same-store basis in Q2, diagnostics revenue per visit expanded nearly 9%, consistent with strong Q1 trends. IDEXX' US CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 7.6% in Q2, continues to outpace solid sector growth trends reflected in the 1,070 basis point premium to clinical visit gains. Jay will talk more about how we're driving sustained strong performance on this front in his comments. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting solid gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 15% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 18% in Q2, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 25% growth internationally, as clinics showed continued confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 9% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supported by our global expansion efforts reflected in a 64% year-on-year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Rapid assay revenues expanded solidly in Q2 compared to higher prior year demand levels. Global rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically supported by solid volume gains in the US and benefits from net price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 6%, organically in Q2 as high single-digit growth in the US was moderated by flat organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same-store clinic visit growth in Europe, including increased macroeconomic impacts. Reference Lab, new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally. We achieved continued solid net price gains in the quarter globally with an average 4% growth benefit to US and worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the first half. Our updated outlook includes benefits from additional US CAG price increases implemented in August ,reflecting product and service enhancements and inflationary impacts. We estimate incremental price changes will provide an additional 1.5% to 2% and growth benefit to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2022. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically and 27% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting strong performance across regions, including benefits from net price improvements. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 5% organically in Q2. Tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We've now worked through these comparison impacts and are targeting positive growth in LPD in the second half of this year. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 5% in the quarter as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.7% in line with high prior year levels on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives and improvement in software service gross margins helped to offset inflationary effects and impacts from lower LPD revenues. Operating expenses increased 46% year-on-year as reported in the second quarter and 48% on a comparable basis, including a 35% OpEx growth impact related to $80 million in discrete R&D investments. Operating expense increases reflect carryover impacts from investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We're planning for moderated operating expense growth in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter as we gain leverage from these investments and lap more favorable year-on-year comparisons. EPS was $1.56 per share, a decrease of 30% on a comparable basis including a 32% growth impact related to the discrete R&D investment. EPS results included tax benefits of $3 million or $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation, which was down $0.04 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $6 million and EPS by $0.06 per share in Q2, net of $6 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $36 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 66%. For the full year, we continue to estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets. We're maintaining our full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing warehouse expansion project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash. We allocated $340 million of capital to repurchase 809,000 [ph] shares in Q2. We intend to continue to support our share repurchase program and leverage our strong balance sheet as appropriate on this round. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with the consistent net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 2% full year reduction in share count. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're lowering our full year organic revenue growth range by 2% to reflect first half performance, recent care sector trends and to incorporate potential additional impacts from macroeconomic factors at the lower end of our guidance range. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the recent strengthening of the US dollar and updating our EPS outlook to incorporate current expectations for foreign exchange impacts and projected changes in interest rates. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.305 billion to $3.385 billion, reflects an $80 million to $85 million reduction compared to earlier estimates. This includes a $20 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3% to 3.5% for the full year with approximately 4.5% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q3. As noted, we've updated the full year organic revenue growth outlook to 5.5% to 8%. This reflects a full year CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 6.5% to 9%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies second half organic gains of 5% to 10%. The midpoint of our outlook for H2 reflects CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 7.5% or 8% normalized for equivalent days effects, which we estimate will reduce Q3 revenue growth by approximately 1%. Supporting this outlook are benefits from price increases were advancing in the second half of 2022, which we estimate will provide 1.5% to 2% of additional benefit to worldwide H2 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth building on first half gains of approximately 4%. Net of this incremental price benefit, the midpoint growth outlook for the second half of 2022 is consistent with the global sector growth trends exiting Q2 and reflects expectations for sustained high IDEXX CAG growth premiums supported by continued strong IDEXX commercial execution. The lower end of our second half growth outlook factors in an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. A 5% second half growth rate for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues would align with the low end of growth impact seen in the last recessionary period. The higher end of our growth outlook for the second half targets improved 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth supported by strong IDEXX execution and price increase benefits but will require an improvement in recent clinical visit growth trends. At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for full year operating margins of 26.4% to 26.9%, an adjustment of approximately 50 basis points from our last outlook. This reflects a projected 210 to 260 basis point decrease on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to discrete R&D investments. Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments, and approximately 20 basis points of year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, the high end of this outlook reflects updated goals for relatively flat operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. The full year operating margin outlook is supported the goals to deliver solid comparable operating margin gains in H2. We're targeting flat to modest comparable operating margin increases in Q3 and higher levels of improvement in Q4 as we benefit from higher net price realization, cost management efforts and the lapping of prior year stepped up investment levels. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.77 to $8.05 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of $0.32 per share at midpoint, including $0.05 of impact from higher projected interest rates and $0.03 of additional headwind related to FX. For the full year at our midpoint outlook, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by $23 million and EPS by $0.21 per share. This is net of an estimated $26 million or $0.23 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for the question, Mike. Just on the first part, that's correct. So we had approximately a 4% increase in the US and worldwide in the first half and the 1.5% to 2%, we anticipate it will be an incremental worldwide benefits, so that would imply 5.5% to 6% for the second half. I'll let Jay talk to the customer dimension. So Mike, why don't I walk you through kind of how we're thinking about the outlook analytically and can try to link that back to the underlying sector trends. But just as a grounding, in Q2, the clinical visits year-on-year were down 3%. The revenue per clinical visit was very strong. It was up 8.5%, and that's very positive indicator we think we can build on. But I think the clinical visit levels, as you pointed out, were down relatively to Q1. And we're, I would say, modestly softer than that at the end of the quarter. So as we looked at the midpoint for the second half, if you take the 7.5% midpoint on CAG Dx recurring, there's a days headwind of 1% in Q3. So if we normalize for that, that's 8%. And then if you back off the 1.5% to 2% incremental pricing, it comes up to 6% to 6.5%. So we're basically forecasting that the underlying trends in the sector coming out of Q2 are similar in the second half and that we get incremental benefit from pricing. And the underlying assumptions there are that we're still working through the pullback in capacity that occurred with Fed plans earlier this year. As I mentioned in my comments, there was a big step up from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, 13%, that's sustained throughout 2021. And then we saw about a 2% pullback in the average visit level in the first half of the year. So that is something that given just ongoing staffing challenges, we think we're still going to be working through that this year. And we're still working through the very strong demand compares to the step-up last year, including the benefits from the pet population expansion. So -- to the latter part of your question, we do think we'll be working through those headwinds through this year, and those should improve, those specific factors should improve as we head into 2023, but we're trying to be realistic on kind of just the near-term trends and the headwinds given the dynamics that we continue to see through Q2, and we think that's prudently reflected in our outlook. Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. The adjustment that we made is principally to reflect the more recent trends we're seeing both in the US and in Europe, principally around the visit trends. I think our execution levels have remained quite strong. We feel good about that. I think the underlying revenue per visit utilization dynamics, as you can see in the metrics are holding up well. And we think we can build on that. But the adjustment is principally to reflect the more recent trends, which were more aligned with the lower end of the outlook. Going back to our earlier guidance, we had talked about the lower end reflecting that some of the pressures continue, and that's what we've -- on visits, and that's what we've seen through the second quarter, and we think we're adjusting for that appropriately. I think we're reflecting in the full range that there's some opportunity for improvement in the second half. I think that to Jay's point, I think there's underlying demand that we believe is out there. And that the clinics can adapt and improve the capacity dynamics, I think that could be a positive factor. And of course, we're trying to highlight that there's some potential for additional macro risk that's more difficult to calibrate, but I think we're cognizant that, that could be a factor as well. So on balance, I think we think we're appropriately adjusting the outlook and reflecting the more recent trends. Jon, I am trying to follow your math, but I think that we're not signaling a fundamental compression in the underlying kind of growth in excess of kind of visit levels, excluding kind of price changes. I think we've got a benefit this year. We're roughly 1,100 basis point premium in the US in the first half with 4% pricing that would imply kind of closer to the higher end of that 900 to 1,000 basis point range that we saw pre-pandemic. And our outlook for the year underlying it, we're not specifically forecasting clinical visit growth, but it's more of the trends that we saw coming out of Q2 would imply consistently high levels, and we're not trying to signal compression on that front. So I think we're -- that's something that we need to continue to execute well against. I think that can be impacted by consumer factors at the margin. So I don't want to say that those are things that we're not considering, but I think our midpoint outlook signals that we think we can continue to deliver well on that front and get some additional benefit from some pricing and that will support our solid full year numbers and second half numbers. Yeah. And Jon, it's principally the swing in the clinical visit growth. I mean, we're growing 3% and declining 3% in Q3. So that's 600 basis points. I mean, I think our underlying execution and delivery has been quite good. And -- but -- and the swing in that is, as we mentioned, two factors. It's the pullback in the clinic capacity after a significant period of expansion and retroactive clinics couldn't sustain. And I think we believe can adapt to that over time. And I think that we've got -- we are lapping some of the step-up in the -- the big step-up in demand we saw in the pandemic, including the benefits from the patient expansion. So I think for 2022, that's kind of the key factor that we've been working through. That's the key adjustment in our full year outlook this year. We, obviously, had to make some changes. And this is the change in trend from the second half of 2021, but that's change in the visit level is the clinical visit growth levels is the key difference in terms of where we. It is reflective of the overall inflationary environment. So I think that that's a broader factor that I think everyone in the industry is dealing with. Yes, to your point, to your question, visibility internationally. So we don't have the same size PIMS installed base across the different regions. So we don't have that type of pinpoint accuracy we do in North America. I would say that we're seeing similar trends based on other data. I think it's a reflection of some of the same capacity, challenges in the practices because we know during the pandemic, we saw the same pet boom in countries like the UK, Germany, Australia, what have you. I think the overall factor we see internationally, specifically in Europe is we do see some of the macro impacts that does impact reference labs more so than point-of-care, not surprisingly, there's not as big a wellness or preventive care business internationally, but there -- it's probably 20% or so of the visits, and that's primarily a reference lab modality. So we do see some headwinds connected to that. Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to IDEXX employees listening, I'd like to just say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose on wavering, engagement, enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite the unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. Thankful for your excellent effort and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of 2022. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered another quarter of solid growth, supported by excellent execution by our global IDEXX teams. Demand for pet health care remains high, building on the step function and sector growth of pets and patient visits during the pandemic. IDEXX is a diagnostics and software partner of choice of veterinary clinicians. This was reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued high growth in cloud-based PIMS placements in a sustained IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to clinical visit growth. Our products support veterinarians by creating an integrated clinic-wide solution that helps them expand capacity and grow their businesses, while providing diagnostic insights to support high levels of pet health care. The solid results that IDEXX delivered in the quarter despite some headwinds from near-term clinical visit growth and international macro factors reinforce our confidence in the durability and long-term growth potential of our business, aligned with increasing care standards for companion animals. Today, I'll discuss our performance and progress in the context of current sector trends in advancing key innovation and commercial initiatives that position us for continued solid growth and financial performance. Let me start by providing some updated context on trends in the companion animal sector. CAG sector trends continue to reflect strong global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in the number of pets and patient visits observed during the pandemic. US diagnostics revenue per practice grew 6% during the second quarter, against a very strong prior year base, as veterinarians use diagnostics to deliver best care standards, while benefiting from profitable clinical services growth. IDEXX grew US CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue nearly 8%, two points faster, validating the value we bring with differentiated solutions and an excellent customer experience. Specifically, diagnostics remains one of the faster growing areas of the veterinary clinic continuing to outpace both total practice revenue growth and clinical revenue growth on a same-store basis. US diagnostics revenue growth per practice of 6% in the quarter, as noted was once again driven by positive contribution from both diagnostic frequency and utilization. Diagnostics frequency and the utilization gains were both above pre-pandemic trends even at a much higher base. As highlighted in the earnings snapshot, critical use of diagnostics per visit expanded by revenue nearly 9% in the quarter, offsetting headwinds from lower clinical visits. We continue to make progress on initiatives that drive future diagnostics recurring revenue. We saw increased adoption of our US preventive care program where we provide a turnkey diagnostic solution to wellness care, with approximately 225 new enrollments, the largest quarter of enrollment since late 2020. We're also seeing continued momentum across global regions related to the adoption of IDEXX platforms, reflected in 25% growth in international premium instrument placements, including the successful expansion of our ProCyte One platform. These strong areas of progress have been moderated by year-on-year pressure on clinical visit trends. This reflects a combination of impacts from pullback and capacity levels following a period of significant demand expansion, including the step-up in visits related to the 10% expansion of the pet population during the pandemic. In the US, for example, clinics were open around 50% of weekend days in Q2, compared to an average of almost 60% pre-pandemic. We're also seeing some impacts from macroeconomic pressures, particularly in Europe. We think it's prudent to plan on continued year-on-year growth impacts on these fronts in the second half of 2022. Recent research we performed in the US and Germany, shows that a majority of veterinarians indicate staff capacity is a major or moderate issue, while also indicating they see continued higher demand for appointments. As Brian indicated, we are well-positioned with clinics in working through these dynamics over time to address what is likely underserved demand for pet health care in a significantly expanded global pet population. As we work through these near-term headwinds, we're targeting solid organic growth overall in the second half, building momentum that will keep us on track towards our long-term growth goals. Let's now discuss our ongoing progress in key areas of our growth strategy. A key factor in enabling IDEXX to drive strong utilization of diagnostics within the sector, IDEXX's decade-long focus on building and supporting a world-class commercial team to execute our high-touch model. These capabilities, along with significant new product introductions over the last several years, help our customers grow faster and continue to support strong commercial results. This is reflected in record instrument and software placements, strong EVI games, sustained solid net new business gains in very high customer retention levels. These results demonstrate the market development benefits appearing commercial capabilities with highly relevant innovative products. Our sales professionals have shown an ability to maintain and leverage the deep relationships with customers to support these performance levels despite challenges related to staff capacity, US account manager in-person visits are now over 70% approaching desired end state goals. International access was also excellent at close to 70%, where international growth is a strategic priority, and we're applying the successful US playbook to drive strong placements and new business gains. The second quarter represented continued progress against the strategy with solid year-over-year growth in customer adoption across modalities in Europe. Meanwhile, onboarding and integration of the six country-level commercial expansions have been completed and have gone extremely well. We look forward to ongoing future benefits from these expansions as we work through macro-driven headwinds in regions like Europe, which are constraining near-term organic gains. The international opportunity to drive diagnostics utilization is tremendous, and largely underpenetrated as shared in last year's Investor Day, our advancing global commercial capability and product innovations that fit the requirements of these regions are positioning us to realize significant opportunities over long horizons. Putting the right products and enhance of our capable sales professionals drives continued growth in instrument placements with the resulting highly profitable future consumable streams. Customers on a global basis have never been hungrier for technology that supports care, workflow optimization, excellent clinical performance and friction for use. A key piece of our in-house analyzer portfolio is ProCyte One, the innovative customer-friendly hematology analyzer, which launched last year and has already surpassed an installed base of over 5,000 units. Reception and adoption of ProCyte One has been exceptional, particularly in international regions where many veterinarians were trained to run hematology diagnostics first when doing a basic workup on a patient. We had excellent growth in ProCyte One placements across regions for the second quarter and continued high levels of customer satisfaction and retention, supporting the expansion of our global premium hematology installed base aligned to the approximately 4,000 placements annually as shared in last year's Investor Day. This progress is integral in addressing the estimated opportunity for 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placements. In addition to these targeted investments in enhanced commercial capabilities, technology and product innovation is another key pillar of IDEXX's growth strategy as we endeavor to add value to our product and service offerings. In Q2, we announced three upcoming laboratory tests and service launches. We have a shared mission with our customers to deliver a higher standard of pet health care. And these new products and services support that care delivery to timely and highly accurate diagnostic insights. These innovations also enable our customers to do so in an efficient way by using the IDEXX reference lab as an extension of the veterinarian clinic, which is a key benefit given the current capacity constraints within our sector. These innovations include; number one, expanding Fecal Dx antigen testing to include the detection of fleet taper, the most common type of taper to infect dogs and cats. With this addition, IDEXX's Fecal Dx antigen test detects up to five times more common and prevalent parasites that fecal flotation alone and provides customers with earlier diagnostic insights. This will drive even greater progress towards the goal we shared at Investor Day in 2018 of an incremental $120 million in fecal antigen revenues by 2023. Number two, the addition of FGF-23, a kidney disease management biomarker that will provide clinicians, along with the use of SDMA, not only earlier diagnostic signs of chronic kidney disease but will deliver more confident recommendations for targeted therapy during earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. And number three, a new service of PCR direct testing, which reference US reference lab customers with crucial, timely access to next APCR results, enabled by a new PCR laboratory at our Louisville reference site. The addition of these tests and services support our customers in delivering improved pet health care in ways in which an IDEXX partnership adds long-term increasing value for our customers. In addition to the development of highly relevant, accurately testing products, IDEXX's innovation focus is also on our broad portfolio of software services, including multiple cloud-native PIMs and a variety of tools to manage clinic workflow like Vet Radar, VetConnect PLUS, payment processing solutions and Web PACS. When combined, these products could create a powerful connected ecosystem within the veterinary clinic, which not only improves access to and communication of diagnostic insights but also provides efficiency benefits around the clinic and at each step of the patient visit process. The rapid uptake of IDEXX cloud-based solutions is a reflection of this. Customers understand that modern software tools reduce manual work and increased capacity for clinic staff to focus on higher order patient center tasks. This higher standard of care is further supported by clinical decision support on VetConnect PLUS, which leverages machine learning to offer suggested next steps aligned with care protocols. A great example of this is our enhanced 4Dx Plus introduction, where we not only improved upon our gold standard in a plasma assay, but added a vector-borne disease, clinical decision support module and made significant enhancements to workflow by doubling product shelf life and room temperature storage. We are also seeing incremental follow-up tests for customers engaging with clinical decision support, and we'll share with you at the upcoming Investor Day promising early results. Customers clearly appreciate these benefits as we saw another quarter of record PIMS global placements, supported by continued strong demand for cloud-based offerings. ezyVet in particular, continues to experience strong growth since joining the IDEXX software family. The second quarter placements consistent with the prior quarter and 28% higher than the previous year. These cloud-based solutions enable customers to shift their focus for maintaining on-premise hardware to providing excellent patient care while also benefiting IDEXX through growth of a highly profitable recurring revenue stream in the future. We continue to be very pleased with the advancement of our long-term strategy to integrate diagnostics and software that help IDEXX customers grow faster. Underpinning our growing commercial and technology capabilities is a commitment to providing world-class level of service to our customers, which is integral to earning our customers' business every day, especially given the high levels of demand within the sector. Strong execution against this commitment takes many forms, from consistently high product availability rates to reliable turnaround times at our reference labs. The high service level IDEXX delivered in the second quarter, including greater than 99% product availability demonstrates the benefit of our long-term focus on building supply chain capabilities and highly-scaled manufacturing centers. Our recently communicated US mid-year price increase reflects higher cost to run the business including investments in our supply chain to ensure excellent levels of product continuity and future network resiliency. Given this, IDEXX is well positioned to manage through supply chain and inflationary dynamics, while building on our strong long-term financial performance. This concludes our review. IDEXX's execution levels remain strong and aligned towards our significant and enduring long-term growth potential. We're well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results as we advance our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. I'm thankful there are more than 10,000 colleagues for their ongoing dedication to our efforts. They are integral in delivering strong financial performance for the company and creating long-term value, while also supporting the advancement of animal care globally. To those listening in on the call, I'd like to extend the heartfelt thanks in making a meaningful difference in the world. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that my senior management team and I will provide more information on the IDEXX strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day. After two years of holding the event virtually, we look forward to hosting the event at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 11, from 8:00 to noon. We're also live streaming and recording the event via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and GM for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Julie Godon, Vice President and GM for Global Rapid Assay; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President and GM of Veterinary Software and Services; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also excited to host a live customer conversation led by George Fennell, Senior Vice President and GM of Americas CAG Customer Facing Organization to discuss recent the trends at the clinic level and how IDEXX has supported their business during these pandemic times. The event will last approximately four hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session and an investor lunch with the extended management team. So with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Yeah. So qualitatively, as Brian indicated, the price increase was really, I think, a reflection of higher costs of running the business. And to your question around pet owner pushback, we don't think that, that's been a driver to date. In fact, pet owners have traditionally prioritized pet health care spend relative to other things. It's a small percentage of total consumable consumer expenditures. So it's a relatively small piece. And we know the human pet owner demand has been strong and growing, and we don't expect that to change. Yes. The other thing I would add to that, Mike, is if you take a look at the net expansion in the number of pets visits in the pandemic. I mean there's -- I think there's some evidence that there's a potential underserved demand given this 10% growth. If you take a look at just extrapolate out the 2% to 3% clinical visit trend. We saw pre-pandemic and add in the number of pets, the clinical visits should be higher just based on pet population. So I think as profession works through some of the capacity constraints that we've talked about, I think the -- we'll see a recovery from there. Yes. Let me just maybe directly address your question around geographic balance. So we've done a number of different surveys, both in the US and Germany is our largest country in Europe. And what we're seeing is the majority of veterinarians indicate that stack capacity is a major or moderate issue. Not to say the macro effects, especially in Europe, we're seeing some impact from that primarily more so on the reference labs than in-clinic testing. And not surprising when you consider some of the factors that our European sector and regions are dealing with in terms of inflation and energy and the Ukraine-Russian war is much closer to them. Good morning. Erin, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're in a much stronger position than we were back in 2008, 2009 on a couple of, I think, very important dimensions. Our sales channel, we worked through distributors over a decade ago. And now we have a direct presence in 99% plus from a revenue standpoint. So we have those direct relationships with customers, our portfolio from an innovation standpoint is much more robust across the board, both reference labs, in-clinic software, for example. So I think we offer veterinarians a lot more tools and technology to help manage their practices. I think if anything, that had on our pet bond has grown and is stronger than it was a decade ago. And I think the industry itself, the profession itself is more sophisticated in managing through cycles. I think they're they have adopted a number of, I think, business practices, whether it's individual practices or the corporately owned practices in terms of managing care. So I think we're overall in a much stronger position than we were. Yeah. So from an innovation standpoint, I think we've never been more productive. If you look out over the last couple of years and the type of innovations really across the board from instrumentation, testing, services, software. So if you take a look at the instrumentation piece, ProCyte One has just been an incredible success our customers, I think, have responded exceptionally well to it. They love the fact that it's very easy to use. The performance is very high, and it's priced from an economic standpoint, in the sweet spot of the marketplace. So we've seen really dramatic uptake in our international regions, which is not surprising. A lot of those countries or regions are hematology first marketplaces. And the nice thing about hematology is it's hard to do. It's really hard to do well, and there's a multiplier impact. Typically, we sell with chemistry increasingly with SediVue, as part of in-clinic suites. And then on the software front, I think we're all familiar with the challenges that practices are facing from a workflow and staff productivity and client communication standpoint. So I think practices, which have traditionally relied on on-premise software solutions are looking at contemporary cloud-based solutions as a way to address some of those challenges, and we've seen really rapid uptake in our cloud-based PIMS portfolio, whether it's ezyVet or deal or Anima [ph] in some of our country and regions internationally. From a testing standpoint, we continue to -- as I mentioned in my remarks for reference labs, we've had a number of important introductions over the last couple of months and especially in fecal antigen with flea tapeworms expanding the portfolio for that. It's a fast-growing, I think very important franchise that we have, takes five times -- is up to five times as much compared to flotation or O&P. So it's an important part of the overall reference labs because customers, when they use preventive care panels, it fecals a piece of it, but an important piece of it. So a lot of the I think testing is either anchored or driven by the need for fecal. So overall, we're very excited. We're excited by the in-licensing agreements that we struck and we'll continue to provide updates on that over time, including at Investor Day. So look forward to being able to talk more about that. Yeah. Jon, this was across consumables and reference not capital, and it was a -- primarily a US driven change. We don't have any insight in terms of what competitors or competitive landscape is up to. Good morning, Ryan. We see pretty much across the board, whether it's independent practices or corporate practices, an incredible hunger for those type of IT tools, not just systems, but PIM systems, which provide the pinner-engagement modules, which allow them for \u2013 yes, if you take a step back, about 15%, what practice owners tell us, about 15% of their staff time is focused on just that patient intake piece and administration of the patient. And a lot of that can be automated. A lot of that could be done virtually like it's done in other industries. So the ability to use and deploy these software tools for client communications, for workflow optimization and every step of the patient visit is a high priority for these practices. And I mean -- and we're seeing that in our software business, where we've seen very rapid growth. And I think historically, practices have been somewhat hesitant to move away from PIM systems because the data and they've been trained on it and they have all the reports on it, but they're willing to make that switch now because they see the benefits of what a modern software suite can bring. So I think that's a -- that's only going to get stronger over time as work to address some of the capacity challenges."

In reviewing our first quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our first quarter results and review our recalibrated financial outlook for 2022.  IDEXX delivered solid financial performance in Q1 compared to very strong prior year results. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 8% as reported and organically driven by organic gains of 10% in our CAG business and 8% in our water business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically compared to higher prior year levels, which included benefits from a significant expansion in new pet patients during the pandemic.  Our commercial execution was excellent, reflected in 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and continued strong momentum in expanding cloud-based software solutions. EPS was $2.27 per share, up 3% on a comparable basis. As expected, comparisons to high prior year gross margin levels and increased commercial investments constrained year-on-year operating profit gains in the quarter.  CAG Diagnostic demand levels and IDEXX commercial execution continue to build on the significant step-up achieved during the pandemic, supported by ongoing gains in diagnostics adoption and utilization. We have seen a moderation in clinic visit levels compared to second half 2021 growth trends, which form the basis for our original 2022 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook of 12% to 14%. In the U.S., in addition to early Q1 impacts from higher COVID cases globally, visit levels have been affected by constraints on veterinary service capacity and availability in a challenging labor market, following a period of significant demand expansion.  We saw similar COVID and capacity constraint dynamics in international regions like Europe with additional recent impacts for more challenging macro conditions, which have also constrained clinical visit growth compared to strong prior year baselines. Factoring in our Q1 results and near-term CAG sector trends, we're recalibrating our 2022 full year organic revenue growth outlook. We're adjusting our overall organic growth outlook to 7.5% to 10%, primarily reflecting an adjustment of 3% in our targeted full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range, now projected at 9% to 11% compared to strong prior year levels.  We're also factoring in an additional $40 million impact from the strength in U.S. dollar. Combined, these changes reduced our reported growth outlook by 3.5% or approximately $105 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these adjustments are appropriate as we work through near-term CAG sector dynamics and more challenging comparisons in the first half of 2022. We're targeting higher growth in the second half of 2022, with the high end of our full year growth outlook reflecting return to our original targeted CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range in H2.  We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for Companion Animal diagnostics globally building on the strong gains achieved during the pandemic. We're confident in the sustained long-term growth potential for our business, supported by our ongoing focus on innovation and customer engagement and driving CAG sector development. Aligning with this conviction, we're advancing high-return investments in innovation and commercial capability this year, including approximately $80 million in discrete investments related to the in-license of technology during the second quarter, which Jay will discuss in his remarks.  Our 2022 EPS guidance of $8.11 to $8.35 per share factors and updates to our operating outlook, including $0.72 of discrete impact from the in-license of technology, as well as a $0.10 per share adjustment related to the stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 of EPS impact related to higher interest rates. We'll discuss our full year outlook in more detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by 10% organic gains in our CAG business and 8% growth in our Water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, which included impacts from reduced African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID testing revenues. Combined, these factors reduced overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by approximately 1% in the first quarter. Comparisons on both these fronts will improve in the second half of 2022.  CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. First quarter CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth benefited by approximately 1% from equivalent day effects. Overall Q1 CAG gains were also supported by 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition.  In terms of U.S. CAG sector demand drivers, same-store clinical visits in the first quarter were approximately 2% below strong prior year levels. This compares to 2% to 3% increases seen in the second half of 2021 when we began to lap the step-up in demand -- in testing demand that we saw during the pandemic. As noted, a factor influencing these trends is a near-term challenge related to capacity management of vet clinics that we've seen across global regions, which has resulted in constraints on clinic hours and access to veterinarians. Jay will speak more to these dynamics in his comments.  At the U.S. practice level, same-store diagnostic service revenue growth was a solid 7%. Underlying demand for pet health care services remains high, reflecting a robust multiyear growth trends. Compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic base, U.S. same-store clinical visits and diagnostic revenues increased 4% and 11%, respectively, on a 3-year compound annual growth basis.  IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 10% in Q1 continues to outpace sector growth trends, reflected in a 1,150 basis point premium to clinical visit gains, in part supported by relatively higher net price realization and equivalent day benefits. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the first quarter. VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically with double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, reflecting double-digit gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 31% in Q1, reflecting 24% gains in the U.S. and 35% growth internationally, as clinics show confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally.  The quality of instrument placements continues to be very strong, reflected in 12% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supporting 1,924 premium hematology placements in the quarter, up 101%. Rapid Assay revenues expanded solidly in Q1 compared to high prior year growth levels. Global Rapid Assay revenues increased 8% organically, supported by solid volume gains in the U.S. and benefits from net price increases. Global lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q1 as double-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by low single-digit gains in international regions impacted by pressure on clinical visit levels in Europe.  Reference lab new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally, supported by expansion of IDEXX 360 agreements. We achieved relatively higher benefits from net price gains in the first quarter, with 4% to 5% average gains on U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and solid levels of increases across international regions. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 34% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.  Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting benefits from price gains and a continued solid global recovery in testing demand from constrained pandemic levels. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 19% organically in Q1. As expected, tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China, offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We expect to see relative improvement in LPD growth rates in the second half of the year as we work through challenging comparisons in the Asia Pacific region.  Turning to the P&L. Solid revenue growth supported moderate operating profit and comparable EPS gains compared to high prior year levels. Gross profit increased 6% in Q1 as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.6%, a decrease of 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Comparable gross margin declines reflect the lapping of high Q1 2021 levels, business mix impacts from lower LPD and higher CAG instrument revenues and impacts from higher freight and distribution costs. CAG recurring revenue, net price gains and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset select inflationary impacts.  We're also seeing benefits from improvement in software service gross margins as we expand our recurring revenue base. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year as reported in the first quarter and 13% on a comparable basis. Higher operating expense growth reflects comparisons to controlled prior year levels, as well as investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We also saw relatively higher travel costs compared to low prior year levels. We expect relatively higher year-on-year comparable OpEx growth in the second quarter as we lap these impacts, in addition to the second quarter impacts projected from discrete R&D in-license activity.  EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 3% on a comparable basis. Q1 EPS included benefits of $5 million or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation benefits, which was down $0.11 per share from high prior year group levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share in Q1, net of $2 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $83 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 84%. For the full year, we now estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%, approximately 10% below earlier conversion estimates. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D credits. We're maintaining a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing and warehouse expansion project.  Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.9x net of cash. We allocated $273 million of capital to repurchase 523,000 shares in Q1. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with maintaining a similar net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 1.5% full year reduction in share count.  Turning to our 2022 full year outlook. We're updating our organic revenue growth ranges to reflect Q1 performance, recent CAG sector trends and projected impacts related to the Ukraine War. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.39 billion to $3.465 billion reflects a $105 million reduction at midpoint compared to earlier estimates. This includes $10 million of projected revenue reductions related to our Russia, Belarus and Ukraine businesses, and a $40 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by approximately 3% for the full year, with approximately 4% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q2.  Our full year organic revenue outlook of 7.5% to 10% reflects an adjustment to our original guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, primarily reflecting a recalibration of our full year growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're planning for overall organic growth at the lower end of this range in the first half of 2022, reflecting more recent CAG sector trends and challenging comparisons in the second quarter. We're targeting improved growth rates in the second half of 2022 as vet clinics work to adapt to capacity challenges, and we benefit from our commercial initiatives.  Our recalibrated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook is 9% to 11% for the full year, building on strong prior year gains. As noted, the high end of our full year growth range reflects second half CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth aligned with our original full year goals.  At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for operating margins of 26.8% to 27.3%, down 170 to 220 basis points on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance. This includes approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. This outlook incorporates effects from high-return commercial investments aligned with our long-term growth potential and captures projected inflationary effects on IDEXX's business this year.  Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments and approximately 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, this outlook reflects updated goals for 0 to 50 basis points in operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. Our EPS outlook is $8.11 to $8.35 per share, a decrease of $1.20 at midpoint. This includes $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments, an additional $0.10 per share headwind related to foreign exchange and $0.05 per share of impact from higher projected interest rates. Our guidance for comparable EPS growth of minus 1% to plus 2% includes unfavorable growth impacts of 9% from the discrete R&D investments, and an estimated 2% impact in 2022 from international tax rate changes.  We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to 2022, building on significant gains in demand for companion animal diagnostics and software solutions achieved over the last 2 years. Veterinarians continue to see increased demand in their clinics compared to pre-pandemic turns and routinely choose IDEXX' innovative products and services to meet rising standards for pet health care. This is reflected in our continued solid CAG Diagnostics recurring growth and record Q1 global premium instrument placements, supported by our global rollout of ProCyte One. IDEXX' business strategy is focused on inspiring adoption and increasing the utilization of diagnostics, and our results reflect continued strong progress on this path.  Our integrated solutions not only help veterinarians expand capacity and grow their businesses, but also support an enduring recurring revenue stream in the future. While we've seen some moderation in CAG sector growth metrics from very strong growth levels during the pandemic, we have high confidence in the durability and ongoing growth potential of our business, and our strategy to drive the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for companion animal health care. Today, I'll focus on discussing IDEXX's performance and progress in advancing key growth initiatives that are enabling us to build on our strong growth and financial performance as we serve our mission-driven purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.  Let me start by providing some context on recent trends in the CAG sector. Overall, CAG sector demand trends continued to expand at a solid rate, building on the very strong increases in diagnostics demand seen through the pandemic. As Brian noted, U.S. practice same-store diagnostics revenues increased 7% in the first quarter compared to very strong prior year results. IDEXX's growth strategy has been consistently focused on driving diagnostics adoption and utilization at the clinic level, supported by our investments in commercial engagement and innovation. First quarter results show continued progress on this front.  We've provided some additional information in our quarterly snapshot, which breaks down practice level diagnostics revenue growth dynamics into 3 key drivers: clinical visit growth; diagnostic frequency, or the percentage of clinical visits, including diagnostics; and diagnostics utilization, or diagnostics revenue per visit that include diagnostics. This breakdown highlights benefits for both continued solid increases in diagnostics frequency and expanded growth rates in diagnostics utilization ahead of pre-pandemic levels, building on a very strong gain seen over the last 2 years.  These impressive gains were moderated in Q1 by a 2% year-on-year decline in clinical visits, which is a change from the very solid 2% to 3% clinical visit growth trends we saw in the second half of 2021. As we've analyzed these recent changes, it appears that in addition to some effects from COVID case spikes and weather dynamics in the first quarter, there are near-term constraints on vet clinic capacity that are impacting clinical visit levels.  Veterinarians and their staffs are continuing to adapt to the extraordinary growth in demand over the last 2 years when the U.S. pet population expanded, approximately 10%, resulting in double-digit increases in same-store clinical visit levels, reflective of the sustained pressure on their time as well as staffing challenges that many sectors are facing currently. Pet clinics have scaled back hours. The metric we can track is the percentage of clinics with weekend appointment activity, which declined to 42% in Q1 from 54% levels pre-pandemic, as clinics and vet themselves are looking to achieve more near-term balance in their workloads.  As many pet owners wait longer to secure appointments, underlying demand for pet health care remains strong. But these factors have had the near-term effect of moderating the extraordinary growth pace we've seen in the CAG industry over the last 2 years. We've seen similar dynamics in international regions like Europe in terms of clinical visit levels, with some additional pressures potentially related to the more recent macro headwinds.  Given the near-term clinical visit and macro dynamics noted, we felt it was prudent to recalibrate our 2022 outlook. Our full year outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9% to 11% builds on our 17% average annual growth over the last 2 years, with goals to accelerate gains in the second half of 2022 benefiting from continued advancement of our commercial and innovation efforts.  The longer-term outlook for pet health care remains very strong, benefiting from increases in pet ownership, favorable demographic trends and the continued strengthening of the pet and pet owner bond. IDEXX is well positioned to drive sector growth and help customers service growing demand through our broad array of point-of-care and reference laboratory products and services, all connected by cloud-based software capability, which supports clinic efficiency and workflow enhancements.  The IDEXX team is focused on driving this potential and continues to operate at an exceptional level. This is reflected in continued solid new business gains, record instrument placement levels, high growth in software services and the continued very high levels of customer satisfaction reflected in record high retention models. Our high-touch customer commercial model and innovative diagnostics and software solutions positions us well to help customers work through near-term management challenges to extend the strong growth momentum in our business. Let's discuss some recent progress on these key strategic fronts.  High levels of commercial engagement that supports sector growth remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and we continue to build on our leading commercial capability globally. As noted, we continue to drive strong performance in terms of new business acquisition, with solid net customer gains across modalities and regions. Our highly skilled commercial teams delivered outstanding premium instrument placement performance in Q1 across our platforms, supporting strong growth in our EVI metric in the quarter. We achieved strong growth overall across new, competitive and loyal customer segments as well as within corporate accounts, as veterinarians are clearly looking to use IDEXX technology to manage elevated demand within their clinics. And despite highly variable access levels globally, our sales teams demonstrate that they have strong and trusting relationships with their customers, regardless of clinic type and a keen ability to meet customer needs with IDEXX products, each of which are driving strong customer retention and healthy global installed base growth.  This momentum has been supported by the strengthening of our commercial capabilities in international regions. We're encouraged by the early performance measures like reach to customer and reach to revenue from our recently completed international country expansions. These include Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, Italy and Brazil, while it had smaller targeted investments in our commercial capabilities to complement these efforts as opportunity warrants, including in our largest region in the U.S. Commercial expansions are supported through our center of excellence approach, which enables efficiency, speed of execution and high return on our investments.  Innovation is a critical enabler of our growth strategy. And key advancements such as ProCyte One, IDEXX's innovative and easy-to-use hematology analyzer, continues to gain momentum and provide multiplier benefits for our business. Just 1 year after its launch, ProCyte One is now commercially available around the world and has a global installed base of almost 4,000 units, demonstrating the power of the right product in the hands of a dedicated commercial sales force. This trajectory aligns our premium hematology business with the approximately 20,000 placement outlook we shared at our most recent Investor Day, and utilization rates are trending favorably for customers upgrading from [indiscernible] side. ProCyte One attach rates with Catalysts are high in the mid-90% range, highlighting the multiplier benefit to our broader point-of-care business. This innovative hematology platform is a key enabler to support penetration of our estimated 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity.  Another key advancement in our innovation agenda is 4Dx Plus, the gold standard diagnostic for vector-borne disease in canines, which will provide customers with benefits from multiple product enhancements this year, including the more sensitive end-of-plasma detection, clinical decision support and USDA approval for 2x longer room temperature storage for our point-of-care test SNAP 4Dx Plus. It's an example of IDEXX's whole product approach of enhancing assay performance, workflow and clinical decision support. Additionally, the SNAP Pro analyzer, which has had excellent momentum in global placements during Q1, improves clinic workflows by seamlessly adding test results through our powerful diagnostics portal VetConnect PLUS, and ensuring charge capture of all tests run through of the instrument. These innovative products help our customers improve clinic efficiency and supported solid growth in our rapid assay franchise in the first quarter as we saw seasonally aligned increases in demand for tick-borne disease testing.  As we capture near-term benefits from our existing innovations with customers, we continue to advance our long-term innovation agenda as well. As noted in our financial guidance update, we made investments with 2 companies, the in-licensed technology for worldwide exclusive use in developing point-of-care diagnostics platforms and applications. IDEXX has a long track record of partnering with companies to apply technology that enhances the quality of pet health care. We look forward to sharing more on these initiatives in the future as we build on our compelling real-time care portfolio.  Another key area of strategic focus for IDEXX involves delivering whole product software solutions that address a broad jobs-to-do capability within a single platform. Our PIMS solutions, along with Vet Radar and payment processing solutions, VetConnect PLUS, with clinical decision support and Web PACS, are all increasingly interconnected, offering our customers a seamless experience across the inland productivity applications. Consequently, our customers purchased more of these applications in Q1 than in any previous quarter. We also had record global placements with over 350 PIMS installations, with the vast majority of customers choosing a cloud-based solution. Notably, we made significant headway in outfitting greenfield practices that the IDEXX is a key partner as they establish and equip a new clinic.  With many customers capacity constrained, veterinarians have a significant investment appetite for modern, mobile and well-integrated cloud-based software technology. These software solutions allow our customers to focus on providing care instead of maintaining technology. With our recent acquisition of ezyVet and as preference for cloud-based solutions accelerate, our software revenue base continues to move towards a highly profitable recurring revenue stream.  As we advance our commercial and innovation capabilities, we are highly committed to sustaining outstanding levels of customer support, reference lab service turnaround time and product availability enabled by our highly capable operations organization. The manufacturing and supply chain capabilities that we built over multiple decades allow us to support our busy customers and keep up with the strong growth in industry demand, while managing through a dynamic supply chain environment. IDEXX customers benefited once again from product availability close to 100% and continuously high levels of on-time deliveries. These excellent service metrics demonstrate the benefit of our long product life cycles and deep supplier relationships, as well as our investment in highly skilled manufacturing centers. And while we continue to monitor the impacts of inflationary dynamics in regional COVID-19 outbreaks, we feel confident in our ability to build upon strong financial performance, as Brian outlined in our full year financial outlook.  In concluding our first quarter review, I'd like to welcome Michael Johnson to IDEXX as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Michael brings over 22 years of experience in developing HR leadership capabilities across multiple disciplines and geographies, most recently at Abbott Laboratories, where he was Divisional Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. The Chief Human Resources Officer role is a key enabler of our long-term growth strategy in supporting employee engagement, talent development and organizational effectiveness, and we look forward to Michael's leadership and continually advancing our initiatives and performance in these areas. Welcome, Michael.  This concludes our review of our first quarter performance. Before opening the line for Q&A, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine as the escalating war has taken a devastating toll on people and pets in the region. As a purpose-driven company, we strongly condemn the invasion and violence there. We have been focused on supporting our customers, the health and safety of our employees in the region and true to the heart of IDEXX, the pets that are part of their families. We have significantly scaled back operations in Russia, including suspending sales of veterinary diagnostic equipment in the country. Instead, our focus has been on supporting the essential care of pets to the extent that we can through our existing veterinary customers.  To support the humanitarian needs of the region, we have leveraged the IDEXX Foundation to provide funding to the International Medical Court, the World Central Kitchen and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, while also providing free rabies tests for displaced Ukrainian pets all over Europe. Going forward, we will monitor the situation to identify the additional ways to support Ukrainian refugees and their pets. I would like to thank our employees around the world who have taken part in the IDEXX Foundation Matching program to make personal donations to these organizations.  With that, we will turn to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: On this issue of vet constraints, it seems like we've been hearing about this issue for much of the pandemic. So I'm just trying to get a better understanding of kind of what's changed in 2022 where this is now starting to kind of back up into your revenue guidance, its starting to hit numbers a bit more. So I'm just trying to understand, just finally hit a breaking point where the vets just can't sustain what they've been doing?  And maybe as a second part of that same question, what do you think it will take to start to see visit growth normalize? Do we need to just take a little bit of a pause here for some of these vets who need to hire people? I'm just trying to get a sense of just what's the path forward to see growth start to normalize.  And then maybe just slip in one other one and some of the same kind of topic. Is the slowdown you're seeing here completely that capacity related? So if there were more slots for visits that there'd be demand for that? Or is there also some elements of lower demand reflected in the guidance today?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question, Chris. Maybe I can set some context and Jay can provide more color. On the clinical visit trends, which we've highlighted really were the main change that's going on here that would cause us to kind of recalibrate our outlook this year, we started lapping the step-up in demand in the pandemic in the second half of 2021. And that was flowing through the benefits of the pet additions and the big increases in services and diagnostics that we saw through the pandemic. And the clinical visit levels were up solidly in H2. So they were growing 2% to 3% off that higher base.  And so this is a relatively more recent dynamic. I think Jay can go into this more in color, but it's clearly a significant factor here is the vet capacity. I think that there is a trying to adapt following, a significant expansion of the demand in the industry and just dealing with some of the labor dynamics that many sectors are dealing with in the near term. And we're still working through these tough year-on-year compares. I think that will continue through the first half of this year in terms of the step-up. So that is the primary factor.  Other dynamics that are going on here are all incredibly positive. I think our -- at the clinic level, diagnostic frequency and utilization is up. The service, focus on services, service -- same-store service revenues are still growing. Sales are great. Instruments are very strong, software placements, customer retention, record levels. So this is primarily this dynamic, which we think is largely related to the capacity constraint. And that will normalize, I think, as we work through some of these compares and as clinics adapt to this long-term growth in demand that we think will sustain.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. Chris, let me try to address your question from a context standpoint, both from the standpoint of capacity or supply, and then I want to talk a bit about the pet owner dynamics and demand.  So all the surveys and all the conversations we've had with veterinarians indicate a good deal of optimism about the future and it includes 2022 in terms of growth and their prospects. Their focus is really, I think, pivoted. The pandemic has only accelerated the pivot towards being able to provide excellent medical services and patient care, as well as a pleasing client experience. So relatively less emphasis on things like product sales, specialty diets.  They're also seeing, from a pet owner standpoint, demanding clients who really want full-service care. So speaking with a number of veterinarians just yesterday, they remarked when pet owners come in are still looking to really have sort of an end-to-end approach to care. So I talked about that strong pivot. And if anything, the pandemic, I think, has only accelerated that. And they know that the diagnostics plays a key role in being able to guide care services and the whole clinical envelope.  And to Brian's point, at the same time, there's been a very significant step-up in activity, both in terms of number of patients. There's 10-plus percent more pets relative to pre-pandemic, 10-plus percent higher clinical visits. And the practices themselves, they haven't been immune to some of the labor and staff challenges that, to some extent, all businesses are facing. So they're working through that dynamic of higher activity, while trying to create some balance and looking to increase capacity.  And they're looking at us in many respects, and have this large appetite for things like IDEXX instrumentation. We saw that manifest itself in higher sales, cloud-based software solutions. I think it's both indicative of their optimism for the future, and recognizing that if they have better tools that can support both staff productivity and higher standards of care.  Let me pivot and talk a bit about pet owner dynamics, because I think that addresses your question how this is going to play out over time. By all accounts, we think pet owner demand remains very strong. We all know there's a very strong human-animal bond. And by all accounts, all the data we look at, that continues to grow. We also know that, from a spending power standpoint, just as a percent of discretionary spend that they're spending all in on pets across all economic and demographic cohorts, still under 2%. And the medical services piece, much smaller than that.  So pet owners, they consistently indicate not just in surveys, but in actual behavior that they prioritize spend on veterinary care, sometimes even to the extent that about a quarter or so, that they would spend first on their pet before their own health care. But they prioritize consistently across much larger groups relative to things like entertainment and travel and going out to dinner. And that's even more pronounced in the younger generations like Generation Z and Millennials.  So getting back to -- we know there's been a significant number of adoptions to the pandemic, 10-plus percent over the last couple of years. We look at things like surrenders and we don't see any real movement from that baseline. In fact, what the survey say is that first-time pet owners are looking to actually adopt potentially a second pet in some appreciable numbers. From a headwind standpoint, we know there's some overlays, like working from home and companies returning more to a, sort of, a hybrid-type model. But we think that, that still gives the pet owners the flexibility to be able to take their dog or cat to the veterinarian. So we're keeping an eye on these trends. But I think, on a net basis, we think pet-owner demand remains strong.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Jay, Brian, I want to follow up on some of the points that you just touched on sort of the vet demands and what you're seeing in the channel. Just to put it bluntly, you've got -- if you look at the comps, first half last year, second half last year, obviously, the second half comps on that visit growth gets a lot easier. But if you look at it on a 2-year or 3-year basis, it's actually a little bit more normalized. So we can start getting into the math of you doing a 2-year compare, 3-year compare.  But putting all that aside, what is your expectation for vet visit growth over the course of the year? I mean we're at negative 1.5 in the first quarter. There were some Omicron issues in January, but it seems like it didn't dramatically improve over the rest of the quarter. So what's your expectation for vet business growth in 2Q and then over the course of the entire year? And I've got a follow-up.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, Mike. So on your first question, we're trying to look at these multiyear dynamics too. I think that's largely right. The one thing I'd point out is that the step-up in the new patients that occurred through the pandemic, there was an incremental aspect to the growth that I think benefited, we think, second half of 2021 into the first half of 2022. So there's a bit of a growth dynamic that's additive to making the first half a little more challenging. But I think on balance, we agree that the multiyear trends look quite good, and that informs some of our optimism.  And in terms of how we're thinking about the year, if you look at the range that we provided, effectively, the higher end of the range assumes that we move back towards a healthy positive growth rate on the clinical visit trends. It's the -- as we noted, the CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth for the second half at the higher end reflects our original goals. And so that was what we were seeing coming into the year. And the lower end is more in line with what we're -- we've seen in Q1. So there's some level of pressure year-on-year continues. So we're not explicitly guiding on that metric. But those, I think logically, that's how the full year guidance ends together.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. And I would just add to that, though, clinical visits, it's been an important part of our growth algorithm, but it's just one part. The other thing to keep in mind is the diagnostics adoption and the utilization piece of the business is very strong. We've highlighted that in the earnings highlight where adoption and utilization is at or higher than what we've seen from the pre-pandemic level. So from a customer engagement standpoint, I think we have a pretty well-defined playbook. It's really been honed and optimized over the years to be able to drive and inspire diagnostics adoption and utilization, both through creating awareness and education and ultimately, trialing. But also innovation and continuing to bring innovation that solves the challenging practice and patient problems. So we're optimistic about our ability to continue to do that and do that in an effective way.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And if I could squeeze in a bigger picture one, hopefully it should be quick. At the Analyst Day last year in August, you guys talked about same strong trends, the same sort of secular drivers. And you pointed to your view of the long-term diagnostic sector growth should be a full percentage point higher than prior because of the higher number of pets, because of the adoption, because of higher sort of diagnostics utilization.  But if we sort of flash forward 6 months or 8 months to where we are now, obviously, we're seeing some near-term constraints. So I just wanted to, longer term, are you still sticking with that diagnostics growth of 1% above historical on a multiyear basis?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. Just to revisit, we had a range on the multiyear CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, and we raised the lower end of the range, I think, reflecting our confidence into the range is 11% to 14%. And really what underlies that range, and this underlies our business strategy is our effectiveness as a growing utilization of diagnostics with their customers over time.  And the pre-pandemic improvement levels, as you're aware, Mike, we focused in on this, the percentage of -- the percentage of business that use blood work in diagnostics, and we had been seeing roughly a 50 basis point annual improvement in that metric over time, and that was the pre-pandemic trend. And we saw that accelerate in the pandemic to more like 100 basis points.  So as Jay highlighted, we're continuing to see very nice improvement on diagnostic utilization. So we're very confident in that part of the strategy. That is the part of the strategy that we influence heavily with our innovation and our customer engagement, and we're very confident in our ability on that front. And so nothing's changed in terms of those dimensions.  I think we are working through a period here where we had a big step-up in ownership in pets and demand and through the pandemic, and we're transitioned to growing off this higher base. And we're working through some compares here, but the long-term view of the optimism we have for the business in the long term hasn't changed.\nOperator: And our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. I'm surprised a little that the vet capacity constraints are such a surprise to you relative to your prior expectations. But you did mention, Brian, at the beginning of your prepared remarks, a macro dynamic as well. And I was just wondering if that comment was in relation to the labor constraints or actually changes in consumer dynamics as well.  And we've obviously seen -- and this goes into a bigger picture question of we've seen your business grow in a challenging economy kind of in the past. And can you remind us the sensitivity of your business to a tougher economic backdrop and what levers you have to grow in even a challenging clinic visit backdrop as well?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. Just on -- let me reflect on the comment I made and then Jay can talk more about the resilience of the business. It was specifically related more to Europe. We saw relatively more softness in Europe than we anticipated. And so we're just signaling that it may be related to some of the impacts indirectly from the Ukraine war and higher energy prices and things of that nature. So we -- that it's harder for us to parse that, but it was -- that was what the comment related to.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. Erin, just in terms of the resilience of the business. If you go back to the Great Recession and the recovery in 2008, 2009, our revenue grew 5%. Now a lot has changed over that 10-plus years, and I think from a very positive standpoint.  We worked through other channels, third-party distributor channels. We now have our own direct channel and direct relationships with customers. We know that the human animal bond and the strengthening of the bond has suddenly increased and increased very appreciably. Obviously, there's a lot more pets. And our innovation portfolio, both across the reference labs and our point-of-care diagnostics portfolio, and very importantly, in this environment, software has gotten, I think, appreciably stronger and more capable, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we think we're a very resilient business that has become even more resilient as a result of those factors.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And then in terms of pricing, where is net price realization shaking out now for the year in terms of what's embedded in the guidance and relative to what you disclosed last quarter? And are there further price increases embedded for the remainder of the year?\nBrian McKeon: As I mentioned in our comments our U.S., on average over the overall CAG Diagnostic recurring base was in the 4% to 5% range, so it's a bit better than we had indicated originally, and we've got solid improvements in other markets as well. So I think we feel good about our pricing plans, and that's something we will continue to look at over time.  And I also note that I think vet clinics are showing an ability to pass on pricing as well, and that's reflected in their growth numbers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJonathan Block: Maybe just to start, we also picked up capacity constraints in our checks recently for this quarter. But we actually also had a similar amount, roughly a similar amount of vets start to talk about the demand equation.  And so a pretty direct question here. But for the revised guidance, Jay or Brian, what are your thoughts there? What are you embedding? Is the new guidance all about the capacity constraints, you give those weekend metrics? Or did you also embed some wiggle room or earmark some stuff for the consumer? And what might be occurring or what might still need to play out, call it, into the back part of the year?\nBrian McKeon: So we haven't explicitly projected changes in the macro environment in our outlook. What I would say is that we are capturing more recent dynamics, including some of the dynamics that have been going on in regions like Europe, which as we indicated, may have some macro impacts. And they signal, we're anticipating that the growth in the second quarter will be at the lower end of our full year organic growth range of 7.5% to 10%. So I think we are -- we're trying to capture what we believe includes the capacity dynamics, but what macro impacts may be going on into our outlook, and that's also reflected in the full year range that I shared earlier.  So I think it's not something, again, we forecast specifically, Jon, but I think as Jay pointed out, this has been a business that's always been resilient. If anything, over time, the factors that are supporting our demand, whether it be strengthening of the pet owner bond or just improvements in our own capacity as a company to influence growth and support the industry have only grown. So we think that reinforces we'll have -- we'll be relatively well positioned to changes. And we think we're capturing kind of the more recent trends appropriately in the guidance range that we've shared.\nJonathan Block: Got it. Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a follow-up. And I think you sort of hit on this here and there, but let me try to drill down on a little bit or get an answer. The CAG Dx frequency, you guys give a ton of helpful information. But the CAG Dx frequency or the percent of clinical visits, including diagnostics, that was roughly -- it looks like a 0.5% contributor to revenue growth per practice, call it, pre-COVID. Then it went to 3% in 1Q '21, and then it looks like back to 0.5% in 1Q '22.  Why that move? Why that step down? And then maybe some color, is that a reflection of curb side stepping down as we're normalized and there's no longer the drop-off of the pet and maybe less friction on what the veterinarian wants to test for. Is that why we're seeing that return to normalization? Is that the anticipation going forward?\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. Jon, it's Jay. So keep in mind, that's from -- that 0.5%, which is more of the pre-pandemic historical norm is from a much higher base. So we're building off that 3% base that we saw in Q1 of 2021. And so we both look at -- to the extent that clinical visits include diagnostics, we want to be able to continue to grow that, and we have seen nice growth in this year of that higher base, as well as then when they do use it, are they using more from a volume and dollar standpoint. And that's 8%, which includes some price effect there. So we think that is very healthy in terms of how veterinarians see the use of diagnostics as an enabler to the broader medical services envelope.\nBrian McKeon: And we're hearing anecdotally that pet owners are more invested and interested in what's going on. So as testing is done, they're interested in expanding the scope of services for those owners that are bringing their pets in. So I think the metrics that we're showing here, building off the higher base are reinforcing them.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. Just specifically around your comment relative to curb side, drop off and pick up. We see practices even though we've, I think, transitioned from the pandemic to the endemic business, continue that in -- I mean it's in the minority of cases probably 15-plus -- they like that from the standpoint of supporting the productivity of the practice, a lot of pet owners like that.  I think practices have adopted some level of concierge service around that type of thing. So I don't think that, that's going to go away. It will probably continue to remain a smaller part of that whole. Certainly, it's a step down from sort of the peak of the pandemic, but it's still there to some extent.\nOperator: And our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Maybe the first one on just the margin outlook. Brian, I think if I'm moving -- or looking at the moving pieces correctly, it seems like the core kind of constant currency margin is maybe down 30 basis points relative to what you initially expected. I mean, is that just a function of the lower CAG Dx growth expectation and the deleverage there?  And I guess, kind of as we think into next year and what might come back, I mean if you see a return to normalized CAG Dx growth in '23, do you see -- do you get back any of that, the lower margin, I guess, that you might realize this year, does that come back next year? And then I just wanted to clarify, do we sort of get the -- or do we lap the kind of R&D expense in 2023 and so you kind of get that impact back next year?\nBrian McKeon: Right. On the last point, yes, we view that as a discrete investment that will not occur in 2023. We're not projecting that. So that will be a favorable year-on-year, and we try to provide that specific impact, so you can calibrate for that.  I think your interpretation is right, Nate, that the -- we originally had an outlook this year, clearing away currency and the discrete R&D impact of a 50 to 100 basis point improvement. As you know, that's our long-term goal. We've been doing relatively better than that over time.  It did factor in. We do have inflationary impacts that we're working through this year and some returning costs, things like travel. And we had advanced expansions of our sales organizations internationally in the second half of last year and into early this year. And so it started with a level of growth in costs that we were working to cover through our growth as we always do, while delivering good profit performance. So the 3% calibration in the growth rate is moderating that.  I think that's an appropriate kind of flow through as we pull back a bit on the expected growth. And I think your question is, does that come back? It's not that it is going away, it's can we grow off of that and produce good margin expansion over time? And we believe, absolutely we can. We're committed to our long-term goals and believe we have a really good business model to be able to support that.\nNathan Rich: Okay, great. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I know this has kind of been touched on throughout the call. But what are you seeing the industry do to adapt these capacity challenges? And from your standpoint, is it more a staffing issue? Just, maybe some -- hire kind of out of offices during Omicron. Is it issues with getting kind of vet tax? Or is it more of a clinic or kind of vet capacity issue that might take a little bit longer to play out and solve? I'd just be curious, Jay and Brian, to get some additional thoughts that you have around that.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Nathan, I think it's a bit of all of the above. From the standpoint of -- so there's clearly a much higher level of activity that they're adapting to and we've talked about the staff shortages. And I think there are some staff out, just related COVID even though it's not resulting in hospitalizations. Normally when people get COVID, they have to spend some time at home.  But there's a number of, I think, proactive things that practices are doing, including investing in technology. We see just a very significant appetite for software and the productivity that the software can deliver, both from the standpoint of staff productivity as well as really being able to enable standard of care. And our solutions, whether it's the ezyVet solution or clinical decision support because that's part VetConnect PLUS is an important part of that.  Also instrumentation and the growth that we're seeing in premium instrumentation, it's really -- it's been very significant, 31% increase in growth in placements, 14% increase in our premium installed base. I think that's reflective of practice owners and veterinarians recognizing that they need to have the latest technology.  In other cases, I think practices are looking at staffing mix and staffing formulas and recognizing that they can increase the number of vet techs and in some cases, non-licensed vet techs, at higher ratios than they have right now, and that can generate higher revenues, they had higher pet owner client support relative to their current baselines. So really looking at a broad range of practices to be able to increase capacity.\nOperator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad from Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Thanks, for squeezing me in. So it's kind of an extension of the previous question versus what the veterinary industry can do. I'm curious to see what these challenges mean in terms of capacity constraints for you in terms of the opportunity that it opens up in workflow solutions addressing anything else, both near term and longer term in helping your customers.  And secondly, I just wanted to clarify again on the R&D cost front. Will this mean that your EBIT margin expansion should be back on track from 2023 onwards?\nJonathan Mazelsky: Yes. So I'll talk about this, the opportunity. In addition to what I mentioned from a software in a clinic standpoint, our reference laboratory solutions, testing solutions platform really serve as an extension of the practice. So insofar as practices maybe get strained or they want to send out testing and even our medical services.  So we have a very large group of pathologists and boarded some radiologists and internal medicine specialists, they can do that. So we think that, that is a net positive in terms of being able to support the practices and continues to open up opportunity to that effect.\nBrian McKeon: And on the R&D question, the $80 million investment that we highlighted that will come through our second quarter results, we view as discrete and nonrecurring. And we are maintaining our long-term goals for operating margin expansion.\nJonathan Mazelsky: Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to the IDEXX employees listening. I'd like to say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose and enduring focus on delivering today. Your unwavering support and engagement enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. We're thankful for your excellent efforts and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of '22. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jonathan Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to 2022, building on significant gains in demand for companion animal diagnostics and software solutions achieved over the last 2 years. Veterinarians continue to see increased demand in their clinics compared to pre-pandemic turns and routinely choose IDEXX' innovative products and services to meet rising standards for pet health care. This is reflected in our continued solid CAG Diagnostics recurring growth and record Q1 global premium instrument placements, supported by our global rollout of ProCyte One. IDEXX' business strategy is focused on inspiring adoption and increasing the utilization of diagnostics, and our results reflect continued strong progress on this path.  Our integrated solutions not only help veterinarians expand capacity and grow their businesses, but also support an enduring recurring revenue stream in the future. While we've seen some moderation in CAG sector growth metrics from very strong growth levels during the pandemic, we have high confidence in the durability and ongoing growth potential of our business, and our strategy to drive the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for companion animal health care. Today, I'll focus on discussing IDEXX's performance and progress in advancing key growth initiatives that are enabling us to build on our strong growth and financial performance as we serve our mission-driven purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.  Let me start by providing some context on recent trends in the CAG sector. Overall, CAG sector demand trends continued to expand at a solid rate, building on the very strong increases in diagnostics demand seen through the pandemic. As Brian noted, U.S. practice same-store diagnostics revenues increased 7% in the first quarter compared to very strong prior year results. IDEXX's growth strategy has been consistently focused on driving diagnostics adoption and utilization at the clinic level, supported by our investments in commercial engagement and innovation. First quarter results show continued progress on this front.  We've provided some additional information in our quarterly snapshot, which breaks down practice level diagnostics revenue growth dynamics into 3 key drivers: clinical visit growth; diagnostic frequency, or the percentage of clinical visits, including diagnostics; and diagnostics utilization, or diagnostics revenue per visit that include diagnostics. This breakdown highlights benefits for both continued solid increases in diagnostics frequency and expanded growth rates in diagnostics utilization ahead of pre-pandemic levels, building on a very strong gain seen over the last 2 years.  These impressive gains were moderated in Q1 by a 2% year-on-year decline in clinical visits, which is a change from the very solid 2% to 3% clinical visit growth trends we saw in the second half of 2021. As we've analyzed these recent changes, it appears that in addition to some effects from COVID case spikes and weather dynamics in the first quarter, there are near-term constraints on vet clinic capacity that are impacting clinical visit levels.  Veterinarians and their staffs are continuing to adapt to the extraordinary growth in demand over the last 2 years when the U.S. pet population expanded, approximately 10%, resulting in double-digit increases in same-store clinical visit levels, reflective of the sustained pressure on their time as well as staffing challenges that many sectors are facing currently. Pet clinics have scaled back hours. The metric we can track is the percentage of clinics with weekend appointment activity, which declined to 42% in Q1 from 54% levels pre-pandemic, as clinics and vet themselves are looking to achieve more near-term balance in their workloads.  As many pet owners wait longer to secure appointments, underlying demand for pet health care remains strong. But these factors have had the near-term effect of moderating the extraordinary growth pace we've seen in the CAG industry over the last 2 years. We've seen similar dynamics in international regions like Europe in terms of clinical visit levels, with some additional pressures potentially related to the more recent macro headwinds.  Given the near-term clinical visit and macro dynamics noted, we felt it was prudent to recalibrate our 2022 outlook. Our full year outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9% to 11% builds on our 17% average annual growth over the last 2 years, with goals to accelerate gains in the second half of 2022 benefiting from continued advancement of our commercial and innovation efforts.  The longer-term outlook for pet health care remains very strong, benefiting from increases in pet ownership, favorable demographic trends and the continued strengthening of the pet and pet owner bond. IDEXX is well positioned to drive sector growth and help customers service growing demand through our broad array of point-of-care and reference laboratory products and services, all connected by cloud-based software capability, which supports clinic efficiency and workflow enhancements.  The IDEXX team is focused on driving this potential and continues to operate at an exceptional level. This is reflected in continued solid new business gains, record instrument placement levels, high growth in software services and the continued very high levels of customer satisfaction reflected in record high retention models. Our high-touch customer commercial model and innovative diagnostics and software solutions positions us well to help customers work through near-term management challenges to extend the strong growth momentum in our business. Let's discuss some recent progress on these key strategic fronts.  High levels of commercial engagement that supports sector growth remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and we continue to build on our leading commercial capability globally. As noted, we continue to drive strong performance in terms of new business acquisition, with solid net customer gains across modalities and regions. Our highly skilled commercial teams delivered outstanding premium instrument placement performance in Q1 across our platforms, supporting strong growth in our EVI metric in the quarter. We achieved strong growth overall across new, competitive and loyal customer segments as well as within corporate accounts, as veterinarians are clearly looking to use IDEXX technology to manage elevated demand within their clinics. And despite highly variable access levels globally, our sales teams demonstrate that they have strong and trusting relationships with their customers, regardless of clinic type and a keen ability to meet customer needs with IDEXX products, each of which are driving strong customer retention and healthy global installed base growth.  This momentum has been supported by the strengthening of our commercial capabilities in international regions. We're encouraged by the early performance measures like reach to customer and reach to revenue from our recently completed international country expansions. These include Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, Italy and Brazil, while it had smaller targeted investments in our commercial capabilities to complement these efforts as opportunity warrants, including in our largest region in the U.S. Commercial expansions are supported through our center of excellence approach, which enables efficiency, speed of execution and high return on our investments.  Innovation is a critical enabler of our growth strategy. And key advancements such as ProCyte One, IDEXX's innovative and easy-to-use hematology analyzer, continues to gain momentum and provide multiplier benefits for our business. Just 1 year after its launch, ProCyte One is now commercially available around the world and has a global installed base of almost 4,000 units, demonstrating the power of the right product in the hands of a dedicated commercial sales force. This trajectory aligns our premium hematology business with the approximately 20,000 placement outlook we shared at our most recent Investor Day, and utilization rates are trending favorably for customers upgrading from [indiscernible] side. ProCyte One attach rates with Catalysts are high in the mid-90% range, highlighting the multiplier benefit to our broader point-of-care business. This innovative hematology platform is a key enabler to support penetration of our estimated 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity.  Another key advancement in our innovation agenda is 4Dx Plus, the gold standard diagnostic for vector-borne disease in canines, which will provide customers with benefits from multiple product enhancements this year, including the more sensitive end-of-plasma detection, clinical decision support and USDA approval for 2x longer room temperature storage for our point-of-care test SNAP 4Dx Plus. It's an example of IDEXX's whole product approach of enhancing assay performance, workflow and clinical decision support. Additionally, the SNAP Pro analyzer, which has had excellent momentum in global placements during Q1, improves clinic workflows by seamlessly adding test results through our powerful diagnostics portal VetConnect PLUS, and ensuring charge capture of all tests run through of the instrument. These innovative products help our customers improve clinic efficiency and supported solid growth in our rapid assay franchise in the first quarter as we saw seasonally aligned increases in demand for tick-borne disease testing.  As we capture near-term benefits from our existing innovations with customers, we continue to advance our long-term innovation agenda as well. As noted in our financial guidance update, we made investments with 2 companies, the in-licensed technology for worldwide exclusive use in developing point-of-care diagnostics platforms and applications. IDEXX has a long track record of partnering with companies to apply technology that enhances the quality of pet health care. We look forward to sharing more on these initiatives in the future as we build on our compelling real-time care portfolio.  Another key area of strategic focus for IDEXX involves delivering whole product software solutions that address a broad jobs-to-do capability within a single platform. Our PIMS solutions, along with Vet Radar and payment processing solutions, VetConnect PLUS, with clinical decision support and Web PACS, are all increasingly interconnected, offering our customers a seamless experience across the inland productivity applications. Consequently, our customers purchased more of these applications in Q1 than in any previous quarter. We also had record global placements with over 350 PIMS installations, with the vast majority of customers choosing a cloud-based solution. Notably, we made significant headway in outfitting greenfield practices that the IDEXX is a key partner as they establish and equip a new clinic.  With many customers capacity constrained, veterinarians have a significant investment appetite for modern, mobile and well-integrated cloud-based software technology. These software solutions allow our customers to focus on providing care instead of maintaining technology. With our recent acquisition of ezyVet and as preference for cloud-based solutions accelerate, our software revenue base continues to move towards a highly profitable recurring revenue stream.  As we advance our commercial and innovation capabilities, we are highly committed to sustaining outstanding levels of customer support, reference lab service turnaround time and product availability enabled by our highly capable operations organization. The manufacturing and supply chain capabilities that we built over multiple decades allow us to support our busy customers and keep up with the strong growth in industry demand, while managing through a dynamic supply chain environment. IDEXX customers benefited once again from product availability close to 100% and continuously high levels of on-time deliveries. These excellent service metrics demonstrate the benefit of our long product life cycles and deep supplier relationships, as well as our investment in highly skilled manufacturing centers. And while we continue to monitor the impacts of inflationary dynamics in regional COVID-19 outbreaks, we feel confident in our ability to build upon strong financial performance, as Brian outlined in our full year financial outlook.  In concluding our first quarter review, I'd like to welcome Michael Johnson to IDEXX as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Michael brings over 22 years of experience in developing HR leadership capabilities across multiple disciplines and geographies, most recently at Abbott Laboratories, where he was Divisional Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. The Chief Human Resources Officer role is a key enabler of our long-term growth strategy in supporting employee engagement, talent development and organizational effectiveness, and we look forward to Michael's leadership and continually advancing our initiatives and performance in these areas. Welcome, Michael.  This concludes our review of our first quarter performance. Before opening the line for Q&A, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine as the escalating war has taken a devastating toll on people and pets in the region. As a purpose-driven company, we strongly condemn the invasion and violence there. We have been focused on supporting our customers, the health and safety of our employees in the region and true to the heart of IDEXX, the pets that are part of their families. We have significantly scaled back operations in Russia, including suspending sales of veterinary diagnostic equipment in the country. Instead, our focus has been on supporting the essential care of pets to the extent that we can through our existing veterinary customers.  To support the humanitarian needs of the region, we have leveraged the IDEXX Foundation to provide funding to the International Medical Court, the World Central Kitchen and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, while also providing free rabies tests for displaced Ukrainian pets all over Europe. Going forward, we will monitor the situation to identify the additional ways to support Ukrainian refugees and their pets. I would like to thank our employees around the world who have taken part in the IDEXX Foundation Matching program to make personal donations to these organizations.  With that, we will turn to Q&A. Yes. Chris, let me try to address your question from a context standpoint, both from the standpoint of capacity or supply, and then I want to talk a bit about the pet owner dynamics and demand.  So all the surveys and all the conversations we've had with veterinarians indicate a good deal of optimism about the future and it includes 2022 in terms of growth and their prospects. Their focus is really, I think, pivoted. The pandemic has only accelerated the pivot towards being able to provide excellent medical services and patient care, as well as a pleasing client experience. So relatively less emphasis on things like product sales, specialty diets.  They're also seeing, from a pet owner standpoint, demanding clients who really want full-service care. So speaking with a number of veterinarians just yesterday, they remarked when pet owners come in are still looking to really have sort of an end-to-end approach to care. So I talked about that strong pivot. And if anything, the pandemic, I think, has only accelerated that. And they know that the diagnostics plays a key role in being able to guide care services and the whole clinical envelope.  And to Brian's point, at the same time, there's been a very significant step-up in activity, both in terms of number of patients. There's 10-plus percent more pets relative to pre-pandemic, 10-plus percent higher clinical visits. And the practices themselves, they haven't been immune to some of the labor and staff challenges that, to some extent, all businesses are facing. So they're working through that dynamic of higher activity, while trying to create some balance and looking to increase capacity.  And they're looking at us in many respects, and have this large appetite for things like IDEXX instrumentation. We saw that manifest itself in higher sales, cloud-based software solutions. I think it's both indicative of their optimism for the future, and recognizing that if they have better tools that can support both staff productivity and higher standards of care.  Let me pivot and talk a bit about pet owner dynamics, because I think that addresses your question how this is going to play out over time. By all accounts, we think pet owner demand remains very strong. We all know there's a very strong human-animal bond. And by all accounts, all the data we look at, that continues to grow. We also know that, from a spending power standpoint, just as a percent of discretionary spend that they're spending all in on pets across all economic and demographic cohorts, still under 2%. And the medical services piece, much smaller than that.  So pet owners, they consistently indicate not just in surveys, but in actual behavior that they prioritize spend on veterinary care, sometimes even to the extent that about a quarter or so, that they would spend first on their pet before their own health care. But they prioritize consistently across much larger groups relative to things like entertainment and travel and going out to dinner. And that's even more pronounced in the younger generations like Generation Z and Millennials.  So getting back to -- we know there's been a significant number of adoptions to the pandemic, 10-plus percent over the last couple of years. We look at things like surrenders and we don't see any real movement from that baseline. In fact, what the survey say is that first-time pet owners are looking to actually adopt potentially a second pet in some appreciable numbers. From a headwind standpoint, we know there's some overlays, like working from home and companies returning more to a, sort of, a hybrid-type model. But we think that, that still gives the pet owners the flexibility to be able to take their dog or cat to the veterinarian. So we're keeping an eye on these trends. But I think, on a net basis, we think pet-owner demand remains strong. Yes. And I would just add to that, though, clinical visits, it's been an important part of our growth algorithm, but it's just one part. The other thing to keep in mind is the diagnostics adoption and the utilization piece of the business is very strong. We've highlighted that in the earnings highlight where adoption and utilization is at or higher than what we've seen from the pre-pandemic level. So from a customer engagement standpoint, I think we have a pretty well-defined playbook. It's really been honed and optimized over the years to be able to drive and inspire diagnostics adoption and utilization, both through creating awareness and education and ultimately, trialing. But also innovation and continuing to bring innovation that solves the challenging practice and patient problems. So we're optimistic about our ability to continue to do that and do that in an effective way. Yes. Erin, just in terms of the resilience of the business. If you go back to the Great Recession and the recovery in 2008, 2009, our revenue grew 5%. Now a lot has changed over that 10-plus years, and I think from a very positive standpoint.  We worked through other channels, third-party distributor channels. We now have our own direct channel and direct relationships with customers. We know that the human animal bond and the strengthening of the bond has suddenly increased and increased very appreciably. Obviously, there's a lot more pets. And our innovation portfolio, both across the reference labs and our point-of-care diagnostics portfolio, and very importantly, in this environment, software has gotten, I think, appreciably stronger and more capable, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we think we're a very resilient business that has become even more resilient as a result of those factors. Yes. Jon, it's Jay. So keep in mind, that's from -- that 0.5%, which is more of the pre-pandemic historical norm is from a much higher base. So we're building off that 3% base that we saw in Q1 of 2021. And so we both look at -- to the extent that clinical visits include diagnostics, we want to be able to continue to grow that, and we have seen nice growth in this year of that higher base, as well as then when they do use it, are they using more from a volume and dollar standpoint. And that's 8%, which includes some price effect there. So we think that is very healthy in terms of how veterinarians see the use of diagnostics as an enabler to the broader medical services envelope. Yes. Just specifically around your comment relative to curb side, drop off and pick up. We see practices even though we've, I think, transitioned from the pandemic to the endemic business, continue that in -- I mean it's in the minority of cases probably 15-plus -- they like that from the standpoint of supporting the productivity of the practice, a lot of pet owners like that.  I think practices have adopted some level of concierge service around that type of thing. So I don't think that, that's going to go away. It will probably continue to remain a smaller part of that whole. Certainly, it's a step down from sort of the peak of the pandemic, but it's still there to some extent. Nathan, I think it's a bit of all of the above. From the standpoint of -- so there's clearly a much higher level of activity that they're adapting to and we've talked about the staff shortages. And I think there are some staff out, just related COVID even though it's not resulting in hospitalizations. Normally when people get COVID, they have to spend some time at home.  But there's a number of, I think, proactive things that practices are doing, including investing in technology. We see just a very significant appetite for software and the productivity that the software can deliver, both from the standpoint of staff productivity as well as really being able to enable standard of care. And our solutions, whether it's the ezyVet solution or clinical decision support because that's part VetConnect PLUS is an important part of that.  Also instrumentation and the growth that we're seeing in premium instrumentation, it's really -- it's been very significant, 31% increase in growth in placements, 14% increase in our premium installed base. I think that's reflective of practice owners and veterinarians recognizing that they need to have the latest technology.  In other cases, I think practices are looking at staffing mix and staffing formulas and recognizing that they can increase the number of vet techs and in some cases, non-licensed vet techs, at higher ratios than they have right now, and that can generate higher revenues, they had higher pet owner client support relative to their current baselines. So really looking at a broad range of practices to be able to increase capacity. Yes. So I'll talk about this, the opportunity. In addition to what I mentioned from a software in a clinic standpoint, our reference laboratory solutions, testing solutions platform really serve as an extension of the practice. So insofar as practices maybe get strained or they want to send out testing and even our medical services.  So we have a very large group of pathologists and boarded some radiologists and internal medicine specialists, they can do that. So we think that, that is a net positive in terms of being able to support the practices and continues to open up opportunity to that effect. Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to the IDEXX employees listening. I'd like to say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose and enduring focus on delivering today. Your unwavering support and engagement enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. We're thankful for your excellent efforts and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of '22. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you."

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our first quarter results and review our recalibrated financial outlook for 2022.  IDEXX delivered solid financial performance in Q1 compared to very strong prior year results. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 8% as reported and organically driven by organic gains of 10% in our CAG business and 8% in our water business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically compared to higher prior year levels, which included benefits from a significant expansion in new pet patients during the pandemic.  Our commercial execution was excellent, reflected in 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and continued strong momentum in expanding cloud-based software solutions. EPS was $2.27 per share, up 3% on a comparable basis. As expected, comparisons to high prior year gross margin levels and increased commercial investments constrained year-on-year operating profit gains in the quarter.  CAG Diagnostic demand levels and IDEXX commercial execution continue to build on the significant step-up achieved during the pandemic, supported by ongoing gains in diagnostics adoption and utilization. We have seen a moderation in clinic visit levels compared to second half 2021 growth trends, which form the basis for our original 2022 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook of 12% to 14%. In the U.S., in addition to early Q1 impacts from higher COVID cases globally, visit levels have been affected by constraints on veterinary service capacity and availability in a challenging labor market, following a period of significant demand expansion.  We saw similar COVID and capacity constraint dynamics in international regions like Europe with additional recent impacts for more challenging macro conditions, which have also constrained clinical visit growth compared to strong prior year baselines. Factoring in our Q1 results and near-term CAG sector trends, we're recalibrating our 2022 full year organic revenue growth outlook. We're adjusting our overall organic growth outlook to 7.5% to 10%, primarily reflecting an adjustment of 3% in our targeted full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range, now projected at 9% to 11% compared to strong prior year levels.  We're also factoring in an additional $40 million impact from the strength in U.S. dollar. Combined, these changes reduced our reported growth outlook by 3.5% or approximately $105 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these adjustments are appropriate as we work through near-term CAG sector dynamics and more challenging comparisons in the first half of 2022. We're targeting higher growth in the second half of 2022, with the high end of our full year growth outlook reflecting return to our original targeted CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range in H2.  We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for Companion Animal diagnostics globally building on the strong gains achieved during the pandemic. We're confident in the sustained long-term growth potential for our business, supported by our ongoing focus on innovation and customer engagement and driving CAG sector development. Aligning with this conviction, we're advancing high-return investments in innovation and commercial capability this year, including approximately $80 million in discrete investments related to the in-license of technology during the second quarter, which Jay will discuss in his remarks.  Our 2022 EPS guidance of $8.11 to $8.35 per share factors and updates to our operating outlook, including $0.72 of discrete impact from the in-license of technology, as well as a $0.10 per share adjustment related to the stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 of EPS impact related to higher interest rates. We'll discuss our full year outlook in more detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by 10% organic gains in our CAG business and 8% growth in our Water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, which included impacts from reduced African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID testing revenues. Combined, these factors reduced overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by approximately 1% in the first quarter. Comparisons on both these fronts will improve in the second half of 2022.  CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. First quarter CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth benefited by approximately 1% from equivalent day effects. Overall Q1 CAG gains were also supported by 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition.  In terms of U.S. CAG sector demand drivers, same-store clinical visits in the first quarter were approximately 2% below strong prior year levels. This compares to 2% to 3% increases seen in the second half of 2021 when we began to lap the step-up in demand -- in testing demand that we saw during the pandemic. As noted, a factor influencing these trends is a near-term challenge related to capacity management of vet clinics that we've seen across global regions, which has resulted in constraints on clinic hours and access to veterinarians. Jay will speak more to these dynamics in his comments.  At the U.S. practice level, same-store diagnostic service revenue growth was a solid 7%. Underlying demand for pet health care services remains high, reflecting a robust multiyear growth trends. Compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic base, U.S. same-store clinical visits and diagnostic revenues increased 4% and 11%, respectively, on a 3-year compound annual growth basis.  IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 10% in Q1 continues to outpace sector growth trends, reflected in a 1,150 basis point premium to clinical visit gains, in part supported by relatively higher net price realization and equivalent day benefits. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the first quarter. VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically with double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, reflecting double-digit gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 31% in Q1, reflecting 24% gains in the U.S. and 35% growth internationally, as clinics show confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally.  The quality of instrument placements continues to be very strong, reflected in 12% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supporting 1,924 premium hematology placements in the quarter, up 101%. Rapid Assay revenues expanded solidly in Q1 compared to high prior year growth levels. Global Rapid Assay revenues increased 8% organically, supported by solid volume gains in the U.S. and benefits from net price increases. Global lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q1 as double-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by low single-digit gains in international regions impacted by pressure on clinical visit levels in Europe.  Reference lab new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally, supported by expansion of IDEXX 360 agreements. We achieved relatively higher benefits from net price gains in the first quarter, with 4% to 5% average gains on U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and solid levels of increases across international regions. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 34% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.  Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting benefits from price gains and a continued solid global recovery in testing demand from constrained pandemic levels. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 19% organically in Q1. As expected, tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China, offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We expect to see relative improvement in LPD growth rates in the second half of the year as we work through challenging comparisons in the Asia Pacific region.  Turning to the P&L. Solid revenue growth supported moderate operating profit and comparable EPS gains compared to high prior year levels. Gross profit increased 6% in Q1 as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.6%, a decrease of 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Comparable gross margin declines reflect the lapping of high Q1 2021 levels, business mix impacts from lower LPD and higher CAG instrument revenues and impacts from higher freight and distribution costs. CAG recurring revenue, net price gains and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset select inflationary impacts.  We're also seeing benefits from improvement in software service gross margins as we expand our recurring revenue base. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year as reported in the first quarter and 13% on a comparable basis. Higher operating expense growth reflects comparisons to controlled prior year levels, as well as investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We also saw relatively higher travel costs compared to low prior year levels. We expect relatively higher year-on-year comparable OpEx growth in the second quarter as we lap these impacts, in addition to the second quarter impacts projected from discrete R&D in-license activity.  EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 3% on a comparable basis. Q1 EPS included benefits of $5 million or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation benefits, which was down $0.11 per share from high prior year group levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share in Q1, net of $2 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $83 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 84%. For the full year, we now estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%, approximately 10% below earlier conversion estimates. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D credits. We're maintaining a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing and warehouse expansion project.  Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.9x net of cash. We allocated $273 million of capital to repurchase 523,000 shares in Q1. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with maintaining a similar net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 1.5% full year reduction in share count.  Turning to our 2022 full year outlook. We're updating our organic revenue growth ranges to reflect Q1 performance, recent CAG sector trends and projected impacts related to the Ukraine War. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.39 billion to $3.465 billion reflects a $105 million reduction at midpoint compared to earlier estimates. This includes $10 million of projected revenue reductions related to our Russia, Belarus and Ukraine businesses, and a $40 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by approximately 3% for the full year, with approximately 4% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q2.  Our full year organic revenue outlook of 7.5% to 10% reflects an adjustment to our original guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, primarily reflecting a recalibration of our full year growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're planning for overall organic growth at the lower end of this range in the first half of 2022, reflecting more recent CAG sector trends and challenging comparisons in the second quarter. We're targeting improved growth rates in the second half of 2022 as vet clinics work to adapt to capacity challenges, and we benefit from our commercial initiatives.  Our recalibrated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook is 9% to 11% for the full year, building on strong prior year gains. As noted, the high end of our full year growth range reflects second half CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth aligned with our original full year goals.  At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for operating margins of 26.8% to 27.3%, down 170 to 220 basis points on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance. This includes approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. This outlook incorporates effects from high-return commercial investments aligned with our long-term growth potential and captures projected inflationary effects on IDEXX's business this year.  Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments and approximately 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, this outlook reflects updated goals for 0 to 50 basis points in operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. Our EPS outlook is $8.11 to $8.35 per share, a decrease of $1.20 at midpoint. This includes $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments, an additional $0.10 per share headwind related to foreign exchange and $0.05 per share of impact from higher projected interest rates. Our guidance for comparable EPS growth of minus 1% to plus 2% includes unfavorable growth impacts of 9% from the discrete R&D investments, and an estimated 2% impact in 2022 from international tax rate changes.  We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your question, Chris. Maybe I can set some context and Jay can provide more color. On the clinical visit trends, which we've highlighted really were the main change that's going on here that would cause us to kind of recalibrate our outlook this year, we started lapping the step-up in demand in the pandemic in the second half of 2021. And that was flowing through the benefits of the pet additions and the big increases in services and diagnostics that we saw through the pandemic. And the clinical visit levels were up solidly in H2. So they were growing 2% to 3% off that higher base.  And so this is a relatively more recent dynamic. I think Jay can go into this more in color, but it's clearly a significant factor here is the vet capacity. I think that there is a trying to adapt following, a significant expansion of the demand in the industry and just dealing with some of the labor dynamics that many sectors are dealing with in the near term. And we're still working through these tough year-on-year compares. I think that will continue through the first half of this year in terms of the step-up. So that is the primary factor.  Other dynamics that are going on here are all incredibly positive. I think our -- at the clinic level, diagnostic frequency and utilization is up. The service, focus on services, service -- same-store service revenues are still growing. Sales are great. Instruments are very strong, software placements, customer retention, record levels. So this is primarily this dynamic, which we think is largely related to the capacity constraint. And that will normalize, I think, as we work through some of these compares and as clinics adapt to this long-term growth in demand that we think will sustain. Yes, Mike. So on your first question, we're trying to look at these multiyear dynamics too. I think that's largely right. The one thing I'd point out is that the step-up in the new patients that occurred through the pandemic, there was an incremental aspect to the growth that I think benefited, we think, second half of 2021 into the first half of 2022. So there's a bit of a growth dynamic that's additive to making the first half a little more challenging. But I think on balance, we agree that the multiyear trends look quite good, and that informs some of our optimism.  And in terms of how we're thinking about the year, if you look at the range that we provided, effectively, the higher end of the range assumes that we move back towards a healthy positive growth rate on the clinical visit trends. It's the -- as we noted, the CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth for the second half at the higher end reflects our original goals. And so that was what we were seeing coming into the year. And the lower end is more in line with what we're -- we've seen in Q1. So there's some level of pressure year-on-year continues. So we're not explicitly guiding on that metric. But those, I think logically, that's how the full year guidance ends together. Yes. Just to revisit, we had a range on the multiyear CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, and we raised the lower end of the range, I think, reflecting our confidence into the range is 11% to 14%. And really what underlies that range, and this underlies our business strategy is our effectiveness as a growing utilization of diagnostics with their customers over time.  And the pre-pandemic improvement levels, as you're aware, Mike, we focused in on this, the percentage of -- the percentage of business that use blood work in diagnostics, and we had been seeing roughly a 50 basis point annual improvement in that metric over time, and that was the pre-pandemic trend. And we saw that accelerate in the pandemic to more like 100 basis points.  So as Jay highlighted, we're continuing to see very nice improvement on diagnostic utilization. So we're very confident in that part of the strategy. That is the part of the strategy that we influence heavily with our innovation and our customer engagement, and we're very confident in our ability on that front. And so nothing's changed in terms of those dimensions.  I think we are working through a period here where we had a big step-up in ownership in pets and demand and through the pandemic, and we're transitioned to growing off this higher base. And we're working through some compares here, but the long-term view of the optimism we have for the business in the long term hasn't changed. Yes. Just on -- let me reflect on the comment I made and then Jay can talk more about the resilience of the business. It was specifically related more to Europe. We saw relatively more softness in Europe than we anticipated. And so we're just signaling that it may be related to some of the impacts indirectly from the Ukraine war and higher energy prices and things of that nature. So we -- that it's harder for us to parse that, but it was -- that was what the comment related to. As I mentioned in our comments our U.S., on average over the overall CAG Diagnostic recurring base was in the 4% to 5% range, so it's a bit better than we had indicated originally, and we've got solid improvements in other markets as well. So I think we feel good about our pricing plans, and that's something we will continue to look at over time.  And I also note that I think vet clinics are showing an ability to pass on pricing as well, and that's reflected in their growth numbers. So we haven't explicitly projected changes in the macro environment in our outlook. What I would say is that we are capturing more recent dynamics, including some of the dynamics that have been going on in regions like Europe, which as we indicated, may have some macro impacts. And they signal, we're anticipating that the growth in the second quarter will be at the lower end of our full year organic growth range of 7.5% to 10%. So I think we are -- we're trying to capture what we believe includes the capacity dynamics, but what macro impacts may be going on into our outlook, and that's also reflected in the full year range that I shared earlier.  So I think it's not something, again, we forecast specifically, Jon, but I think as Jay pointed out, this has been a business that's always been resilient. If anything, over time, the factors that are supporting our demand, whether it be strengthening of the pet owner bond or just improvements in our own capacity as a company to influence growth and support the industry have only grown. So we think that reinforces we'll have -- we'll be relatively well positioned to changes. And we think we're capturing kind of the more recent trends appropriately in the guidance range that we've shared. And we're hearing anecdotally that pet owners are more invested and interested in what's going on. So as testing is done, they're interested in expanding the scope of services for those owners that are bringing their pets in. So I think the metrics that we're showing here, building off the higher base are reinforcing them. Right. On the last point, yes, we view that as a discrete investment that will not occur in 2023. We're not projecting that. So that will be a favorable year-on-year, and we try to provide that specific impact, so you can calibrate for that.  I think your interpretation is right, Nate, that the -- we originally had an outlook this year, clearing away currency and the discrete R&D impact of a 50 to 100 basis point improvement. As you know, that's our long-term goal. We've been doing relatively better than that over time.  It did factor in. We do have inflationary impacts that we're working through this year and some returning costs, things like travel. And we had advanced expansions of our sales organizations internationally in the second half of last year and into early this year. And so it started with a level of growth in costs that we were working to cover through our growth as we always do, while delivering good profit performance. So the 3% calibration in the growth rate is moderating that.  I think that's an appropriate kind of flow through as we pull back a bit on the expected growth. And I think your question is, does that come back? It's not that it is going away, it's can we grow off of that and produce good margin expansion over time? And we believe, absolutely we can. We're committed to our long-term goals and believe we have a really good business model to be able to support that. And on the R&D question, the $80 million investment that we highlighted that will come through our second quarter results, we view as discrete and nonrecurring. And we are maintaining our long-term goals for operating margin expansion."

[Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to idexx.com investors after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2023, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 10% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a 1% growth headwind from fewer equivalent selling days. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. These factors and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate supported delivery of $2.32 per share in EPS in Q4, up 17% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution enabled delivery of strong full year financial results reflected in 9% overall organic revenue growth and high comparable operating margin gains. This supported a 29% increase in EPS for the full year on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from a customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. These results were driven by 10.5% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 11% organic gains in the US and 10% organic growth in international regions, aligned with our original full year growth targets. We also achieved 19% full year organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, sustained high customer retention levels and placed a record number of CAG premium instruments, which drove an 11% expansion of our global premium installed base. These strong execution trends position us well as we enter 2024 and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range of 7% to 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're also planning for solid comparable operating margin gains, building on our long-term track record supporting continued high comparable EPS growth. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 9% organic gains in our CAG business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 10% organically in Q4, reflecting 9% gains in the US and 12% growth in international regions, net of a 1% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth was -- in Q4 was supported by average global net price improvement of 6% to 7%, with US net price gains at the low end of this range. IDEXX execution drivers supported volume gains of 4% in both US and international regions normalized for days effects, reflecting an improvement from Q3 volume growth levels and the strongest normalized volume growth quarter in 2023. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, net of 1% negative growth rate impact from fewer equivalent selling days in Q4. This reflects a 1,050 basis point normalized growth premium compared to US clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 0.5% in the quarter on a same-store basis. IDEXX execution drivers drove solid US value growth in the quarter, reflecting benefits from new business gains, high customer retention levels and sustained diagnostic frequency levels per visit. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, reflecting benefits from higher net price realization and improved volume gains. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in continued solid growth in premium instrument placements, which supported a 13% year-on-year increase in our international premium instrument install base. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our major testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting double-digit gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by an 11% increase in our global premium install base in 2023, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology, and SediVue platforms. For the full year 2023, we achieved a record 19,000 premium instrument placements with excellent quality, reflected in sustained, high new and competitive catalyst placements. In Q4, we placed 5,241 premium instruments, up 3% from high prior year levels, driven by strong gains in SediVue placements and continued expansion of ProCyte One. Overall CAG instrument revenues declined 3% organically in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically in Q4, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the US. Global lab revenues expanded 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the US and sustained solid organic revenue growth in international regions. CAG Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 6% organically in Q4, compared to strong prior-year levels. Results continued to be supported by double-digit growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 11% organically, supported by 19% organic gains in recurring revenues. In our other business segments, water revenues increased 5% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, supported by continued solid gains in the US and Europe. Overall growth in the quarter was moderated by lower China revenues and year-end order timing. For the full year, Water revenues grew 8% overall and 7% organically. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 4% organically in Q4 as solid gains in the US, Europe and Latin America were offset by declines in herd health screening revenues and comparisons to higher prior swine testing levels in China. For the full year, LPD revenues were down 1% organically as solid gains across our core ruminant poultry and swine businesses were offset by declines in areas like herd health screening, reflecting regional macro dynamics. We expect to work through comparison issues in herd health screening post the first quarter of 2024. Turning to the P&L. Q4 operating profit increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, supported by solid comparable operating margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.4%, up 50 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for 70 basis points of negative FX impact, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from net price improvement, which offset inflationary cost impacts, favorable business mix impacts from strong consumable growth, and higher software service gross margins. Operating expenses were up 9% as reported and 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting growth in commercial investments and increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms. For the full year 2023, operating margins were 30%, including approximately 40 basis points of benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins increased 390 basis points, including 280 basis points of combined benefit from the customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating margin gains by 60 basis points, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Q4 EPS was $2.32 per share, up 17% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate. This reflected the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, which lowered our full year effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increased EPS by $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter EPS included $0.02 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.04 in headwind from foreign exchange changes primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. FX hedge gains were $2 million in the quarter. Full year EPS was $10.06 per share, an increase of 29% on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, stock-based compensation activity provided $14 million or $0.16 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 130 basis points. As noted, full year comparable EPS growth also benefited by $0.10 per share or approximately 1% from the release of tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. Foreign exchange increased Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 1% and 0%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.24 per share, primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. In 2023, full year foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million. Free cash flow was $773 million for 2023 or 91% of net income. Free cash flow conversion was above the high end of earlier projections, reflecting timing and control of capital spending. Capital spending was $134 million for the full year or 3.7% of revenue. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2023 with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. Our 2024 interest expense outlook incorporates recent forward interest rates and expectations for similar leverage ratios this year. We allocated $38 million to repurchase 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we allocated $83 million to repurchase 175,000 shares. Targeted deployment of cash to share repurchases supports our projected 0.5% to 1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2024. Turning to our 2024 full year outlook. We're providing initial guidance for revenues of $3,930 million to $4,040 million, an increase of 7.5% to 10.5% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 7% to 10% overall, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have limited impact on full year revenue growth. Our reported revenue growth outlook includes approximately $15 million of projected revenue from our recent software acquisition, which Jay will highlight in his comments. In terms of the key drivers of our 2024 organic growth outlook. The midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price gains of approximately 5% and volume gains of approximately 4%, aligned with assumptions for relatively flat US clinical visit same-store growth levels post Q1. As we'll discuss, we have seen some effects from severe US weather trends in January, which we expect will impact overall Q1 clinical visit growth levels. Our full year outlook reflects a US volume growth premium to US clinical visits aligned with our trends in the second half of 2023, supported by expectations for continued solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers. The higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends and overall IDEXX volume growth potential. The lower end of the range calibrates for potential risk to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. The high end of our overall organic revenue growth guidance of 10% is aligned with our long-term goals. We expect overall organic growth to be constrained somewhat by expectations for modest organic growth in LPD and comparisons to strong prior year instrument placement levels. Our reported operating margin guidance for the full year of 2024 is 30.2% to 30.7%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook for 20 to 70 basis points of improvement in comparable annual operating margins, net of a negative 40 basis point operating margin impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. We're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023, supported by continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, expansion of our cloud-based software business, and benefits from lab productivity initiatives. We expect limited impact from foreign exchange on 2024 revenue growth and operating margin at the rates assumed in our press release. We estimate foreign exchange will increase full year EPS by $0.02 per share given current hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the foreign exchange rates assumed in our press release, we projected that a 1% change in the value of the US dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $30 million and operating income by approximately $4 million net of hedges. Our 2024 EPS outlook is $10.84 to $11.33 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 13% as reported and, on a comparable basis, net of a 2% EPS growth headwind from the lapping of the customer contract resolution payment and 1% of headwind related to lapping and benefits from tax valuation reserve releases in 2023. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1.5% increase in our overall effective tax rate to approximately 22% in 2024, reflecting these lapping impacts and lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our EPS outlook captures expected benefits in 2024 from lower interest expense compared to 2023, as well as expectations for reductions in average share count. Our 2024 free cash flow outlook is for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 90% to 95%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of $180 million or approximately 4.5% of revenues. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong financial performance in 2024. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, factoring in approximately 1% of negative growth impact from severe weather in the US in January, and constraints on Q1 growth in areas like LPD related to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Reported revenue growth should be largely in line with organic revenue growth estimates. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for reported operating margins of 29.4% to 29.8% in Q1. This reflects an outlook for flat to moderate expansion in comparable operating margins, adjusting for the lapping of the prior year $16 million customer contract resolution payment recorded in Q1 2023 as an offset to operating expense. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, capping a year where we advanced our strategic priorities while driving strong business growth and excellent financial results. Our high touch commercial model, the focus on the customer, and accelerated innovation drivers supported ongoing sector development. The use of growth in relevant diagnostic testing generates important clinical insights that informed veterinarians' mission to deliver better medical care while growing their businesses in a highly profitable diagnostics category. High levels of execution against our strategy drove double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. This was aligned with our original full year growth targets and reflected strong gains across our major regions. High growth in our durable high-return annuity revenues included strong growth in our recurring software and digital imaging annuity streams. These gains reflected the cumulative impact of double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, supported by high-quality instrument placements, solid new business gains, expansion of integrated cloud-based software solutions, and net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX commercial teams delivered improved volume gains this quarter as we continued to work through factors constraining clinical visit levels. The solid growth momentum we carried through 2023 demonstrates that customers of all types appreciate IDEXX's purpose-built solutions and seek these tools and services to achieve sought-after efficiency gains. We're excited to build on this momentum in 2024. Today, I'll highlight the key capabilities and initiatives that have advanced our strategy to address the long-term growth opportunity for our business, through direct commercial partnership and innovation to enhance care delivery. I'll start with a review of our global commercial execution and its foundational role in creating awareness, education and, ultimately, the increased use of IDEXX Diagnostics. IDEXX's commercial teams bring deep subject matter expertise and a partnership mindset that has resulted in gains above sector growth levels. Solid premium instrument placement growth in Q4 capped off a year of record premium instrument placements. Outstanding full year performance was reflected in sustained high levels of Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts, including record new and competitive placement levels in the U.S. We also realized double-digit expansion of our Premium Hematology and SediVue installed bases. High-quality, high EVI placements, coupled with sustained customer retention rates in the 97% to 99% range for the US and, similarly, high levels globally set a solid foundation for future CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. It also demonstrates our customers' appreciation for IDEXX is easy to use in clinic platforms that provide them with deep diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care, while managing workflow effectively in a busy and dynamic clinic backdrop. Our effectiveness in growing the installed base for premium instruments not only benefits our consumables' recurring revenue stream, but also drives growth across our diagnostic modalities as testing begets testing, and our customers are inspired to expand their use of IDEXX solutions. This adoption of our multi-modality offering is supported by strong customer interest and marketing programs like IDEXX 360, which makes the adoption of IDEXX technology easy and financially appealing. The adoption of these technologies help support sector diagnostics revenue growth in the US in the fourth quarter, which benefited from diagnostic frequency expansion and wellness visits and diagnostics utilization gains overall. Diagnostics remains one of the fastest-growing areas in the veterinary practice, reflected in solid and sustained high single-digit same-store revenue growth at the practice level. Our long-term investments in commercial and R&D resources positions IDEXX well to help our customers build on this momentum. Our growing global direct commercial capability is an important element of this strategy to sustain strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Our most recent commercial expansion was completed in the US during Q4, and is the first in four years as many of our territories have become very large. It complements the seven targeted international expansions we've advanced since 2021 in countries around the world. These are attractive, high-return investments that support future growth by delivering high-touch commercial engagement in our fastest-growing regions, and our commercial teams have consistently shown the ability to complete these expansions while still delivering strong business results. Our international business performance is showing the benefits of our expanded global commercial capability. We continue to achieve strong new business gains, reflected in the 13% expansion of our international premium installed base this year, driven by double-digit installed base growth across our chemistry, hematology and urine sediment in clinic platforms. These gains drove improved international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, specifically for sequential quarters of volume growth normalized for days despite macro headwinds that have pressured same-store sales levels. The expanded footprint of our VDC based commercial model in international regions, customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360, and an expanded international lab network gives us the right tools to successfully address the approximately 2/3 of the total opportunity estimate which exists outside the US In addition to growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, IDEXX also delivered very strong performance this year in expanding our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging segment. Our software and imaging solutions provide busy customers with an intuitive and efficient way to access diagnostic insights and manage important workflow and communications across our clinics. Clinics continue to embrace the opportunity to embed software in many aspects of their business and use technology to generate diagnostic insights, eliminate pain points across back-end areas of the clinic, and open meaningful lines of communication with their increasingly younger customer demographic. By adopting these contemporary software solutions, clinicians and their staff are significantly better able to focus on providing high levels of care for their patients and reduce their time spent on unrewarded administrative activities that either help them practice medicine or help them drive business growth. Supported by excellent commercial engagement and performance, fourth quarter PIMS placements continued to be driven by interest in cloud native products, which represented over 90% of placements in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023, supporting strong double-digit cloud PIMS installed base growth for the year. This high adoption of IDEXX software solutions drove 19% of organic gains in our highly profitable recurring revenues in the veterinary software diagnostic imaging segment this year. These gains provide a growing attractive profit stream to the company and delivers a multiplier benefit as loyal software customers grow their diagnostic revenues faster. Our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues benefit from growth in our PIMS installed base and from our focus on expanding IDEXX's subscription-based service portfolio. IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud native workflow engine for digital imaging, is a great example. We're pleased with the continued double-digit Web PACS subscriber growth which thousands of practices have adopted and fully integrated into the IDEXX software technology stack. We recently added advanced dental imaging workflows to Web PACS, addressing a major pain point for the 75% of practices who regularly take dental x-rays. These integrated dental imaging workflows, including full dental charts and two specific image sorting, streamlines what is otherwise a complicated and time-intensive process for practices. These results demonstrate the benefits from our innovative integrated software offering that is globally relevant to a wide variety of clinics. We're building on our momentum with existing platforms such as VetConnect PLUS and with new solutions to further drive efficiencies within the clinic. One example of which is an updated user experience for the IDEXX VetLab Station, which is a practice team's one-stop control panel and workflow engine. Announced recently at VMX and coming to our customers in the second half of 2024, this new interface will deliver two times two times faster in-clinic diagnostic workflows for all instruments across the IDEXX VetLab suite. Additionally, while both our diagnostics and software businesses rely primarily on organic growth, we continue to look for attractive and strategic acquisitions to deliver more value to our customers and their clients. We recently closed the acquisition of a private US based software and data platform that enhances our software ecosystem and further accelerates our growth in that business. This acquisition extends our PIMS cloud-native workflow and deliver strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients. As we integrate its capabilities deeply inside PIMS platforms, we believe there will be sector growth benefits for deeper engagement between manufacturers, customers and pet owners to drive adoption of highly relevant clinical offerings. Innovation is a bedrock of how IDEXX has been able to provide our customers with critical diagnostic insights that enable and drive the medical care envelope. We've invested over $2 billion over the last 20-plus years in instrument platform development, differentiated assay discovery and customer-facing software, data and connectivity. Our commitment and leadership and innovation has driven sector development through higher standards of care in global animal health. The most recent example of our commitment to transformational innovation is within our point-of-care business. The IDEXX inVue Dx cellular analyzer is an advanced optics and AI platform, cellular imaging that removes the need for clinic staff to prepare and interpret sizes, delivering clinically insightful diagnostic test results while giving valuable time back to the practice. It works by interrogating and interpreting cells in intracellular structures in their natural state, providing spectacular 3D images that enables differential diagnosis to slide-based methods. The near-term menu for this new platform will address highly relevant, high-volume established categories, including ear cytology and blood morphology, both available when we begin shipping the product in Q4 of this year with fine needle-aspir testing on lumps and bumps to be available next. With built-in advanced optics, powerful AI leveraging our global pathology expertise, and two-way connectivity, the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer allows for continued menu expansion, building off our proven track record of increasing value over time of IDEXX products and service offerings. We estimate a 20,000 global placement opportunity over five years from the point of shipment in Q4 of this year, driven by a highly relevant menu and intuitive time-saving workflow. Customer response to initial trials into our announcement at VMX were overwhelmingly positive. In addition to the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer, we also recently announced the latest addition to our Fecal Dx antigen platform at our reference labs. Already the gold standard for Fecal diagnostics, the Fecal Dx antigen platform now identifies Cystoisospora, a common intestinal parasite that typically impacts young dogs and cats, representing the second extension in as many years. Available at no additional costs starting next month, the addition of Cystoisospora will make the best even better and help clinicians have even greater confidence when they choose IDEXX's reference labs for one of the most common time-consuming preventive screening tests. In addition to this expansion on our Fecal Dx antigen panel as planned, we have successfully launched of IDEXX Cystatin B in North America in December, adding kidney injury detection to what is already the most comprehensive menu for kidney health in the industry. Since launch, about 10,000 IDEXX customers have benefited from over 200,000 IDEXX Cystatin B test in North America. Overall, we're very proud of the accomplishments we've been able to advance this year in expanding our business capabilities and value-added partnerships with our customers. Our focus on attractive investment and innovation opportunities, while delivering strong financial results, helped drive exceptional return on invested capital in 2023. With that, I'll conclude by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our purpose and their strong execution against our strategy. These business results require coordinated, intensive work across the organization and IDEXX teams rose to the challenge. High levels of performance across the company, both delivered today in 2023 and set us up well to build off this growth through 2024. There's a significant attractive opportunity to continue to inspire the adoption and utilization of diagnostic solutions and related products. Our IDEXX teams continue to work tirelessly to address this opportunity, while pursuing our mission to provide a better future for animals, people and our planet. It's an honor to report IDEXX's progress and results on behalf of our colleagues. So on behalf of the IDEXX management team, thank you for all your efforts this year. With that, we'll now conclude our prepared remarks and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question, all the color and the remarks here. I guess my question here is just, it seems like you have a bit wider range on the 2024 revenue guidance than in the past. So I just would like a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that range and where you're seeing the most uncertainty in the year. And maybe just part of that, just latest thinking on the macro environment and how you're kind of reflecting kind of the broader macro environment and the guidance for this year. Thanks so much.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, Chris. Yes, the guidance range represents about a 3% range. I think we highlighted in our comment some of the logic around the midpoint outlook, which largely captures, I think, the underlying sector trends that we've seen recently in the business, as well as the benefits that we're getting from our execution. The higher end of the range really builds in the potential for sector improvement. I think that we see clinical visit growth levels, same-store sales levels internationally have been below what we think will be the longer-term trends in our sector. And so that captures a potential for upside on that front as well as even stronger execution from our teams. And I think the downside from that midpoint view is capturing risks, including macro risks. And so it's not all that different than I think where we started last year, and we ended up delivering at the higher end of our range, supported by strong execution. So we'll always strive to do that, but that will involve some improvement in the sector trends in terms of the assumptions that we laid out.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just kind of following up on that. I wanted to make sure I kind of understood the kind of underlying end-market assumptions that's embedded in guidance. I guess, could you maybe kind of talk us through how you see the year playing out? I know you said 100 basis point impact from weather. But I'd be kind of interested if you can maybe just detail your kind of clinical visit expectations for the first quarter. And then you said kind of flat same-store visits kind of post Q1. Would you expect to be around that level in Q2 and then over the balance of the year? And the other thing that I think stood out from your prepared remarks was just the strongest kind of normalized volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Just any color you could share on kind of what drove that, and maybe what you're kind of expecting over the balance of '24? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, Nate. Yes, maybe I can start with your last question just to set context. But we had a very good finish to the year in terms of our performance. As you mentioned, the volume trends when you normalize for days effects, we had 4% volume growth US and internationally that was improved from a softer Q3 and actually was our strongest volume growth quarter for the year. So we feel very good about that, and reflects the ongoing benefits that we're getting from the strong execution by our teams. As we thought about our outlook for, and our plans, for 2024, we're looking to build on that. We highlighted that that's -- our volume growth expectation for the year at midpoint is roughly in line with the strong trends we have coming out of the second half, we'll get additional benefit from the pricing that we noted. I think before the weather impacts that we highlighted, we were -- our midpoint view was for largely flat clinical visits in 2024 in the US and somewhat similar trends in international, which had improved in the second half last year, but were still somewhat of a headwind. We explicitly factored in. We're about $10 million of impact, we think, in the US from the severe weather in January. So we're just trying to capture that in Q1 and flowing that through as well for the full year. But we think that's isolated to January. We're hopeful we'll see kind of or at least assuming we've got a flattening in trends and hopefully we'll see some improvement over time aligned with the long-term growth potential we see.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. And then -- and just to add some color to Brian's remarks. Yes, the end-market appears to be stabilized and healthy. There's good underlying client and pet owner demand, if you take a look at both practice revenue and clinic revenue, it was about 5% in the fourth quarter. From a positioning standpoint, I think customers appreciate the technology solutions that we bring across in all the diagnostic testing modalities. Even more so with software, I think there's a new hunger for really looking at tools that can help them run their practices better, whether it's workflow productivity play, communications, client and internal communications, but also as part of the delivery of care and the way it all integrates. So I think the assumption is that customers will continue to work through some of the capacity challenges that they've had and looking for tools and partnerships to be able to do that. And we're especially, I think, well positioned to help them.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys, and congrats on the quarter, strong end to the year. I wanted to expand a little bit on the inVue. You guys did a great launch of VMX that was really informative. Just curious, you talked about late 2024 launch or 4Q launch. Are you embedding any contribution in numbers this year, obviously, since it's only going to be couple of months, it's not going to be meaningful? But I'm just wondering, of that revenue target how much are you attributing to inVue already? And then the other question, I'll just throw both at once. You talked about 5% net price this year. That compares to, I believe you ended last year at 7% to 8%. So you're kind of sort of moderate back down to historical levels. Just wondering what's sort of been the feedback to price recently as you've announced the 2024 price rollout? And if you could provide any difference on US versus OUS price, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Mike, why don't I just briefly address the guidance question then let Jay talk more about the inVue launch? But the -- we've included the assumption for the launch in our overall guidance. It will be principally instrument revenue benefits in the fourth quarter, as we build the annuity revenues over time from that instrument, that it's all captured in our outlook.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Just some follow-up commentary on the inVue launch. Customers, I think, very excited to learn more about that, as well as our commercial organization. Talking to the customers who are looking for help with those very high-volume relevant tests that they do today, I think, with the ear cytology and blood morphology, it certainly fits into that profile. It helps address what I think is a gap from a care standpoint. Especially on the blood morphology standpoint where they'd like to do more blood morphologies, but due to the complexities and variability and time constraints with slides, they don't always do as many as they would like. to do. So we're very excited by that. And I think it fits the marketplace and it fits that need. And importantly, it doesn't add work. It's not moving work around. It eliminates work that would otherwise practices are left with. So I think it hits on both the cylinders of delivering excellent medical care but also workflow productivity improvements.\nOperator: We will now take a question from --\nJay Mazelsky: Sorry, Michael, you had also asked about the pricing piece. Keep in mind that pricing is -- there's a mix of combination by different customer types. And so there's not a single way to talk about it. We obviously have corporate customers who may be under longer-term contracts, as well as different program effects. So we think that the 5% debt that we provided as a guide both reflects -- is commensurate with the value that we're delivering and very much in line with what customers see from an IDEXX contribution standpoint. Keep in mind, we don't set the pet owner price. That's up to the veterinarian to decide how they decide to price that and mark it up. And typically, there's an uplift that they factor into their practice management systems. And they obviously price through differentiation -- and not just differentiation in terms of the test itself, but also the medical services piece of it.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks so much for coming back to me. Appreciate that, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of BNP Paribas.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on inVue, if you could provide maybe the early KOL feedback regarding the slide-free and load-and-go technology or any other area of feedback and whether you're able to provide more information for modeling purposes, including the timing of additional indication. And I just have also a second question, whether we could expect further innovation to be announced on assays in 2024? And would you consider for further M&A in software? Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So let me talk a little bit about inVue and some of the key opinion leader feedback. We've had a number of key opinion leaders involved as part of the upfront definition and development of inVue. So there's -- we typically do involve them when we're bringing something new to the market, new to the world like this. I think the exciting thing from their perspective is that you're looking at cellular structures, including intracellular structures within their natural state. When you prepare a slide, it's a 2D, I don't want to use the word squish, but I'll use the word you're sort of squishing it. So you're getting a non-natural look at it. When you have a three-dimensional view and can interrogate it in that natural state, you see things that you don't otherwise -- you wouldn't otherwise see and are able to provide differential diagnosis from that. So they're very excited by that. I think veterinarians, in general, are very excited by the fact that you don't have to prepare a slide. They know they spend 10 to 20 minutes on that. It's technique-sensitive, it's highly variable. Therefore, the output in interpretation is variable. So having a solution like that, that's relevant, that's something that they -- is well understood, I think they're very enthusiastic about that. With respect to innovation this year and announcing innovation, not going to talk about that. At this point, we're constantly innovating our product development pipeline, and funnel is filled with very interesting activities. And as we get closer to launch of particular assay or software or instrument, then we talk about it and then we'll disclose more.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just had another follow-up on inVue and then I have another follow-up after that. But on inVue, could the launch be expedited at all? Or could you do like an earlier soft launch with that with that instrument? And do you still have that other diagnostic platform in the pipeline? Is that more of a 2025 event or later?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So with respect to the point-of-care platform launches. We have a very well-defined tried and true method of developing platforms, putting it in the hands of customers, getting feedback in terms of how it works within a real operating environment. We know that there's a difference between bench-top development and what you see within the clinic when we launch something and begin shipping it. We want to make sure that the average time between support events are four, five, six years. These are world-class levels of performance. And our customers expect that of us. We don't want to premature launch and maybe have issues that are disruptive to the practice environment. So we're comfortable with what we've guided to in terms of the timing of that and making sure that it fits within software ecosystem and the overall operating environment of the practice itself. We're not further disclosing our next point-of-care platform other than what we've talked in the past, we have one, it's outside of the existing testing categories, and when we get closer to launch, we'll talk about it.\nErin Wright: Okay. Thanks. And then a bigger picture question. Just has there been any sort of changes or evolving opportunities as it relates to the competitive landscape, I guess, particularly in the US? Could disruptions in sort of new ownership of one of your competitors or changes in distribution for the other -- one of your competitors is that presenting opportunities for you to take share at this point that you may not have seen previously in either across individual accounts or corporate accounts too? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Our markets have been very competitive for a long time. I think new ownership hasn't really changed that dynamic. Some of our competitors were also partners with on the clinical services and equipment side. Customers have a choice. Our focus is on continuing to innovate to help address the challenging problems they have in the practice, whether it's capacity constraints, whether it's introducing new testing solutions, to give them better medical results. What we find at the end of the day is customers appreciate the integrated nature of our offering, the ability to generate seamless user-friendly, customer-friendly way these critical insights that inform great medical decisions that help produce outcomes and do it productively. That's where our focus is and that's where our focus is going to remain.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Jon Block of Stifel Financial.\nJonathan Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian, maybe just from a modeling perspective. Anyway to think about the gross margin versus op margin expansion this year? Do we get GM expansion because another decent year with price? And then if you look at OpEx, R&D was up for the fourth quarter in a row, actually, the R&D was up 20% year-over-year, G&A down two quarters in a row. So just anything on the GM or OpEx to detail as we sort of sharpen our pencils on '24?\nBrian McKeon: Sure. Thanks for the question, Jon. Just to revisit what we shared was we're targeting 20 to 70 basis points of comparable improvement net of the 40 bps from -- headwind from the customer contract resolution payment. So normalized for that, that's 60 to 110 basis points. We think that will primarily be driven by gross margin gains, consistent with the progress that we supported our 110 basis point improvement in 2023. We benefit as we help our customers grow faster and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues grow. That includes price benefits that help us to offset inflationary impacts. We're also continuing to benefit as we grow our cloud-based software business. It's an excellent business for us, and we're doing a great job expanding that business and improving our profitability in the software front. And also have an ongoing focus on improving our lab operations, including benefits from expanding our business. So we think we have a number of drivers that will help us to build on our gross profit gains. In terms of our investment profile, I think you highlight where our priorities are. We want to support our innovation agenda. That's an area that's been very high return for us over time. We obviously have the platform that we're launching this year and ongoing innovation that we're supporting. We're continuing to invest in our commercial operations. We had a US expansion recently that we invested in. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to enhance our commercial capability globally and be efficient overall and try to manage our OpEx largely in line with revenue growth. I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think if we do a better job of growing, grow faster, that always there's an opportunity to get some leverage on that front. But I think our plans are to sustain the OpEx investment in line with revenue and prioritize the innovation and commercial agenda.\nJonathan Block: Okay. Great. That was very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just sort of a long second question, more clarification. So it seems like the 2024 vet visit growth expectation is zero, if I had that right, at the midpoint of your 7.5% to 10.5% CAG Dx recurring. I just want to make sure I got that right. And then what's the expectation for 1Q'24 visits. Was that the negative 1% for full quarter? I'm just trying to sort of get at the implied 2Q to 4Q vet visit assumption? And then just sort of a quick miscellaneous tack-on, anything for price to call out US versus international when we think about the 5% global? And then what about days? Do you get an extra day this year? And does that have any tailwind to the growth rates? Thanks, guys/\nBrian McKeon: Okay. So just on the first one, maybe a simple way to understand this is post Q1, we're, I think I said this in my comments, the midpoint assumes largely flat clinical business in the US. So we're trying to capture that there's about $10 million of headwind that we saw from January. Whether that's principally going to impact the US business, it is US risk, and that will -- we think we'll be seeing in the clinical visit numbers. So we're not trying to estimate that for Q1, but that's obviously a headwind that we're trying to factor in. But I think the bigger picture, Jon, is midpoint, is the midpoint assumptions are largely flat, US clinical visits in Q2 to Q4 timeframe. I think you had a question on price US versus international. We're not guiding regionally, but the 5%, we're expecting solid net price realization globally consistent with what we're able to execute this year. And so I think we're, again, without being specific, you should expect solid price realization in US and international regions. And days, we don't have a material kind of full year dynamic. We'll share clarity as we go through quarter-by-quarter on that, but we're not highlighting that as an issue in Q1 and it's -- or for the full year.\nJonathan Block: All right. Thanks, guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Okay. Thank you. So we don't have further questions. So with that, thank you for your questions. We'll now conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. It's been a pleasure to review another quarter of strong IDEXX results. In summary, IDEXX is well positioned to sustain the momentum we've built into 2024, which will continue to help us address the significant decades-long opportunity to raise the standard of care for companion animal health care. Our consistent strategy focused on supporting increased utilization of diagnostics is a key factor in elevating the standards of care and has helped us navigate the highly dynamic external environment in our sector. We look forward to continued strong execution against our strategic priorities by teams across IDEXX as we move forward through 2024 and beyond. So thank you for your participation this morning, and we'll now conclude the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2023, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 10% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a 1% growth headwind from fewer equivalent selling days. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. These factors and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate supported delivery of $2.32 per share in EPS in Q4, up 17% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution enabled delivery of strong full year financial results reflected in 9% overall organic revenue growth and high comparable operating margin gains. This supported a 29% increase in EPS for the full year on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from a customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. These results were driven by 10.5% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 11% organic gains in the US and 10% organic growth in international regions, aligned with our original full year growth targets. We also achieved 19% full year organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, sustained high customer retention levels and placed a record number of CAG premium instruments, which drove an 11% expansion of our global premium installed base. These strong execution trends position us well as we enter 2024 and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range of 7% to 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're also planning for solid comparable operating margin gains, building on our long-term track record supporting continued high comparable EPS growth. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 9% organic gains in our CAG business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 10% organically in Q4, reflecting 9% gains in the US and 12% growth in international regions, net of a 1% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth was -- in Q4 was supported by average global net price improvement of 6% to 7%, with US net price gains at the low end of this range. IDEXX execution drivers supported volume gains of 4% in both US and international regions normalized for days effects, reflecting an improvement from Q3 volume growth levels and the strongest normalized volume growth quarter in 2023. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, net of 1% negative growth rate impact from fewer equivalent selling days in Q4. This reflects a 1,050 basis point normalized growth premium compared to US clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 0.5% in the quarter on a same-store basis. IDEXX execution drivers drove solid US value growth in the quarter, reflecting benefits from new business gains, high customer retention levels and sustained diagnostic frequency levels per visit. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, reflecting benefits from higher net price realization and improved volume gains. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in continued solid growth in premium instrument placements, which supported a 13% year-on-year increase in our international premium instrument install base. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our major testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting double-digit gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by an 11% increase in our global premium install base in 2023, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology, and SediVue platforms. For the full year 2023, we achieved a record 19,000 premium instrument placements with excellent quality, reflected in sustained, high new and competitive catalyst placements. In Q4, we placed 5,241 premium instruments, up 3% from high prior year levels, driven by strong gains in SediVue placements and continued expansion of ProCyte One. Overall CAG instrument revenues declined 3% organically in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically in Q4, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the US. Global lab revenues expanded 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the US and sustained solid organic revenue growth in international regions. CAG Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 6% organically in Q4, compared to strong prior-year levels. Results continued to be supported by double-digit growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 11% organically, supported by 19% organic gains in recurring revenues. In our other business segments, water revenues increased 5% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, supported by continued solid gains in the US and Europe. Overall growth in the quarter was moderated by lower China revenues and year-end order timing. For the full year, Water revenues grew 8% overall and 7% organically. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 4% organically in Q4 as solid gains in the US, Europe and Latin America were offset by declines in herd health screening revenues and comparisons to higher prior swine testing levels in China. For the full year, LPD revenues were down 1% organically as solid gains across our core ruminant poultry and swine businesses were offset by declines in areas like herd health screening, reflecting regional macro dynamics. We expect to work through comparison issues in herd health screening post the first quarter of 2024. Turning to the P&L. Q4 operating profit increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, supported by solid comparable operating margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.4%, up 50 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for 70 basis points of negative FX impact, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from net price improvement, which offset inflationary cost impacts, favorable business mix impacts from strong consumable growth, and higher software service gross margins. Operating expenses were up 9% as reported and 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting growth in commercial investments and increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms. For the full year 2023, operating margins were 30%, including approximately 40 basis points of benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins increased 390 basis points, including 280 basis points of combined benefit from the customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating margin gains by 60 basis points, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Q4 EPS was $2.32 per share, up 17% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate. This reflected the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, which lowered our full year effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increased EPS by $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter EPS included $0.02 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.04 in headwind from foreign exchange changes primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. FX hedge gains were $2 million in the quarter. Full year EPS was $10.06 per share, an increase of 29% on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, stock-based compensation activity provided $14 million or $0.16 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 130 basis points. As noted, full year comparable EPS growth also benefited by $0.10 per share or approximately 1% from the release of tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. Foreign exchange increased Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 1% and 0%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.24 per share, primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. In 2023, full year foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million. Free cash flow was $773 million for 2023 or 91% of net income. Free cash flow conversion was above the high end of earlier projections, reflecting timing and control of capital spending. Capital spending was $134 million for the full year or 3.7% of revenue. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2023 with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. Our 2024 interest expense outlook incorporates recent forward interest rates and expectations for similar leverage ratios this year. We allocated $38 million to repurchase 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we allocated $83 million to repurchase 175,000 shares. Targeted deployment of cash to share repurchases supports our projected 0.5% to 1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2024. Turning to our 2024 full year outlook. We're providing initial guidance for revenues of $3,930 million to $4,040 million, an increase of 7.5% to 10.5% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 7% to 10% overall, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have limited impact on full year revenue growth. Our reported revenue growth outlook includes approximately $15 million of projected revenue from our recent software acquisition, which Jay will highlight in his comments. In terms of the key drivers of our 2024 organic growth outlook. The midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price gains of approximately 5% and volume gains of approximately 4%, aligned with assumptions for relatively flat US clinical visit same-store growth levels post Q1. As we'll discuss, we have seen some effects from severe US weather trends in January, which we expect will impact overall Q1 clinical visit growth levels. Our full year outlook reflects a US volume growth premium to US clinical visits aligned with our trends in the second half of 2023, supported by expectations for continued solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers. The higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends and overall IDEXX volume growth potential. The lower end of the range calibrates for potential risk to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. The high end of our overall organic revenue growth guidance of 10% is aligned with our long-term goals. We expect overall organic growth to be constrained somewhat by expectations for modest organic growth in LPD and comparisons to strong prior year instrument placement levels. Our reported operating margin guidance for the full year of 2024 is 30.2% to 30.7%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook for 20 to 70 basis points of improvement in comparable annual operating margins, net of a negative 40 basis point operating margin impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. We're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023, supported by continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, expansion of our cloud-based software business, and benefits from lab productivity initiatives. We expect limited impact from foreign exchange on 2024 revenue growth and operating margin at the rates assumed in our press release. We estimate foreign exchange will increase full year EPS by $0.02 per share given current hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the foreign exchange rates assumed in our press release, we projected that a 1% change in the value of the US dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $30 million and operating income by approximately $4 million net of hedges. Our 2024 EPS outlook is $10.84 to $11.33 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 13% as reported and, on a comparable basis, net of a 2% EPS growth headwind from the lapping of the customer contract resolution payment and 1% of headwind related to lapping and benefits from tax valuation reserve releases in 2023. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1.5% increase in our overall effective tax rate to approximately 22% in 2024, reflecting these lapping impacts and lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our EPS outlook captures expected benefits in 2024 from lower interest expense compared to 2023, as well as expectations for reductions in average share count. Our 2024 free cash flow outlook is for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 90% to 95%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of $180 million or approximately 4.5% of revenues. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong financial performance in 2024. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, factoring in approximately 1% of negative growth impact from severe weather in the US in January, and constraints on Q1 growth in areas like LPD related to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Reported revenue growth should be largely in line with organic revenue growth estimates. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for reported operating margins of 29.4% to 29.8% in Q1. This reflects an outlook for flat to moderate expansion in comparable operating margins, adjusting for the lapping of the prior year $16 million customer contract resolution payment recorded in Q1 2023 as an offset to operating expense. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks, Chris. Yes, the guidance range represents about a 3% range. I think we highlighted in our comment some of the logic around the midpoint outlook, which largely captures, I think, the underlying sector trends that we've seen recently in the business, as well as the benefits that we're getting from our execution. The higher end of the range really builds in the potential for sector improvement. I think that we see clinical visit growth levels, same-store sales levels internationally have been below what we think will be the longer-term trends in our sector. And so that captures a potential for upside on that front as well as even stronger execution from our teams. And I think the downside from that midpoint view is capturing risks, including macro risks. And so it's not all that different than I think where we started last year, and we ended up delivering at the higher end of our range, supported by strong execution. So we'll always strive to do that, but that will involve some improvement in the sector trends in terms of the assumptions that we laid out. Thanks, Nate. Yes, maybe I can start with your last question just to set context. But we had a very good finish to the year in terms of our performance. As you mentioned, the volume trends when you normalize for days effects, we had 4% volume growth US and internationally that was improved from a softer Q3 and actually was our strongest volume growth quarter for the year. So we feel very good about that, and reflects the ongoing benefits that we're getting from the strong execution by our teams. As we thought about our outlook for, and our plans, for 2024, we're looking to build on that. We highlighted that that's -- our volume growth expectation for the year at midpoint is roughly in line with the strong trends we have coming out of the second half, we'll get additional benefit from the pricing that we noted. I think before the weather impacts that we highlighted, we were -- our midpoint view was for largely flat clinical visits in 2024 in the US and somewhat similar trends in international, which had improved in the second half last year, but were still somewhat of a headwind. We explicitly factored in. We're about $10 million of impact, we think, in the US from the severe weather in January. So we're just trying to capture that in Q1 and flowing that through as well for the full year. But we think that's isolated to January. We're hopeful we'll see kind of or at least assuming we've got a flattening in trends and hopefully we'll see some improvement over time aligned with the long-term growth potential we see. Mike, why don't I just briefly address the guidance question then let Jay talk more about the inVue launch? But the -- we've included the assumption for the launch in our overall guidance. It will be principally instrument revenue benefits in the fourth quarter, as we build the annuity revenues over time from that instrument, that it's all captured in our outlook. Sure. Thanks for the question, Jon. Just to revisit what we shared was we're targeting 20 to 70 basis points of comparable improvement net of the 40 bps from -- headwind from the customer contract resolution payment. So normalized for that, that's 60 to 110 basis points. We think that will primarily be driven by gross margin gains, consistent with the progress that we supported our 110 basis point improvement in 2023. We benefit as we help our customers grow faster and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues grow. That includes price benefits that help us to offset inflationary impacts. We're also continuing to benefit as we grow our cloud-based software business. It's an excellent business for us, and we're doing a great job expanding that business and improving our profitability in the software front. And also have an ongoing focus on improving our lab operations, including benefits from expanding our business. So we think we have a number of drivers that will help us to build on our gross profit gains. In terms of our investment profile, I think you highlight where our priorities are. We want to support our innovation agenda. That's an area that's been very high return for us over time. We obviously have the platform that we're launching this year and ongoing innovation that we're supporting. We're continuing to invest in our commercial operations. We had a US expansion recently that we invested in. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to enhance our commercial capability globally and be efficient overall and try to manage our OpEx largely in line with revenue growth. I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think if we do a better job of growing, grow faster, that always there's an opportunity to get some leverage on that front. But I think our plans are to sustain the OpEx investment in line with revenue and prioritize the innovation and commercial agenda. Okay. So just on the first one, maybe a simple way to understand this is post Q1, we're, I think I said this in my comments, the midpoint assumes largely flat clinical business in the US. So we're trying to capture that there's about $10 million of headwind that we saw from January. Whether that's principally going to impact the US business, it is US risk, and that will -- we think we'll be seeing in the clinical visit numbers. So we're not trying to estimate that for Q1, but that's obviously a headwind that we're trying to factor in. But I think the bigger picture, Jon, is midpoint, is the midpoint assumptions are largely flat, US clinical visits in Q2 to Q4 timeframe. I think you had a question on price US versus international. We're not guiding regionally, but the 5%, we're expecting solid net price realization globally consistent with what we're able to execute this year. And so I think we're, again, without being specific, you should expect solid price realization in US and international regions. And days, we don't have a material kind of full year dynamic. We'll share clarity as we go through quarter-by-quarter on that, but we're not highlighting that as an issue in Q1 and it's -- or for the full year."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, capping a year where we advanced our strategic priorities while driving strong business growth and excellent financial results. Our high touch commercial model, the focus on the customer, and accelerated innovation drivers supported ongoing sector development. The use of growth in relevant diagnostic testing generates important clinical insights that informed veterinarians' mission to deliver better medical care while growing their businesses in a highly profitable diagnostics category. High levels of execution against our strategy drove double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. This was aligned with our original full year growth targets and reflected strong gains across our major regions. High growth in our durable high-return annuity revenues included strong growth in our recurring software and digital imaging annuity streams. These gains reflected the cumulative impact of double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, supported by high-quality instrument placements, solid new business gains, expansion of integrated cloud-based software solutions, and net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX commercial teams delivered improved volume gains this quarter as we continued to work through factors constraining clinical visit levels. The solid growth momentum we carried through 2023 demonstrates that customers of all types appreciate IDEXX's purpose-built solutions and seek these tools and services to achieve sought-after efficiency gains. We're excited to build on this momentum in 2024. Today, I'll highlight the key capabilities and initiatives that have advanced our strategy to address the long-term growth opportunity for our business, through direct commercial partnership and innovation to enhance care delivery. I'll start with a review of our global commercial execution and its foundational role in creating awareness, education and, ultimately, the increased use of IDEXX Diagnostics. IDEXX's commercial teams bring deep subject matter expertise and a partnership mindset that has resulted in gains above sector growth levels. Solid premium instrument placement growth in Q4 capped off a year of record premium instrument placements. Outstanding full year performance was reflected in sustained high levels of Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts, including record new and competitive placement levels in the U.S. We also realized double-digit expansion of our Premium Hematology and SediVue installed bases. High-quality, high EVI placements, coupled with sustained customer retention rates in the 97% to 99% range for the US and, similarly, high levels globally set a solid foundation for future CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. It also demonstrates our customers' appreciation for IDEXX is easy to use in clinic platforms that provide them with deep diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care, while managing workflow effectively in a busy and dynamic clinic backdrop. Our effectiveness in growing the installed base for premium instruments not only benefits our consumables' recurring revenue stream, but also drives growth across our diagnostic modalities as testing begets testing, and our customers are inspired to expand their use of IDEXX solutions. This adoption of our multi-modality offering is supported by strong customer interest and marketing programs like IDEXX 360, which makes the adoption of IDEXX technology easy and financially appealing. The adoption of these technologies help support sector diagnostics revenue growth in the US in the fourth quarter, which benefited from diagnostic frequency expansion and wellness visits and diagnostics utilization gains overall. Diagnostics remains one of the fastest-growing areas in the veterinary practice, reflected in solid and sustained high single-digit same-store revenue growth at the practice level. Our long-term investments in commercial and R&D resources positions IDEXX well to help our customers build on this momentum. Our growing global direct commercial capability is an important element of this strategy to sustain strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Our most recent commercial expansion was completed in the US during Q4, and is the first in four years as many of our territories have become very large. It complements the seven targeted international expansions we've advanced since 2021 in countries around the world. These are attractive, high-return investments that support future growth by delivering high-touch commercial engagement in our fastest-growing regions, and our commercial teams have consistently shown the ability to complete these expansions while still delivering strong business results. Our international business performance is showing the benefits of our expanded global commercial capability. We continue to achieve strong new business gains, reflected in the 13% expansion of our international premium installed base this year, driven by double-digit installed base growth across our chemistry, hematology and urine sediment in clinic platforms. These gains drove improved international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, specifically for sequential quarters of volume growth normalized for days despite macro headwinds that have pressured same-store sales levels. The expanded footprint of our VDC based commercial model in international regions, customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360, and an expanded international lab network gives us the right tools to successfully address the approximately 2/3 of the total opportunity estimate which exists outside the US In addition to growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, IDEXX also delivered very strong performance this year in expanding our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging segment. Our software and imaging solutions provide busy customers with an intuitive and efficient way to access diagnostic insights and manage important workflow and communications across our clinics. Clinics continue to embrace the opportunity to embed software in many aspects of their business and use technology to generate diagnostic insights, eliminate pain points across back-end areas of the clinic, and open meaningful lines of communication with their increasingly younger customer demographic. By adopting these contemporary software solutions, clinicians and their staff are significantly better able to focus on providing high levels of care for their patients and reduce their time spent on unrewarded administrative activities that either help them practice medicine or help them drive business growth. Supported by excellent commercial engagement and performance, fourth quarter PIMS placements continued to be driven by interest in cloud native products, which represented over 90% of placements in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023, supporting strong double-digit cloud PIMS installed base growth for the year. This high adoption of IDEXX software solutions drove 19% of organic gains in our highly profitable recurring revenues in the veterinary software diagnostic imaging segment this year. These gains provide a growing attractive profit stream to the company and delivers a multiplier benefit as loyal software customers grow their diagnostic revenues faster. Our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues benefit from growth in our PIMS installed base and from our focus on expanding IDEXX's subscription-based service portfolio. IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud native workflow engine for digital imaging, is a great example. We're pleased with the continued double-digit Web PACS subscriber growth which thousands of practices have adopted and fully integrated into the IDEXX software technology stack. We recently added advanced dental imaging workflows to Web PACS, addressing a major pain point for the 75% of practices who regularly take dental x-rays. These integrated dental imaging workflows, including full dental charts and two specific image sorting, streamlines what is otherwise a complicated and time-intensive process for practices. These results demonstrate the benefits from our innovative integrated software offering that is globally relevant to a wide variety of clinics. We're building on our momentum with existing platforms such as VetConnect PLUS and with new solutions to further drive efficiencies within the clinic. One example of which is an updated user experience for the IDEXX VetLab Station, which is a practice team's one-stop control panel and workflow engine. Announced recently at VMX and coming to our customers in the second half of 2024, this new interface will deliver two times two times faster in-clinic diagnostic workflows for all instruments across the IDEXX VetLab suite. Additionally, while both our diagnostics and software businesses rely primarily on organic growth, we continue to look for attractive and strategic acquisitions to deliver more value to our customers and their clients. We recently closed the acquisition of a private US based software and data platform that enhances our software ecosystem and further accelerates our growth in that business. This acquisition extends our PIMS cloud-native workflow and deliver strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients. As we integrate its capabilities deeply inside PIMS platforms, we believe there will be sector growth benefits for deeper engagement between manufacturers, customers and pet owners to drive adoption of highly relevant clinical offerings. Innovation is a bedrock of how IDEXX has been able to provide our customers with critical diagnostic insights that enable and drive the medical care envelope. We've invested over $2 billion over the last 20-plus years in instrument platform development, differentiated assay discovery and customer-facing software, data and connectivity. Our commitment and leadership and innovation has driven sector development through higher standards of care in global animal health. The most recent example of our commitment to transformational innovation is within our point-of-care business. The IDEXX inVue Dx cellular analyzer is an advanced optics and AI platform, cellular imaging that removes the need for clinic staff to prepare and interpret sizes, delivering clinically insightful diagnostic test results while giving valuable time back to the practice. It works by interrogating and interpreting cells in intracellular structures in their natural state, providing spectacular 3D images that enables differential diagnosis to slide-based methods. The near-term menu for this new platform will address highly relevant, high-volume established categories, including ear cytology and blood morphology, both available when we begin shipping the product in Q4 of this year with fine needle-aspir testing on lumps and bumps to be available next. With built-in advanced optics, powerful AI leveraging our global pathology expertise, and two-way connectivity, the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer allows for continued menu expansion, building off our proven track record of increasing value over time of IDEXX products and service offerings. We estimate a 20,000 global placement opportunity over five years from the point of shipment in Q4 of this year, driven by a highly relevant menu and intuitive time-saving workflow. Customer response to initial trials into our announcement at VMX were overwhelmingly positive. In addition to the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer, we also recently announced the latest addition to our Fecal Dx antigen platform at our reference labs. Already the gold standard for Fecal diagnostics, the Fecal Dx antigen platform now identifies Cystoisospora, a common intestinal parasite that typically impacts young dogs and cats, representing the second extension in as many years. Available at no additional costs starting next month, the addition of Cystoisospora will make the best even better and help clinicians have even greater confidence when they choose IDEXX's reference labs for one of the most common time-consuming preventive screening tests. In addition to this expansion on our Fecal Dx antigen panel as planned, we have successfully launched of IDEXX Cystatin B in North America in December, adding kidney injury detection to what is already the most comprehensive menu for kidney health in the industry. Since launch, about 10,000 IDEXX customers have benefited from over 200,000 IDEXX Cystatin B test in North America. Overall, we're very proud of the accomplishments we've been able to advance this year in expanding our business capabilities and value-added partnerships with our customers. Our focus on attractive investment and innovation opportunities, while delivering strong financial results, helped drive exceptional return on invested capital in 2023. With that, I'll conclude by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our purpose and their strong execution against our strategy. These business results require coordinated, intensive work across the organization and IDEXX teams rose to the challenge. High levels of performance across the company, both delivered today in 2023 and set us up well to build off this growth through 2024. There's a significant attractive opportunity to continue to inspire the adoption and utilization of diagnostic solutions and related products. Our IDEXX teams continue to work tirelessly to address this opportunity, while pursuing our mission to provide a better future for animals, people and our planet. It's an honor to report IDEXX's progress and results on behalf of our colleagues. So on behalf of the IDEXX management team, thank you for all your efforts this year. With that, we'll now conclude our prepared remarks and open the line for Q&A. Yes. And then -- and just to add some color to Brian's remarks. Yes, the end-market appears to be stabilized and healthy. There's good underlying client and pet owner demand, if you take a look at both practice revenue and clinic revenue, it was about 5% in the fourth quarter. From a positioning standpoint, I think customers appreciate the technology solutions that we bring across in all the diagnostic testing modalities. Even more so with software, I think there's a new hunger for really looking at tools that can help them run their practices better, whether it's workflow productivity play, communications, client and internal communications, but also as part of the delivery of care and the way it all integrates. So I think the assumption is that customers will continue to work through some of the capacity challenges that they've had and looking for tools and partnerships to be able to do that. And we're especially, I think, well positioned to help them. Yes. Just some follow-up commentary on the inVue launch. Customers, I think, very excited to learn more about that, as well as our commercial organization. Talking to the customers who are looking for help with those very high-volume relevant tests that they do today, I think, with the ear cytology and blood morphology, it certainly fits into that profile. It helps address what I think is a gap from a care standpoint. Especially on the blood morphology standpoint where they'd like to do more blood morphologies, but due to the complexities and variability and time constraints with slides, they don't always do as many as they would like. to do. So we're very excited by that. And I think it fits the marketplace and it fits that need. And importantly, it doesn't add work. It's not moving work around. It eliminates work that would otherwise practices are left with. So I think it hits on both the cylinders of delivering excellent medical care but also workflow productivity improvements. Sorry, Michael, you had also asked about the pricing piece. Keep in mind that pricing is -- there's a mix of combination by different customer types. And so there's not a single way to talk about it. We obviously have corporate customers who may be under longer-term contracts, as well as different program effects. So we think that the 5% debt that we provided as a guide both reflects -- is commensurate with the value that we're delivering and very much in line with what customers see from an IDEXX contribution standpoint. Keep in mind, we don't set the pet owner price. That's up to the veterinarian to decide how they decide to price that and mark it up. And typically, there's an uplift that they factor into their practice management systems. And they obviously price through differentiation -- and not just differentiation in terms of the test itself, but also the medical services piece of it. Yes. So let me talk a little bit about inVue and some of the key opinion leader feedback. We've had a number of key opinion leaders involved as part of the upfront definition and development of inVue. So there's -- we typically do involve them when we're bringing something new to the market, new to the world like this. I think the exciting thing from their perspective is that you're looking at cellular structures, including intracellular structures within their natural state. When you prepare a slide, it's a 2D, I don't want to use the word squish, but I'll use the word you're sort of squishing it. So you're getting a non-natural look at it. When you have a three-dimensional view and can interrogate it in that natural state, you see things that you don't otherwise -- you wouldn't otherwise see and are able to provide differential diagnosis from that. So they're very excited by that. I think veterinarians, in general, are very excited by the fact that you don't have to prepare a slide. They know they spend 10 to 20 minutes on that. It's technique-sensitive, it's highly variable. Therefore, the output in interpretation is variable. So having a solution like that, that's relevant, that's something that they -- is well understood, I think they're very enthusiastic about that. With respect to innovation this year and announcing innovation, not going to talk about that. At this point, we're constantly innovating our product development pipeline, and funnel is filled with very interesting activities. And as we get closer to launch of particular assay or software or instrument, then we talk about it and then we'll disclose more. Yes. So with respect to the point-of-care platform launches. We have a very well-defined tried and true method of developing platforms, putting it in the hands of customers, getting feedback in terms of how it works within a real operating environment. We know that there's a difference between bench-top development and what you see within the clinic when we launch something and begin shipping it. We want to make sure that the average time between support events are four, five, six years. These are world-class levels of performance. And our customers expect that of us. We don't want to premature launch and maybe have issues that are disruptive to the practice environment. So we're comfortable with what we've guided to in terms of the timing of that and making sure that it fits within software ecosystem and the overall operating environment of the practice itself. We're not further disclosing our next point-of-care platform other than what we've talked in the past, we have one, it's outside of the existing testing categories, and when we get closer to launch, we'll talk about it. Yes. Our markets have been very competitive for a long time. I think new ownership hasn't really changed that dynamic. Some of our competitors were also partners with on the clinical services and equipment side. Customers have a choice. Our focus is on continuing to innovate to help address the challenging problems they have in the practice, whether it's capacity constraints, whether it's introducing new testing solutions, to give them better medical results. What we find at the end of the day is customers appreciate the integrated nature of our offering, the ability to generate seamless user-friendly, customer-friendly way these critical insights that inform great medical decisions that help produce outcomes and do it productively. That's where our focus is and that's where our focus is going to remain. Okay. Thank you. So we don't have further questions. So with that, thank you for your questions. We'll now conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. It's been a pleasure to review another quarter of strong IDEXX results. In summary, IDEXX is well positioned to sustain the momentum we've built into 2024, which will continue to help us address the significant decades-long opportunity to raise the standard of care for companion animal health care. Our consistent strategy focused on supporting increased utilization of diagnostics is a key factor in elevating the standards of care and has helped us navigate the highly dynamic external environment in our sector. We look forward to continued strong execution against our strategic priorities by teams across IDEXX as we move forward through 2024 and beyond. So thank you for your participation this morning, and we'll now conclude the call."

[Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid revenue growth and strong profit gains in the third quarter. Overall revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 9% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues net of approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer equivalent selling days.  Organic revenue growth was supported by sustained benefits from IDEXX execution drivers including continued strong premium instrument replacements, solid new business gains, high levels of customer retention and high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues.  Overall CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by a 2% same-store decline in US clinical business. This was below our expectations for relatively flattening US clinic visit trends, reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics and relatively softer wellness visit levels. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations supported by gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which enabled EPS delivery of $2.53 per share, up 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Based on our strong financial results in the quarter, we're updating our full year EPS outlook aligned with the higher end of our previous guidance range.  This reflects expectations for strong comparable operating margin gains this year. We're also updating our full year revenue guidance ranges to incorporate our Q3 results and recent sector trends, as well as to reflect the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We will review our updated guidance detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with the review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 8% organic CAG gains and 7% organic growth in our Water business. Overall, organic revenue growth was moderated by 2% organic growth in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues including effects from the wind down of our human COVID testing business.  CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, reflecting 8.3% gains in the US and 10.3% growth in international regions net of a 0.5% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 7%, in line with our expectations for 6% to 7% gains in the second half of the year.  Overall, organic revenue growth was supported by 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, driven by continued strong gains in recurring software revenues. GAC instrument revenues were down 10% organically, reflecting comparisons to high priority levels, program pricing effects and global mix.  IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 8.3%, including approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer selling days in Q3. This reflects an approximately 1100 basis point normalized growth premium, compared to same-store US clinic visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2% overall in the quarter.  IDEXX\u2019s growth results reflect continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. Instrument benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization, solid new business gains, and sustained high customer retention levels.  As noted, same-store US clinic visit declines of 2% were below our expectations for relatively flat clinic visit growth in the second half of 2023. Software trends in Q3 a period of an impacted by ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics, including effects from high staff turnover. We also saw a relative slow down in wellness visits in the quarter, which may reflect some macro impacts on demand at the clinic level.  We refined our full year revenue outlook to capture potential impacts from these trends in Q4, while reinforcing our strong outlook for 2023 profit performance. IDEXX international CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 10.3% in Q3, reflecting continued benefits from higher net price realization, and improved volume gains.  International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected and sustained new business gains and high Q3 premium instrument replacements, which supported a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset negative impacts from international macro conditions, which continue to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter.  Globally Q3 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 11% organically with double digit gains in US and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth at our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,571 CAG premium instruments in Q3, a decrease of 4% year-on-year, compared to record prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. The quality of instrument replacements continues to be excellent reflected in solid global gains in EVI metrics and sustained high new and competitive catalyst placements in the US. Global catalyst placements decreased 2% overall reflecting tough comparisons to high prior year international placement levels.  ProCyte One installed base expansion continued at a solid pace reflected in a global installed base of over 12,000 instruments. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 8% organically in Q3, supported by strong growth in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and relatively improved mid-to-high single-digit growth in International regions. In other areas of our CAG business, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and diagnostic imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 7% organically in Q3, compared to strong prior year growth levels. Growth was driven by continued solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from net price improvement. Our Tecta-PDS acquisition integration continues to progress well and added 1% to reported Water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 2% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. continue to be moderated by constraints on International growth, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by high comparable operating margin gains, including benefits from operating expense leverage. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.9%, up 30 basis points on a comparable basis, compared to strong prior year levels.  Gross margin gains reflected benefits from higher net price realization, business mix and improvement in software service gross margins. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60-basis point negative impact related to FX, driven by the lapping of prior year hedge gains. We're projecting an approximate 70 basis point gross margin headwind in Q4 related to FX, again primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year as reported and on a comparable basis, reflecting benefits from cost controls and lapping of prior year R&D and commercial investments. We're planning for a higher level of OpEx growth in Q4 as we advance our U.S. commercial expansion and increased R&D investments aligned with our innovation initiatives, including our planned 2024 new platform launch. EPS was $2.53 per share in Q3, an increase of 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $1 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of $9 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges resulted in a $1 million gain in the quarter. Free cash flow was $238 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to FCF conversion ratio was 83%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 85% to 90% of net income at the higher end of our earlier projections reflecting estimated capital spending of $160 to $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.6x net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 0.1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. We allocated $35 million in capital to share repurchases in the third quarter, as we continue to manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L guidance, we're updating our full-year outlook to incorporate our Q3 results and revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full-year guidance for reported revenues is $3,635 million to $3,650 million, reflecting a 7.9% to 8.4% reported growth range.  The updated reported revenue outlook includes a $20 million reduction for FX impacts, compared to prior estimates. We now estimate FX will reduce full-year reported growth by approximately 0.5%, with limited year-on-year revenue growth effects in Q4. In terms of our operational revenue growth outlook, we are updating our full-year organic growth guidance to 8.3% to 8.8%, supported by an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9.8% to 10.3%. This aligns with the lower end of our most recent guidance ranges in the midpoint of our original outlook for 2023.  Our organic growth guidance assumes a level of continued pressure on U.S. same-store clinical visits and International same-store sales levels in Q4 reflecting ongoing clinic capacity management dynamics and macro-economic impacts on demand.  Consistent with earlier guidance our outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflects continued solid, positive benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including consistent expectations for 6% to 7% net price improvement in the second half of 2023.  In Q4, we expect global net price improvement within this range, with U.S. net price gains of 6%, reflecting the lapping of prior year price increases. Our Q4 outlook also incorporates a 1% equivalent day volume growth headwind. We're maintaining the high end of our reported EPS outlook and narrowing the full-year EPS guidance range to $9.74 to $9.90 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share at midpoint. At midpoint we're maintaining a consistent operational EPS outlook, as revisions to our organic revenue growth range are offset by positive adjustments to our projections for operating margins incorporating our strong year-to-date performance.  We've increased the outlook for reported operating margins to 29.6% to 29.8% for the full year. This reflects an outlook for 360 to 380 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion, including approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our updated full year EPS guidance incorporates $0.11 per share in positive revisions combined to our interest expense and tax rate outlook including $0.04 in upsides related to share based compensation tax benefits. These gains are partially offset by $0.05 of negative impact from foreign exchange changes at updated rates.  We now estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by $0.25 per share for the full year and will reduce reported full year operating margins by 70 basis points including impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We've provided details on our updated 2023 outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshots. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX continued to make excellent progress in advancing our business strategy in Q3, while delivering solid organic revenue growth and strong financial performance. Our strategy of high-touch commercial engagement, supported by relevant testing and workflow innovations, drove continued adoption of IDEXX\u2019s world-class products and services.  IDEXX solutions support our customer's mission to deliver high standards of care, enabled through the continued expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization at the practice level. Diagnostics revenue remains the fastest growing area of veterinary clinic revenues, a durable trend since the determination of a patient's health status and the best treatment path very often requires testing. IDEXX\u2019s strong financial performance in Q3 was supported by solid gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across our major regions. The expansion of recurring revenues benefit from multiple IDEXX execution drivers, including solid placements of premium instruments building off high prior year levels, sustained new business gains, net price realization, and continued momentum in placements of cloud-based software solutions.  These gains are offsetting near-term headwinds in overall clinic visit levels globally reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at veterinary practices, as well as impacts from macroeconomic dynamics. Productivity remains a top priority for veterinary clinics, who continue to refine their business approach and make trade-offs necessary to balance staffing management challenges with strong demand for medical services.  IDEXX\u2019s solutions anchored by our software-enabled multi-modality offering give clinics the tools to address these dynamics. Today, I\u2019ll review how we're advancing our strategy focused on developing the significant long-term growth opportunity for our business, while delivering strong financial performance. I\u2019ll start with an update on our global commercial performance and how our focus on customer engagement supports the increase in adoption and utilization of diagnostics. IDEXX commercial teams are highly engaged in a customer-centric model that supports both existing customers' use of diagnostics and expanding our customer base. Our commercial professionals delivered another excellent quarter of results in Q3. Solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue reflects benefits from our expanding loyal installed base and our veterinary partnership model to communicate the importance of diagnostics to clinicians.  It also reflects benefits from our focus on placing high value analyzers at existing and competitive accounts in order to drive profitable future recurring revenues including 5% competitive Catalyst placement growth in North America, which supported solid EVI growth. Our continued progress on this front reflects a relentless focus on providing busy clinicians with the products, services, and the support they need to serve the high demand for veterinary services and meet the expectations of pet owners who seek and increasingly demand no compromises in the care for their pets. In addition to driving the core growth in medical services in the clinic, diagnostics are also a key profit center. Continued growth in both diagnostics frequency and utilization per clinical visit was supported by gains in wellness testing per visit, building on substantial increases through the pandemic. This demonstrates that veterinarians continue to incorporate and expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols while pet owners continue to show willingness to spend on their pets.  This focus supported solid 7% gains in same-store diagnostic revenue gain at the practice level growth that is being achieved despite ongoing headwinds in clinical visit growth in a resource constrained and challenging macro environment. This performance shows that pet owners continue to prioritize healthcare for their pets, which reinforces the resiliency of our sector. And IDEXX customers are growing even faster supported by our direct customer engagement model and superior, integrated diagnostic solutions. IDEXX\u2019s experienced sales professionals\u2019 deep partnership with the veterinarians they serve supported sector diagnostic revenue growth that outpaced both practice revenue and clinical revenue growth by 200 plus basis points in Q3 building on our strong momentum in helping to advance pet healthcare through diagnostics testing. Growing our commercial footprint in a disciplined way is a key element of our customer engagement strategy. As we shared at Investor Day, extensive practice data analysis shows that customers using our broader diagnostics offering generate approximately 200 basis points higher practice clinical and diagnostics revenue growth consistent with our execution trends. This benefits the patient, practice economics and, by extension, IDEXX.  Our U.S. commercial expansion is progressing to plan, and we expect to enter the New Year with the expanded team in place. This is the first U.S. expansion in four years, and many territories have appreciably increased in size since then. Increasing reach and engagement with clinics in our largest and most developed region prepares us well to support the growing portfolio of IDEXX innovations. Outside of the U.S., we remain focused on deploying our commercial playbook in countries across the world and are encouraged to report that third quarter International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues benefited from another quarter of improving volume growth. Higher reach-to-revenue metrics strengthen relationships between IDEXX commercial professionals and in-region veterinarians.  Our increased commercial presence as a result of seven international commercial expansions since 2020 helped drive solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our international premium instrument installed base across platforms. This includes record third quarter instrument placements in the Asia-Pacific region which helped drive 13% growth in our international installed base.  This growth demonstrates that our highly capable sales teams have the right products at the right time and reinforces significant potential associated with the development of international regions. These geographies represent an outsized portion of our long-term opportunity of over 200,000 incremental premium placements for existing instrument categories. Turning to our innovation agenda, software is a key pillar in our growth strategy and an area of important focus in the clinic, a trend that we are well positioned to facilitate and enable. Clinics are embracing software to improve efficiency in all aspects of their business, from patient processing and billing to diagnostics interpretation and pet owner communication.  Higher software adoption is driven by the desire to realize the benefits of modern technology and applications to address these significant workflow pain points. It also positions practices to incorporate solutions that increase engagement with pet owners through scheduling and other tools that they use and rely on in other aspects of their lives.  The multiplier benefit to our business from the adoption of IDEXX software is significant, reflected in third quarter growth in our software and diagnostic imaging segment with high-teen organic gains in our highly profitable recurring annuity stream. Excellent commercial execution and strong customer interest drove outstanding third quarter PIMS placements. Most notably, our cloud-based PIMS products represented 95% of total PIMS placements and as a result now comprise over 50% of our PIMS installed base. This achievement reflects broad-based adoption of cloud-based products that reflects an inflection point in technology adoption.  While veterinarians earlier in their careers are more digitally native, sales profiles indicate that customers of all career stages appreciate the workflow benefits and ease-of-use of our wide-ranging software stack. The common denominator is that contemporary software solutions allow them to better focus on the delivery of care and minimize non-value add administrative activities. Our software product offering also includes an integrated diagnostics portal, VetConnect PLUS with IDEXX DecisionIQ, that not only provides testing results, but also decision support, clinical insights, and next step considerations across a growing range of clinical use cases.  IDEXX software and data solutions situate us well to benefit from these trends, as well as the accretion in operating margin drop through associated with a revenue base that is increasingly recurring in nature. Our software innovation is deeply integrated with our diagnostics innovation approach as evidenced by our highly successful instrument platform strategy, enabled by cloud-based capabilities and connectivity that enhance practice insight and workflow.  We're very excited about our continued progress in bringing transformative solutions to point of care and we are on plan to announce our new platform at VMX in January. Our product development efforts continue to advance aligned to our timing expectations and we are excited to share more details in just a few short months and how it will add to our over 200,000 placement opportunity estimate for existing instrument categories. We also continue to advance our innovation engine in other areas like advanced test menu. Innovation in assays that provide new clinical insights earlier in disease states is especially valued by veterinarians, since they drive higher standards of care aligned with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patients.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of an important new testing assay, Cystatin B, that expands our industry leading renal portfolio and will be available in early December beginning with our North American lab networks.  This will be followed by international launches over the course of 2024. This novel marker uses IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury earlier and more definitively and is receiving broad support from key opinion leaders.  Notably, a recent article in the Journal of Internal Veterinary Medicine, co-authored by multiple International Renal Interest Society members, highlights the beneficial insights in distinguishing progressive from stable kidney disease by detecting active injury. These clinical insights represent important medical contributions and the test will be included in close to 2 million urine panels run at IDEXX reference labs in our first year post launch.  Looking forward, we will announce an additional expansion to our reference lab testing menu in Q1. In addition to these examples of product and service innovation, we continue to advance differentiated service delivery as a key element of our expansion strategy. We made a notable advancement in this area early in the third quarter when we opened our newest reference laboratory in Perth, Western Australia.  Perth is an economically vibrant city that is a five-and-a-half-hour flight from our Brisbane laboratory including a two-hour time difference making it particularly difficult to service in the past. The addition of this new lab to our global network ensures customers will receive faster turnaround times for test results, enabling them to make timely and informed decisions for their patients' well-being. IDEXX provides the only veterinary-dedicated and accredited reference laboratory network in Australia and New Zealand, so bringing this location online is an important achievement as we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value.  Expansion of our global reference lab footprint is just one way we are addressing the approximately two-thirds of our estimated TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., an area of focus. With that, I\u2019ll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call. Before we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt sympathy for everyone affected by the events in Lewiston, Maine last week. We are deeply saddened by the senseless act of violence impacting our communities. Keeping our colleagues safe, supporting each other, and providing health and well-being support is a top priority during this difficult time.  I also want to thank law enforcement and public safety personnel who are working tirelessly to keep our communities safe and medical teams who continue to aid all who have been impacted. Now, let\u2019s open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Moving first to Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nMichael Ryskin : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, I want to talk about the broader market, I mean, as you said visit trends, as you've said, the pressures remain soft from the numbers in the snapshot relatively consistent with what we expected from third-party data. So not a huge surprise there. But I think it's safe to say that it's the last thing a lot of longer than anyone is expected going into the year.  If this continues without anything that's improvement, how does this impact your long-term model and longer term expectations to the business? Already put another way, you're targeting 8.5% organic growth this year well below your 10%, long-term target and that's despite taking 7% to 8% price. So if pricing power is not there, we're not there to the same extent and volumes don't recover, I mean, what other levers do you have to offset that? \nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, good morning Mike. This is Jay. Just a couple things, maybe at a higher level and I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian talk about some of the specifics related to the model. Keep in mind the backdrop of the sector is very positive. It's just been an expanded pet population. I think the human health and pet pop has very, very strong.  Our execution drivers as a company the things that you know, we can directly influence have been very strong. We've seen that in instrument placements and in PIMS placements, net retention, pricing realization. So all those things I think are very good. We think there's been very good end-customer demand as we cited. There are some constraints related to practice capacity and some challenges there.  I think the good news on that front is the practices have hired their baby some yeah, some additional charts that they're working through, but they're investing heavily and in technology, we see that with the use of our lab equipment, both in-clinic, as well as reference labs. And obviously, the appetite for software and applications that help them with optimized workflow have continued to grow.  And then overall, our competitive position is very strong and we think as a result of our innovation pipeline, we will continue to be strong enough for some differentiated advantages. So, I think from an industry standpoint, it's a very positive story. I think we're well positioned to capitalize on those trends and the practices just continued to work through some of the constraints we cited. \nBrian McKeon: Yeah, Mike, just to reinforce Jay's points, I think our long-term 10% growth potential, the key drivers that that we look towards we see a lot of positive factors sustaining in terms of our competitive positioning, expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization. The adoption of IDEXX technology is the long-term demand dynamics that we see associated with expanded population, and favorable demographics in terms of pet ownership.  So, all those factors are positive. I think the thing that we're working through is a combination of near-term capacity management challenges at the clinics. And I think that's something we're assisting with and, and believe we'll have solutions to help with that over time. But that is something that is has continued and I think is a factor impacting near term growth, as well as some of the near term macro impacts.  So I think, as we stated many times in the past, we're a business that's very resilient, but not immune to those types of impacts. And that's something that that I think is also impacting our near-term growth at the margin. But we don't see that either of those factors as being long-term constraints to the growth potential for the company.  And I think from a competitive positioning point of view, we're in a strong position as we've ever been in terms of our ability to support the continued expansion of the sector globally. \nMichael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And maybe I'll use my follow-up to just be a little bit more direct on \u201824. I know you're not guiding for \u201824. I'm not asking for \u201824 guide. But just looking at where consensus is right now, it is still at that roughly 10% number. Just given what we see about market conditions, as we sit today, I mean, in November, we've already got a pretty good sense of where they are.  Do you think that there's a risk that \u201824 - 2024 is also below that long-term trend line \u2013 that long term model? \nJay Mazelsky : We're not going to be guiding obviously today, but I think we've got a number of positive factors that we see heading into next year in terms of our execution. The competitive position that I noted the innovation pipeline that we're looking forward to sharing more on as we move forward. And I think those are all things that we will be leaning on to continue to delivering solid growth and continue delivering strong financial performance, which I think we're demonstrating our ability to do this year. So we'll share more in that front as we get into next year.  We're focusing on the drivers that we have direct impact on and we feel very good about our execution on that front. \nMichael Ryskin : Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah. \nBrian McKeon: We do. \nJay Mazelsky : Good morning, Nate. \nNathan Rich: Great. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to ask about the, the US CAG Diagnostic recurring performance in the third quarter and maybe just if you could go into a little bit more detail on how that played out relative to expectations? Obviously, traffic decelerated during the quarter, but from a diagnostic volume standpoint, I'd wonder if you can maybe, was there anything from a category standpoint that was more challenging than you had expected? And I'll stop there and then maybe ask my follow up next. \nBrian McKeon: Yeah. The performance in the quarter just to reinforce some of the metrics I shared, and then Jay can expand on this was our execution dimensions were very much in line with what we expected. The difference here was we are planning for flattening clinical visit trends and they were down 2% in the quarter. We did see some softening through the quarter and it was relatively more on the wellness side.  So I think that that was \u2013 that\u2019s a smaller part of the overall testing volume. But that is something that we did see relative impacts, so that that was - it was the visit trend that was different than we had been planning for or hoping for. And the execution metrics held up well and that enabled us to deliver solid growth on a - in terms of the CAG recurring revenues. \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, couple additional about comments for - to cover. We always start with PIM customer demand and for what we've seen in the talking with our customers that this good end-market demand certainly pet owners continue to prioritize and against the whole other spending categories, they're bringing their bring their pets to the veterinarian and making sure that they get the care that they need.  The other piece that we've been spending time, looking at is just overall employment levels within the practice and we think that that has increased and that's in a good position. We don't necessarily have insights in terms of how many hours they may be working to put in terms of just availability of staff within practices we think that's been reasonably good shape.  We have done some qualitative surveying. There is some additional churn within practices if that goes from practice to practice, that is obviously something that will work its way through the system. Just picking up what Brian mentioned against not to not wellness or sick patient visits versus the wellness visits, if the diagnostics usage on the non-wellness side is higher, it's much higher at 70% or so I think we map that out as part of the Investor Day.  And so, that's, I think an important tailwind for the business. The other thing that I would point out is the, relative frequency and utilization of diagnostics continues to grow within the practice we've seen that in the US, we think that's a very positive trend. Obviously, veterinarians see the importance of core medical services and to be able to treat a patient they very often have done the first test.  So it's great to see that those trends have held up and continue to grow and we think that's a strong positive. \nNathan Rich: And if I could just ask on margins, I guess, if you see sort of the visit pressure persist, just the ability to kind of grow margins in line with the kind of 50 to 100 basis point kind of constant currency range into next year, if you do see an overall kind of softer top-line environment, just, I'm curious on kind of how much kind of leverage - how much of the margin expansion is dependent on that, that top-line growth? Thank you. \nJay Mazelsky : I think we've been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform well in that front in despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So I think our updated outlook for margins if you take out the, if you normalize for the customer credit that we've highlighted, as well as the lapping of R&D and foreign exchange, we're most recent guidance is to be 80 to 100 BPS above the prior year.  And that's despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So, we've consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver to business model, which we have a number of favorable dynamics that support that we highlighted the strong growth in the software business as it is a positive driver force as we grow and I think we've got investments that we can leverage. And we've got new innovation coming to market.  So a number of factors that I think will help us and positions well to keep building on that's strong margin delivery trends. \nNathan Rich: Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will move next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nErin Wright: Hey, thanks. Has there been any early testing on the new platform you plan to launch at BMX? And if so, like what's the initial feedback and on the second platform technology, is that on track as we'll both roll out in 2024 or will both have material contributions in 2024? Thanks. \nJay Mazelsky : Yes. Good morning, Erin. I am not going to talk about the new platform other than just to reiterate we are looking forward is just a couple months away from BMX and we can talk more about that. More generally speaking the way the new product development process works is, you develop prototypes, you put it in hands of customers, they provide feedback and it goes through an additive process, you get ready to go to marketplace.  So we're excited. We think it's a - we think it's a platform that will make will have the right clinical and business contribution, but really I can't go into additional details beyond that. \nErin Wright: Okay. And, thinking about \u2013 I know this is kind of a broader question, just thinking about the competitive landscape and you have this unique positioning now seeing lessened comfort than your closest peers in both point-of-care and reference lab, particularly in the US. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about your ability to take share?  Could this accelerate particularly with also new innovation, but with any disruption associated with the other models of your peers? And how are you capitalizing on this now? And how are you taking advantage of maybe the competitive landscape where it stands today? \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, so, a couple maybe high level points and I'll get more specific. Our strategic and innovation approach is really to bring an integrated solution set to the marketplace. So that's in clinic, as well as reference lab, and the connectivity and workflow optimization provided by our software suite, we think is highly differentiated.  It supports what the practices are trying to accomplish in terms of improved standards of care, optimizations of staff productivity, client communications, all of those important things and we continue to innovate through menu expansion and then more specifically, new platforms. And new platforms, it's an important component of our business model in terms of really being able to give our customers reference lab quality testing capability within the practice.  We place it, we tend to place these through marketing programs. IDEXX360 being the primary one customers are able to get that get that placement then you use reference labs or rapid assay or our Software-as-a-Service based PIMS systems, as part of our dollar volume commitment. So there's a significant multiplier impact when you come out with new innovations.  And we just continue to build it through what technology for life philosophy. So we have existing platforms on the marketplace. We will continue to innovate with new slides, for example in chemistry or lots and lots of other examples.  We call antigen within the reference labs. So that becomes more valuable clinically over time and customers use more of it as they grow, we grow. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just had two questions for me. I guess, just coming back to the dynamics with the visit trends that we're seeing versus your expectations, is it possible to tease out how much of what you're seeing right now is macro versus how much is capacity?  So, as I'm showing my hands around, is this a situation where we're right now seeing some macro pressures and capacity just isn't getting better relative to where maybe you stood at mid-year or are we also seeing some setbacks on the vet capacity side as well as we think about the updated guidance? And then I just have one follow-up from there. \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah. Good morning, Chris. We think it's primarily capacity, it continues to be capacity. I think practices are definitely working through that. We've seen a number of things that practices have done. And the - it takes time. I mean they're making investments. So I think they're investing in their staff, as well as technology, they've hired.  They're also just trying to balance the work life balance of their teams, so that they don't lose folks and make sure that it could be stabilized. So I think that's important. We do think at the margin there could be some macro impacts than we've seen in wellness. And I would just also point out that the wellness pieces are relatively lower use intensity-wise of diagnostics.  70% of diagnostic, 70 plus percent of diagnostics are consumed through non-wellness or the sick patient visits. \nBrian McKeon: And Chris, just it's a, it's a great question. I think we've always said that the \u2013 in terms of macro where we might see it is on the wellness side where that may be more of a discretionary choice for the pet owner. Interestingly, well, the visits were down in wellness quarter frequency and utilization of diagnostics per wellness as it was up actually stronger than non-wellness.  So, for the pet owners that are able to come in and get their pets in, they're actually doing more diagnostics testing, but overall, we saw lower levels of wellness visits. So it doesn't had probably comingled into some of the dynamics that are going on with capacity management. And there may be a level of impact there.  We have seen that in international markets that we've been highlighting as we go. And so it's something that we're paying attention for. We're planning appropriately for it, but I think it's as Jay pointed out. I think - we think this is continues to be more of an impact from the ongoing ability of the practices to staff and be able to manage the demand that they're facing. \nChris Schott: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. And just a second question was just I think you mentioned a little bit about US versus international. Could you just kind of bigger picture, are you seeing noticeable differences in terms of what's happening in the US versus in the pure international markets? And just, as part of that, is this guidance update, kind of assuming a global impact in terms of visit slowdowns? Or is this skewing more US versus international? Thank you. \nBrian McKeon: We definitely saw more of an impact internationally on from macro pressures really starting at the end of 2021. And I would say that that has normalized over time and it\u2019s now relatively more in line with the US trends. We've done quite well internationally. We're doing - benefiting from our premium instrument installed base expansions, so that really helps our growth rate.  And we highlighted this quarter, we've seen actually for a few quarters now relative improvement in the volume trends. So, I think the - it's more in line I think with what we're seeing and started some of the US pressures more recently. And it does seem to be normalizing and relatively improving. You can see that in some of the international metrics things like with our reference lab growth was improved in Q3.  So that's a positive trend and we're just being realistic about the macro backdrop that we're facing and planning appropriately. \nJay Mazelsky : And keep in mind, the international sectors just a bit different in terms of its overall characteristics. It tends to be more of a sick patient roll out testing approach from a veterinary practice standpoint. So, obviously, that that's an area of richer diagnostics usage scenario, less sensitive to some of the discretionary spend that you may see in a difficult macro environment. So, as Brian said, we're happy with our progress and continues to improve we think that the team is executing extremely well, and the opportunity over time is very substantial. \nChris Schott: Thank you. \nOperator: Well go next to John Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nJohn Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. Brian, maybe just to start with you. The 3Q \u201823 sales and marketing expense was down by 3% to 4% Q-over-Q. I've got usually like flat to slightly up 2Q two to 3Q. And this year's decline was despite ongoing increases that you guys have called out on the commercial investment.  So, I don\u2019t know, I'm guessing aspects may have played a little bit of a role Q-over-Q this year in 2023, but anything to highlight on what costs you were able to take out in the S&M side that drove the sequential decline? What you were able to do or lean on even in light of the commercial investments that seem to be ongoing through the end of the year? \nBrian McKeon: Yeah, John. It's principally a lapping dynamic. We - last year in Q3 had some relatively higher sales and bidding costs. Specifically, there's some discreet costs on both the sales and marketing and the R&D side that we\u2019re lapping. And so, it - as I noted in our outlook, we're expecting a relatively higher level of OpEx growth in Q4. So it it's more related to this year-on-year specific factor dynamic. \nJohn Block: Okay. Sorry. Just my question was sequentially not year-over-year. So my apologies. The 2Q to 3Q was down 3% to 4%. It's usually up 1%. You're making commercial investments. I guess what I'm \u2013 just trying to get a little bit is like managing the bottom-line in the near-term and getting the EPS and we're exceeding the EPS number. Were there anything in sales and marketing that you scale back on in light of the lighter revenue number? Again, Q-over-Q, no. \nBrian McKeon: No, you have - there's typically some variation and cost quarter-to-quarter that that are unrelated to things like staffing. So we haven't scaled back on anything. \nJohn Block: Okay. And then, maybe just to shift to your second question. I'm going to show my age and flashback to set of you, initially you guys expected, I think it was three to six thousand in consumable revenue per box on set of you. I get it a couple quarters in that forecast came down at 3,000 to 4,500, maybe you can just talk about how that eventually shook out, as that product cycle matured?  And in any comments on the IDEXX in view trademark, which hit last week, it seems like to us that's probably the BMX analyzer and then how to think about the revs per box on the new system. Thanks. \nBrian McKeon: So on set of you, if I got your question right, the the utilization per placement played out actually quite very much in line with what we expected. So I think we haven\u2019t updated that for a bit, but I think that that was tracked consistently in line with our original estimate since sustained over time. So I think that that has been on track to our estimates.  And it's, it's pretty much sure for us to get into the specifics on the, on the new instrument launch. We'll look forward to sharing more on that next year. Just to reinforce, these, as you know, these types of platforms build over time really the biggest effects from them are that they open the door for conversation with veterinarians to talk about IDEXX technology and innovations and adopt them in their practice.  And so we're very excited about building on the momentum when we had from ProCyte One to continue those dialogues and deepen our relationships with our customers help them grow faster. And we'll share more on the specifics relating to new innovations as we get into next year. \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, John, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think we shared some data through went up like Ericson presented on the evolution of menu and how that that impacts the overall economic value over time. And our technology for life approach where we come \u2013 we come out to the marketplace. We introduce product obviously. The installed base grows over time. But as we continue to add menu and improve that, more revenue, more economics are generated. And we've been able to demonstrate that through our platforms including the reference labs. \nJohn Block: Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll move next to Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nBrandon Vasquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First one maybe just follow-up maybe ask on some of the headwinds in the quarter slightly different there's wellness and there's a little bit of labor. The question I want to ask is, are those getting, are they deteriorating are those headwinds increasing as we go into the end of the year? I guess, I'm trying to ask for a little clarification, are things stable, maybe just not improving as much as we thought? Or are we going into year end with those two dynamics kind of worsening a little bit? \nBrian McKeon: I think it the key change here relative to what we expected to happen in the quarter was, we're looking for flattening visit trends in the US, and they came in at minus 2%. So if you go fundamentally, it was different than what we expected, that's it. But I think our execution was strong and all those dimensions going to play the way that we had hoped. The clinic - US clinical visit trends were minus 1% in Q2 - excuse me, in Q2, and minus 2% in Q3 on a two year basis. They're pretty similar. I think it's a, we did see some relative softening through the quarter. Some relative relatively weaker wellness clinical visit trends, more at the margin I think the bigger, bigger story here was, we had hoped that we had worked through the pullback effects on capacity. And we see some normalization there and I think we're still working through some of the management dynamics. So that that is very much reflected in our or balance year outlook that we've calibrated for that appropriately while we're reinforcing our profit delivery. So I think we're able to manage that well and teams are executing very well. And then again excited about a number of the things that we've got going into next year relative to our positioning as a company and new innovation bringing a market. And look forward to continuing to solid growth in that context. \nJay Mazelsky : Yeah, and keep in mind, the expanded pet population has been very, very substantial. So, we know that the end-customer demand is there. There is a lot of interest I think that to Brian\u2019s point as we work through that capacity at the clinic level. There's unmet unserved demand out there. \nBrandon Vasquez: Okay, great. And maybe as a follow-up, you guys are expanding US sales force now that seems on track as we go into \u201924. Can you just talk about expectations? How long does it take to get those new reps trained? You'll probably also have a new innovative product for them next year a new system. So what's the timeline to kind of start seeing leverage both sales and kind of margin benefits from the expanded sales force? Thank you. \nJay Mazelsky : This is something that we've been we've been doing for a long time. I think we have a very successful formula in terms of how we how we expand the overall commercial ecosystem and footprint in North America. It tends to be a relatively short time to ramp. We have I think a - protective training approach and when we bring new folks into the system, they're well trained. And they really come up to speed within quarters.  Now they continue to become more productive over time, but this they get a lot of support through professional service vets and the field service representatives. The entire ecosystem is there to support them.  Okay. Thank you for your questions. We'll not conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. before we end today's call. I'd like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for delivering another quarter of strong execution against our organic growth strategy. Our sector remains very dynamic and your steadfast commitment to providing a better future for animals, people and our planet has helped us maintain momentum and deliver strong results.  Not only have you delivered today in the third quarter, but your efforts position us well to continue to develop our sector and support our customers well into the future. Well, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being, the pets, people and livestock. So now we'll conclude the call. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid revenue growth and strong profit gains in the third quarter. Overall revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 9% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues net of approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer equivalent selling days.  Organic revenue growth was supported by sustained benefits from IDEXX execution drivers including continued strong premium instrument replacements, solid new business gains, high levels of customer retention and high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues.  Overall CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by a 2% same-store decline in US clinical business. This was below our expectations for relatively flattening US clinic visit trends, reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics and relatively softer wellness visit levels. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations supported by gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which enabled EPS delivery of $2.53 per share, up 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Based on our strong financial results in the quarter, we're updating our full year EPS outlook aligned with the higher end of our previous guidance range.  This reflects expectations for strong comparable operating margin gains this year. We're also updating our full year revenue guidance ranges to incorporate our Q3 results and recent sector trends, as well as to reflect the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We will review our updated guidance detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with the review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 8% organic CAG gains and 7% organic growth in our Water business. Overall, organic revenue growth was moderated by 2% organic growth in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues including effects from the wind down of our human COVID testing business.  CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, reflecting 8.3% gains in the US and 10.3% growth in international regions net of a 0.5% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 7%, in line with our expectations for 6% to 7% gains in the second half of the year.  Overall, organic revenue growth was supported by 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, driven by continued strong gains in recurring software revenues. GAC instrument revenues were down 10% organically, reflecting comparisons to high priority levels, program pricing effects and global mix.  IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 8.3%, including approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer selling days in Q3. This reflects an approximately 1100 basis point normalized growth premium, compared to same-store US clinic visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2% overall in the quarter.  IDEXX's growth results reflect continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. Instrument benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization, solid new business gains, and sustained high customer retention levels.  As noted, same-store US clinic visit declines of 2% were below our expectations for relatively flat clinic visit growth in the second half of 2023. Software trends in Q3 a period of an impacted by ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics, including effects from high staff turnover. We also saw a relative slow down in wellness visits in the quarter, which may reflect some macro impacts on demand at the clinic level.  We refined our full year revenue outlook to capture potential impacts from these trends in Q4, while reinforcing our strong outlook for 2023 profit performance. IDEXX international CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 10.3% in Q3, reflecting continued benefits from higher net price realization, and improved volume gains.  International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected and sustained new business gains and high Q3 premium instrument replacements, which supported a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset negative impacts from international macro conditions, which continue to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter.  Globally Q3 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 11% organically with double digit gains in US and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth at our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,571 CAG premium instruments in Q3, a decrease of 4% year-on-year, compared to record prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. The quality of instrument replacements continues to be excellent reflected in solid global gains in EVI metrics and sustained high new and competitive catalyst placements in the US. Global catalyst placements decreased 2% overall reflecting tough comparisons to high prior year international placement levels.  ProCyte One installed base expansion continued at a solid pace reflected in a global installed base of over 12,000 instruments. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 8% organically in Q3, supported by strong growth in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and relatively improved mid-to-high single-digit growth in International regions. In other areas of our CAG business, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and diagnostic imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 7% organically in Q3, compared to strong prior year growth levels. Growth was driven by continued solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from net price improvement. Our Tecta-PDS acquisition integration continues to progress well and added 1% to reported Water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 2% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. continue to be moderated by constraints on International growth, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by high comparable operating margin gains, including benefits from operating expense leverage. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.9%, up 30 basis points on a comparable basis, compared to strong prior year levels.  Gross margin gains reflected benefits from higher net price realization, business mix and improvement in software service gross margins. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60-basis point negative impact related to FX, driven by the lapping of prior year hedge gains. We're projecting an approximate 70 basis point gross margin headwind in Q4 related to FX, again primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year as reported and on a comparable basis, reflecting benefits from cost controls and lapping of prior year R&D and commercial investments. We're planning for a higher level of OpEx growth in Q4 as we advance our U.S. commercial expansion and increased R&D investments aligned with our innovation initiatives, including our planned 2024 new platform launch. EPS was $2.53 per share in Q3, an increase of 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $1 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of $9 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges resulted in a $1 million gain in the quarter. Free cash flow was $238 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to FCF conversion ratio was 83%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 85% to 90% of net income at the higher end of our earlier projections reflecting estimated capital spending of $160 to $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.6x net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 0.1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. We allocated $35 million in capital to share repurchases in the third quarter, as we continue to manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L guidance, we're updating our full-year outlook to incorporate our Q3 results and revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full-year guidance for reported revenues is $3,635 million to $3,650 million, reflecting a 7.9% to 8.4% reported growth range.  The updated reported revenue outlook includes a $20 million reduction for FX impacts, compared to prior estimates. We now estimate FX will reduce full-year reported growth by approximately 0.5%, with limited year-on-year revenue growth effects in Q4. In terms of our operational revenue growth outlook, we are updating our full-year organic growth guidance to 8.3% to 8.8%, supported by an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9.8% to 10.3%. This aligns with the lower end of our most recent guidance ranges in the midpoint of our original outlook for 2023.  Our organic growth guidance assumes a level of continued pressure on U.S. same-store clinical visits and International same-store sales levels in Q4 reflecting ongoing clinic capacity management dynamics and macro-economic impacts on demand.  Consistent with earlier guidance our outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflects continued solid, positive benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including consistent expectations for 6% to 7% net price improvement in the second half of 2023.  In Q4, we expect global net price improvement within this range, with U.S. net price gains of 6%, reflecting the lapping of prior year price increases. Our Q4 outlook also incorporates a 1% equivalent day volume growth headwind. We're maintaining the high end of our reported EPS outlook and narrowing the full-year EPS guidance range to $9.74 to $9.90 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share at midpoint. At midpoint we're maintaining a consistent operational EPS outlook, as revisions to our organic revenue growth range are offset by positive adjustments to our projections for operating margins incorporating our strong year-to-date performance.  We've increased the outlook for reported operating margins to 29.6% to 29.8% for the full year. This reflects an outlook for 360 to 380 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion, including approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our updated full year EPS guidance incorporates $0.11 per share in positive revisions combined to our interest expense and tax rate outlook including $0.04 in upsides related to share based compensation tax benefits. These gains are partially offset by $0.05 of negative impact from foreign exchange changes at updated rates.  We now estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by $0.25 per share for the full year and will reduce reported full year operating margins by 70 basis points including impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We've provided details on our updated 2023 outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshots. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Yeah, Mike, just to reinforce Jay's points, I think our long-term 10% growth potential, the key drivers that that we look towards we see a lot of positive factors sustaining in terms of our competitive positioning, expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization. The adoption of IDEXX technology is the long-term demand dynamics that we see associated with expanded population, and favorable demographics in terms of pet ownership.  So, all those factors are positive. I think the thing that we're working through is a combination of near-term capacity management challenges at the clinics. And I think that's something we're assisting with and, and believe we'll have solutions to help with that over time. But that is something that is has continued and I think is a factor impacting near term growth, as well as some of the near term macro impacts.  So I think, as we stated many times in the past, we're a business that's very resilient, but not immune to those types of impacts. And that's something that that I think is also impacting our near-term growth at the margin. But we don't see that either of those factors as being long-term constraints to the growth potential for the company.  And I think from a competitive positioning point of view, we're in a strong position as we've ever been in terms of our ability to support the continued expansion of the sector globally. We do. Yeah. The performance in the quarter just to reinforce some of the metrics I shared, and then Jay can expand on this was our execution dimensions were very much in line with what we expected. The difference here was we are planning for flattening clinical visit trends and they were down 2% in the quarter. We did see some softening through the quarter and it was relatively more on the wellness side.  So I think that that was \u2013 that's a smaller part of the overall testing volume. But that is something that we did see relative impacts, so that that was - it was the visit trend that was different than we had been planning for or hoping for. And the execution metrics held up well and that enabled us to deliver solid growth on a - in terms of the CAG recurring revenues. And Chris, just it's a, it's a great question. I think we've always said that the \u2013 in terms of macro where we might see it is on the wellness side where that may be more of a discretionary choice for the pet owner. Interestingly, well, the visits were down in wellness quarter frequency and utilization of diagnostics per wellness as it was up actually stronger than non-wellness.  So, for the pet owners that are able to come in and get their pets in, they're actually doing more diagnostics testing, but overall, we saw lower levels of wellness visits. So it doesn't had probably comingled into some of the dynamics that are going on with capacity management. And there may be a level of impact there.  We have seen that in international markets that we've been highlighting as we go. And so it's something that we're paying attention for. We're planning appropriately for it, but I think it's as Jay pointed out. I think - we think this is continues to be more of an impact from the ongoing ability of the practices to staff and be able to manage the demand that they're facing. We definitely saw more of an impact internationally on from macro pressures really starting at the end of 2021. And I would say that that has normalized over time and it's now relatively more in line with the US trends. We've done quite well internationally. We're doing - benefiting from our premium instrument installed base expansions, so that really helps our growth rate.  And we highlighted this quarter, we've seen actually for a few quarters now relative improvement in the volume trends. So, I think the - it's more in line I think with what we're seeing and started some of the US pressures more recently. And it does seem to be normalizing and relatively improving. You can see that in some of the international metrics things like with our reference lab growth was improved in Q3.  So that's a positive trend and we're just being realistic about the macro backdrop that we're facing and planning appropriately. Yeah, John. It's principally a lapping dynamic. We - last year in Q3 had some relatively higher sales and bidding costs. Specifically, there's some discreet costs on both the sales and marketing and the R&D side that we're lapping. And so, it - as I noted in our outlook, we're expecting a relatively higher level of OpEx growth in Q4. So it it's more related to this year-on-year specific factor dynamic. No, you have - there's typically some variation and cost quarter-to-quarter that that are unrelated to things like staffing. So we haven't scaled back on anything. So on set of you, if I got your question right, the the utilization per placement played out actually quite very much in line with what we expected. So I think we haven't updated that for a bit, but I think that that was tracked consistently in line with our original estimate since sustained over time. So I think that that has been on track to our estimates.  And it's, it's pretty much sure for us to get into the specifics on the, on the new instrument launch. We'll look forward to sharing more on that next year. Just to reinforce, these, as you know, these types of platforms build over time really the biggest effects from them are that they open the door for conversation with veterinarians to talk about IDEXX technology and innovations and adopt them in their practice.  And so we're very excited about building on the momentum when we had from ProCyte One to continue those dialogues and deepen our relationships with our customers help them grow faster. And we'll share more on the specifics relating to new innovations as we get into next year. I think it the key change here relative to what we expected to happen in the quarter was, we're looking for flattening visit trends in the US, and they came in at minus 2%. So if you go fundamentally, it was different than what we expected, that's it. But I think our execution was strong and all those dimensions going to play the way that we had hoped. The clinic - US clinical visit trends were minus 1% in Q2 - excuse me, in Q2, and minus 2% in Q3 on a two year basis. They're pretty similar. I think it's a, we did see some relative softening through the quarter. Some relative relatively weaker wellness clinical visit trends, more at the margin I think the bigger, bigger story here was, we had hoped that we had worked through the pullback effects on capacity. And we see some normalization there and I think we're still working through some of the management dynamics. So that that is very much reflected in our or balance year outlook that we've calibrated for that appropriately while we're reinforcing our profit delivery. So I think we're able to manage that well and teams are executing very well. And then again excited about a number of the things that we've got going into next year relative to our positioning as a company and new innovation bringing a market. And look forward to continuing to solid growth in that context."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX continued to make excellent progress in advancing our business strategy in Q3, while delivering solid organic revenue growth and strong financial performance. Our strategy of high-touch commercial engagement, supported by relevant testing and workflow innovations, drove continued adoption of IDEXX's world-class products and services.  IDEXX solutions support our customer's mission to deliver high standards of care, enabled through the continued expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization at the practice level. Diagnostics revenue remains the fastest growing area of veterinary clinic revenues, a durable trend since the determination of a patient's health status and the best treatment path very often requires testing. IDEXX's strong financial performance in Q3 was supported by solid gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across our major regions. The expansion of recurring revenues benefit from multiple IDEXX execution drivers, including solid placements of premium instruments building off high prior year levels, sustained new business gains, net price realization, and continued momentum in placements of cloud-based software solutions.  These gains are offsetting near-term headwinds in overall clinic visit levels globally reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at veterinary practices, as well as impacts from macroeconomic dynamics. Productivity remains a top priority for veterinary clinics, who continue to refine their business approach and make trade-offs necessary to balance staffing management challenges with strong demand for medical services.  IDEXX's solutions anchored by our software-enabled multi-modality offering give clinics the tools to address these dynamics. Today, I'll review how we're advancing our strategy focused on developing the significant long-term growth opportunity for our business, while delivering strong financial performance. I'll start with an update on our global commercial performance and how our focus on customer engagement supports the increase in adoption and utilization of diagnostics. IDEXX commercial teams are highly engaged in a customer-centric model that supports both existing customers' use of diagnostics and expanding our customer base. Our commercial professionals delivered another excellent quarter of results in Q3. Solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue reflects benefits from our expanding loyal installed base and our veterinary partnership model to communicate the importance of diagnostics to clinicians.  It also reflects benefits from our focus on placing high value analyzers at existing and competitive accounts in order to drive profitable future recurring revenues including 5% competitive Catalyst placement growth in North America, which supported solid EVI growth. Our continued progress on this front reflects a relentless focus on providing busy clinicians with the products, services, and the support they need to serve the high demand for veterinary services and meet the expectations of pet owners who seek and increasingly demand no compromises in the care for their pets. In addition to driving the core growth in medical services in the clinic, diagnostics are also a key profit center. Continued growth in both diagnostics frequency and utilization per clinical visit was supported by gains in wellness testing per visit, building on substantial increases through the pandemic. This demonstrates that veterinarians continue to incorporate and expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols while pet owners continue to show willingness to spend on their pets.  This focus supported solid 7% gains in same-store diagnostic revenue gain at the practice level growth that is being achieved despite ongoing headwinds in clinical visit growth in a resource constrained and challenging macro environment. This performance shows that pet owners continue to prioritize healthcare for their pets, which reinforces the resiliency of our sector. And IDEXX customers are growing even faster supported by our direct customer engagement model and superior, integrated diagnostic solutions. IDEXX's experienced sales professionals' deep partnership with the veterinarians they serve supported sector diagnostic revenue growth that outpaced both practice revenue and clinical revenue growth by 200 plus basis points in Q3 building on our strong momentum in helping to advance pet healthcare through diagnostics testing. Growing our commercial footprint in a disciplined way is a key element of our customer engagement strategy. As we shared at Investor Day, extensive practice data analysis shows that customers using our broader diagnostics offering generate approximately 200 basis points higher practice clinical and diagnostics revenue growth consistent with our execution trends. This benefits the patient, practice economics and, by extension, IDEXX.  Our U.S. commercial expansion is progressing to plan, and we expect to enter the New Year with the expanded team in place. This is the first U.S. expansion in four years, and many territories have appreciably increased in size since then. Increasing reach and engagement with clinics in our largest and most developed region prepares us well to support the growing portfolio of IDEXX innovations. Outside of the U.S., we remain focused on deploying our commercial playbook in countries across the world and are encouraged to report that third quarter International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues benefited from another quarter of improving volume growth. Higher reach-to-revenue metrics strengthen relationships between IDEXX commercial professionals and in-region veterinarians.  Our increased commercial presence as a result of seven international commercial expansions since 2020 helped drive solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our international premium instrument installed base across platforms. This includes record third quarter instrument placements in the Asia-Pacific region which helped drive 13% growth in our international installed base.  This growth demonstrates that our highly capable sales teams have the right products at the right time and reinforces significant potential associated with the development of international regions. These geographies represent an outsized portion of our long-term opportunity of over 200,000 incremental premium placements for existing instrument categories. Turning to our innovation agenda, software is a key pillar in our growth strategy and an area of important focus in the clinic, a trend that we are well positioned to facilitate and enable. Clinics are embracing software to improve efficiency in all aspects of their business, from patient processing and billing to diagnostics interpretation and pet owner communication.  Higher software adoption is driven by the desire to realize the benefits of modern technology and applications to address these significant workflow pain points. It also positions practices to incorporate solutions that increase engagement with pet owners through scheduling and other tools that they use and rely on in other aspects of their lives.  The multiplier benefit to our business from the adoption of IDEXX software is significant, reflected in third quarter growth in our software and diagnostic imaging segment with high-teen organic gains in our highly profitable recurring annuity stream. Excellent commercial execution and strong customer interest drove outstanding third quarter PIMS placements. Most notably, our cloud-based PIMS products represented 95% of total PIMS placements and as a result now comprise over 50% of our PIMS installed base. This achievement reflects broad-based adoption of cloud-based products that reflects an inflection point in technology adoption.  While veterinarians earlier in their careers are more digitally native, sales profiles indicate that customers of all career stages appreciate the workflow benefits and ease-of-use of our wide-ranging software stack. The common denominator is that contemporary software solutions allow them to better focus on the delivery of care and minimize non-value add administrative activities. Our software product offering also includes an integrated diagnostics portal, VetConnect PLUS with IDEXX DecisionIQ, that not only provides testing results, but also decision support, clinical insights, and next step considerations across a growing range of clinical use cases.  IDEXX software and data solutions situate us well to benefit from these trends, as well as the accretion in operating margin drop through associated with a revenue base that is increasingly recurring in nature. Our software innovation is deeply integrated with our diagnostics innovation approach as evidenced by our highly successful instrument platform strategy, enabled by cloud-based capabilities and connectivity that enhance practice insight and workflow.  We're very excited about our continued progress in bringing transformative solutions to point of care and we are on plan to announce our new platform at VMX in January. Our product development efforts continue to advance aligned to our timing expectations and we are excited to share more details in just a few short months and how it will add to our over 200,000 placement opportunity estimate for existing instrument categories. We also continue to advance our innovation engine in other areas like advanced test menu. Innovation in assays that provide new clinical insights earlier in disease states is especially valued by veterinarians, since they drive higher standards of care aligned with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patients.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of an important new testing assay, Cystatin B, that expands our industry leading renal portfolio and will be available in early December beginning with our North American lab networks.  This will be followed by international launches over the course of 2024. This novel marker uses IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury earlier and more definitively and is receiving broad support from key opinion leaders.  Notably, a recent article in the Journal of Internal Veterinary Medicine, co-authored by multiple International Renal Interest Society members, highlights the beneficial insights in distinguishing progressive from stable kidney disease by detecting active injury. These clinical insights represent important medical contributions and the test will be included in close to 2 million urine panels run at IDEXX reference labs in our first year post launch.  Looking forward, we will announce an additional expansion to our reference lab testing menu in Q1. In addition to these examples of product and service innovation, we continue to advance differentiated service delivery as a key element of our expansion strategy. We made a notable advancement in this area early in the third quarter when we opened our newest reference laboratory in Perth, Western Australia.  Perth is an economically vibrant city that is a five-and-a-half-hour flight from our Brisbane laboratory including a two-hour time difference making it particularly difficult to service in the past. The addition of this new lab to our global network ensures customers will receive faster turnaround times for test results, enabling them to make timely and informed decisions for their patients' well-being. IDEXX provides the only veterinary-dedicated and accredited reference laboratory network in Australia and New Zealand, so bringing this location online is an important achievement as we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value.  Expansion of our global reference lab footprint is just one way we are addressing the approximately two-thirds of our estimated TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., an area of focus. With that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call. Before we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt sympathy for everyone affected by the events in Lewiston, Maine last week. We are deeply saddened by the senseless act of violence impacting our communities. Keeping our colleagues safe, supporting each other, and providing health and well-being support is a top priority during this difficult time.  I also want to thank law enforcement and public safety personnel who are working tirelessly to keep our communities safe and medical teams who continue to aid all who have been impacted. Now, let's open the line for Q&A. Yeah, good morning Mike. This is Jay. Just a couple things, maybe at a higher level and I'll turn it over to Brian talk about some of the specifics related to the model. Keep in mind the backdrop of the sector is very positive. It's just been an expanded pet population. I think the human health and pet pop has very, very strong.  Our execution drivers as a company the things that you know, we can directly influence have been very strong. We've seen that in instrument placements and in PIMS placements, net retention, pricing realization. So all those things I think are very good. We think there's been very good end-customer demand as we cited. There are some constraints related to practice capacity and some challenges there.  I think the good news on that front is the practices have hired their baby some yeah, some additional charts that they're working through, but they're investing heavily and in technology, we see that with the use of our lab equipment, both in-clinic, as well as reference labs. And obviously, the appetite for software and applications that help them with optimized workflow have continued to grow.  And then overall, our competitive position is very strong and we think as a result of our innovation pipeline, we will continue to be strong enough for some differentiated advantages. So, I think from an industry standpoint, it's a very positive story. I think we're well positioned to capitalize on those trends and the practices just continued to work through some of the constraints we cited. We're not going to be guiding obviously today, but I think we've got a number of positive factors that we see heading into next year in terms of our execution. The competitive position that I noted the innovation pipeline that we're looking forward to sharing more on as we move forward. And I think those are all things that we will be leaning on to continue to delivering solid growth and continue delivering strong financial performance, which I think we're demonstrating our ability to do this year. So we'll share more in that front as we get into next year.  We're focusing on the drivers that we have direct impact on and we feel very good about our execution on that front. Yeah. Good morning, Nate. Yeah, couple additional about comments for - to cover. We always start with PIM customer demand and for what we've seen in the talking with our customers that this good end-market demand certainly pet owners continue to prioritize and against the whole other spending categories, they're bringing their bring their pets to the veterinarian and making sure that they get the care that they need.  The other piece that we've been spending time, looking at is just overall employment levels within the practice and we think that that has increased and that's in a good position. We don't necessarily have insights in terms of how many hours they may be working to put in terms of just availability of staff within practices we think that's been reasonably good shape.  We have done some qualitative surveying. There is some additional churn within practices if that goes from practice to practice, that is obviously something that will work its way through the system. Just picking up what Brian mentioned against not to not wellness or sick patient visits versus the wellness visits, if the diagnostics usage on the non-wellness side is higher, it's much higher at 70% or so I think we map that out as part of the Investor Day.  And so, that's, I think an important tailwind for the business. The other thing that I would point out is the, relative frequency and utilization of diagnostics continues to grow within the practice we've seen that in the US, we think that's a very positive trend. Obviously, veterinarians see the importance of core medical services and to be able to treat a patient they very often have done the first test.  So it's great to see that those trends have held up and continue to grow and we think that's a strong positive. I think we've been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform well in that front in despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So I think our updated outlook for margins if you take out the, if you normalize for the customer credit that we've highlighted, as well as the lapping of R&D and foreign exchange, we're most recent guidance is to be 80 to 100 BPS above the prior year.  And that's despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So, we've consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver to business model, which we have a number of favorable dynamics that support that we highlighted the strong growth in the software business as it is a positive driver force as we grow and I think we've got investments that we can leverage. And we've got new innovation coming to market.  So a number of factors that I think will help us and positions well to keep building on that's strong margin delivery trends. Yes. Good morning, Erin. I am not going to talk about the new platform other than just to reiterate we are looking forward is just a couple months away from BMX and we can talk more about that. More generally speaking the way the new product development process works is, you develop prototypes, you put it in hands of customers, they provide feedback and it goes through an additive process, you get ready to go to marketplace.  So we're excited. We think it's a - we think it's a platform that will make will have the right clinical and business contribution, but really I can't go into additional details beyond that. Yeah, so, a couple maybe high level points and I'll get more specific. Our strategic and innovation approach is really to bring an integrated solution set to the marketplace. So that's in clinic, as well as reference lab, and the connectivity and workflow optimization provided by our software suite, we think is highly differentiated.  It supports what the practices are trying to accomplish in terms of improved standards of care, optimizations of staff productivity, client communications, all of those important things and we continue to innovate through menu expansion and then more specifically, new platforms. And new platforms, it's an important component of our business model in terms of really being able to give our customers reference lab quality testing capability within the practice.  We place it, we tend to place these through marketing programs. IDEXX360 being the primary one customers are able to get that get that placement then you use reference labs or rapid assay or our Software-as-a-Service based PIMS systems, as part of our dollar volume commitment. So there's a significant multiplier impact when you come out with new innovations.  And we just continue to build it through what technology for life philosophy. So we have existing platforms on the marketplace. We will continue to innovate with new slides, for example in chemistry or lots and lots of other examples.  We call antigen within the reference labs. So that becomes more valuable clinically over time and customers use more of it as they grow, we grow. Yeah. Good morning, Chris. We think it's primarily capacity, it continues to be capacity. I think practices are definitely working through that. We've seen a number of things that practices have done. And the - it takes time. I mean they're making investments. So I think they're investing in their staff, as well as technology, they've hired.  They're also just trying to balance the work life balance of their teams, so that they don't lose folks and make sure that it could be stabilized. So I think that's important. We do think at the margin there could be some macro impacts than we've seen in wellness. And I would just also point out that the wellness pieces are relatively lower use intensity-wise of diagnostics.  70% of diagnostic, 70 plus percent of diagnostics are consumed through non-wellness or the sick patient visits. And keep in mind, the international sectors just a bit different in terms of its overall characteristics. It tends to be more of a sick patient roll out testing approach from a veterinary practice standpoint. So, obviously, that that's an area of richer diagnostics usage scenario, less sensitive to some of the discretionary spend that you may see in a difficult macro environment. So, as Brian said, we're happy with our progress and continues to improve we think that the team is executing extremely well, and the opportunity over time is very substantial. Yeah, John, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think we shared some data through went up like Ericson presented on the evolution of menu and how that that impacts the overall economic value over time. And our technology for life approach where we come \u2013 we come out to the marketplace. We introduce product obviously. The installed base grows over time. But as we continue to add menu and improve that, more revenue, more economics are generated. And we've been able to demonstrate that through our platforms including the reference labs. Yeah, and keep in mind, the expanded pet population has been very, very substantial. So, we know that the end-customer demand is there. There is a lot of interest I think that to Brian's point as we work through that capacity at the clinic level. There's unmet unserved demand out there. This is something that we've been we've been doing for a long time. I think we have a very successful formula in terms of how we how we expand the overall commercial ecosystem and footprint in North America. It tends to be a relatively short time to ramp. We have I think a - protective training approach and when we bring new folks into the system, they're well trained. And they really come up to speed within quarters.  Now they continue to become more productive over time, but this they get a lot of support through professional service vets and the field service representatives. The entire ecosystem is there to support them.  Okay. Thank you for your questions. We'll not conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. before we end today's call. I'd like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for delivering another quarter of strong execution against our organic growth strategy. Our sector remains very dynamic and your steadfast commitment to providing a better future for animals, people and our planet has helped us maintain momentum and deliver strong results.  Not only have you delivered today in the third quarter, but your efforts position us well to continue to develop our sector and support our customers well into the future. Well, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being, the pets, people and livestock. So now we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures are provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you to our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieves strong growth and financial performance in the second quarter aligned with our full-year performance goals. Overall revenues increased 10% organically supported by 12% organic growth and CAG diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Key execution metrics remain very strong globally, reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains, and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, both benefiting from strong CAG recurring revenue growth. For the first half of 2023, we achieved 10% overall organic revenue growth and nearly 12% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We also achieved better-than-targeted operating margin improvement. We've made positive refinements to our full-year operational outlook incorporating this performance, which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and 9% organic growth in our water business. Overall organic revenue growth was constrained by modest gains in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues reflecting the winddown of our human COVID testing business. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting 12% gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by global net price gains at the higher end of our targeted 8% to 9% improvement range for the first half of 2023. Overall organic revenue growth was supported by 13% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 6% organically reflecting comparisons to high-priority levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a consistent, strong 1,370 basis point growth premium in Q2 compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 1.3% in the quarter. These results reflect benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels, and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth improved organically to 10% in Q2, reflecting positive volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in sustained new business gains and record Q2 premium instrument placements, which supported a double digit expansion of our premium instrument install base. Double digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally, Q2 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 15% organically with double digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology, and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,740 CAG premium instruments in Q2, an increase of 7% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. Catalyst placements increased 15% globally, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 19% placement growth in international regions. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, demonstrated by 9% global growth in new and competitive catalyst placements, and solid gains in EVI metrics. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally, reflected in a global install base of approximately 10,800 instruments. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 12% organically in Q2, driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and mid-single-digit growth in international, with growth in international regions moderated by macroeconomic impacts, which pressure on same-store sales. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenue increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition continues to progress well, expanding our capabilities in water safety testing, and adding approximately 2% to reported water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 1% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. were offset by impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 11% in the quarter, as reported, and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.7% up 160 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity and operational initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins, and business mix, which offset inflationary cost effects. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60 basis point negative impact related to forward exchange changes, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains. While forward exchange trends have improved, we're expecting approximately 70 to 80 basis points of negative impact in year-on-year reported gross margin comparisons in the second half of 2023, as we work through lapping of $18 million of prior year foreign exchange hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses decreased 17% year-on-year, reflecting a 26% favorable growth rate impact from comparisons to prior year levels, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. Adjusting for this effect, operating expense growth was modestly below revenue growth in the quarter, supporting operating margin gains. EPS was $2.67 per share in Q2, an increase of 71% as reported. On a comparable basis, EPS increased 77%, including approximately 54% of growth rate benefit from lapping the 72% per share prior year impact from discrete R&D investments. Forward exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million, and EPS by $0.07 per share in the quarter, including impacts from lapping $6 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges were limited in the quarter. Free cash flow was $173 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 75%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1% reduction diluted shares outstanding. We did allocate capital share repurchases in the second quarter as we managed our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full year outlook to incorporate our solid first half operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,660 million to $3,750 million, reflecting an 8.5% to 10% organic growth range. This outlook includes a $15 million favorable adjustment for foreign exchange changes, which we now estimate will have a relatively flat full year impact on reported revenue growth at the rate shown in our press release. In terms of our operational growth outlook, we're maintaining our performance goals aligned with the high end of our guidance range of 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 11% CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. This reflects expectations for consistent strong levels of IDEXX execution aligned with H1 trends. Our outlook incorporates approximately 1% of expected H2 headwinds for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues from equivalent days effects. Consistent with earlier guidance, our high end outlook for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflects expectations for 6% to 7% net price gains and a relative flattening of U.S. same-store or clinical visit growth trends in H2. We've raised the low end of our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1% to reflect our strong first half performance. We've also made positive adjustments to our outlook for operating margin performance in 2023. Our updated outlook is for reported operating margins in the range of 29.3% to 29.7% for the full year. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 360 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discreet R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our operating margin outlook reflects expectations for moderated year-on-year comparable gross margin gains in the second half compared to strong prior year levels. We continue to project that foreign exchange will reduce operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year, primarily related to impacts and lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.21 per share for the full year with approximately $0.02 per share of negative impact in the second half, including effects from hedge gain lapping. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.64 to $9.90 per share. This is an increase of $0.23 per share at midpoint, reflecting $0.17 in benefit from our raised operational outlook and $0.06 in combined benefit from refined interest expense and foreign exchange estimates. In terms of our operational outlook for Q3, we're planning for organic revenue growth at the lower end of our updated full year growth range, incorporating expected impacts from approximately 1% of equivalent day headwinds. We expect foreign exchange to provide approximately 1.5% in reported growth rate benefit in the quarter. We're planning for operating margins in the 28.5% to 29% range, reflecting expectations for relatively consistent comparable operating margin performance, adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange margin impacts of approximately 50 basis points during the right hedge gain lapping. We've provided details in our updated full year outlook in the press release tables and earning snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX once again delivered strong results supported by outstanding execution in the second quarter. We advanced our strategy by engaging customers with integrated testing solutions that support their mission and address real-world clinical and practice problems. Demand for medical services remains high, and veterinary and [CAG diagnostics] as a core enabler to guide individualized best care. As a result, we saw strong diagnostic sector revenue growth, with continued gains in diagnostics testing frequency and utilization. IDEXX remains well positioned to further benefit from these trends, thanks to our decades-on focus on diagnostics and the software solutions that deliver key differentiated insights into the patient's health. IDEXX's strong results are reflected in double-digit, total company organic revenue growth, supported by expansion of CAG diagnostics-recurring revenues across regions. For the first time ever, U.S. revenues exceeded $1 billion in the first half of 2023. IDEXX execution drivers continue to fire in all cylinders, as reflected in our financial results, including growth in high-quality premium instrument placements, sustained high-customer retention levels, contribution from new business gains, and net price realization that remains aligned with our expectations. IDEXX commercial teams delivered yet another record quarter of global premium instrument placements, building off high prior year levels and supporting solid EVI gains for the quarter. IDEXX diagnostics and software solutions deliver key insights and productivity improvements to workflow transformation. These results demonstrate that greater number of clinicians are partnering with IDEXX, with the aim to deliver higher care standards and crucial efficiency gains. This support continues to be an important given persistent clinic productivity constraints in a dynamic macro backdrop. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX delivered continued strong performance through key strategic initiatives aimed at driving sector development. I'll start by providing an update on our global commercial execution. It's a key component in driving increased testing utilization of both existing customers as well as new to IDEXX accounts. They are [nearing] around the world seek testing solutions that provide them with key diagnostic insights necessary to choosing and delivering the right care path in an efficient and intuitive way. IDEXX commercial teams, as trusted advisors, seek to provide the most appropriate solution given a practice's objectives. It's a deep appetite for point-of-care solutions that deliver the right performance, ease of use, workflow integration, and economics. Therefore, it was gratifying to see a record second quarter of global premium instrument placements with record placements in both the U.S. and internationally. Second quarter premium placements reflected growth across regions and platforms, highlighting the values that clinicians across different geographies at various stages of practice maturity see in our highly innovative platforms and integrated ecosystem. An important dimension of this success is our menu of customer-friendly marketing programs to adopt IDEXX innovations. The result was continued solid gains in EVI and excellent contribution from new business gains, including a new key U.S. corporate account, very strong ongoing placement performance, and our solid relationships with accounts of all types reinforces our confidence in future flow-through of recurring revenues, and our ability to address the estimated 220,000 global instrument placement opportunities. Our commercial performance this year demonstrates that we have developed the right suite of innovative products to address this significant opportunity. ProCyte One is a great example of this. It's our newest, easy-to-use premium hematology platform. ProCyte One boosts efficiency gains, including load and go reagents in paper-run models while still delivering uncompromised accuracy. It has been a key driver of strong premium hematology placements since its launch in early 2021 and supported record second quarter premium hematology placements. Not only does the growing hematology-installed base support flow-through of recurring revenues, but also drives our broader and clinic business. Sustained mid-90% attach rates with catalysts provide a multiplier benefit that drives growth in our customer base and helps customers realize the benefits of an integrated IDEXX diagnostic suite within their clinics. These multiplied effects supported the strong 15% global growth achieved in catalyst placements in Q2. Strong gains globally and new and competitive accounts. ProCyte One also helps to advance our long-term growth strategy in international regions where most veterinarians are trained to do hematology testing when assessing a patient's baseline health. Strong second quarter performance included double-digit CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth also benefited from the country-level commercial expansions we began in mid-2020. By increasing the density of our commercial reach, IDEXX sales professionals are better able to build relationships with veterinarians and communicate the benefits of diagnostics and software solution utilization and how IDEXX can support them on that journey. The global opportunity we've identified is significant and these expanded commercial teams are the tip of the spear in our multi-modality strategy to drive continued sector development. Benefits from these investments are highly encouraged as evidenced by strong installed based growth supported by excellent placements and new and competitive accounts, revenue gains from new business, and improving customer engagement levels in key international regions. Of additional note, we have also executed a modest expansion of U.S. territories and customer-facing professionals based on highly attractive opportunities still before us in our largest geography. We anticipate all hiring to be completed and in place by the end of this year. In addition to high quality and quantity of instrument placements across regions in Q2, commercial execution helped drive continued adoption of IDEXX innovations, including within our rapid vector board disease screening franchise. Our VDC teams have done a great job communicating the health benefits of a full vector board disease screen versus Heartworm-Only testing. We see consequently 40x plus making up a greater share of in-clinic vector board disease revenue. This adoption is supported by our growing installed base of SNAP Pros, which provides an integrated solution while managing workflow and ensuring charge capture. These focused commercial efforts, combined with relevant and easy to use products, highlights how we continue to build our customer base, which positions IDEXX well for long-term growth. Building on these commercial efforts, IDEXX's growth will continue to benefit from advancement of our innovation strategy, a core component of which is expanding our highly accurate and relevant test menu. We made a significant step forward in this area during the second quarter when we announced the launch of the IDEXX [statinb]test in our North American reference lab network. This novel marker leverages IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury, a hard to diagnose condition that comprises approximately one-third of all kidney cases seen by veterinarians. Cell care is a critical area for diagnostics insights, since the kidneys regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production, while also removing toxins. By adding the staff and B to our Reno portfolio and by pairing it with IDEXX SDMA, our customers will have access to the most comprehensive view of kidney health, helping them uncover structural injury and impaired kidney function. What's even more exciting is we will leverage our SDMA playbook to support adoption by including [statinb] test panels for approximately 2 million patients annually at no additional cost, helping clinicians realize the benefits of IDEXX's world-class diagnostics and deliver a higher standard of care to their patients. IDEXX diagnostic solutions, like the innovative staff and B test, when used in an integrated way with our software portfolio, can contextualize an individual patient's health status and support the veterinarian with interpretation and drawing out the appropriate clinical insights. Our software portfolio, which includes a full stack of solutions, many of which leverage cloud technology, touches all areas of the veterinary clinic. From enabling patient check-ins in the full diagnostics workflow, depending on their communication and charge capture, IDEXX software solutions create a connected ecosystem that supports greater diagnostics utilization, while also helping our busy customers be more efficient. A key driver of customer interest we see in our software solutions is driven by the high demand customers are seeing for medical services. These solutions appeal to both independent and especially corporate customers who are increasingly focused on using software to standardize their workflow at scale. Given this backdrop of high demand for pet healthcare services, busy clinics continue to appreciate the value of cloud-based products, as these intuitive and easy-to-administer products allow them to spend more time focusing on the patients that walk in the door, rather than on time-consuming back-office tasks. In IDEXX cloud-based products, including our ezyVet and NEO PIMS and Web PACS's imaging software, continue to be in high demand as a response to this trend. For example, second quarter cloud-based PIMS once again comprised over 90% of total PIMS placements, and as a result make up nearly 50% of our PIMS installed base. This is a trend we expect to continue and are well positioned to address. In our digital imaging business, record first-half instrument placements supported double-digit organic growth and demonstrate that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX to partner on this piece of their business. It helps grow our base for future high-margin recurring revenues. One driver of this interest is continued innovation of our Web PAC software, which makes it even easier for clinicians to interpret and identify hard-to-detect internal abnormalities. The result of these efforts is an excellent customer experience, which helped earn a world-class NPS rating for our diagnostic imaging business, one proof point of the solid overall experience that customers of all types have with IDEXX. This concludes our review of our second quarter results. I would like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX employees who helped deliver continued strong performance, aligned with our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. We look forward to building on this progress. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to remind you that we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day in August, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 9, followed by presentations at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 10th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live-streamed and recorded via IDEXX.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for the IDEXX's leadership team to provide updates on our strategy, execution drivers, innovation cycle, and long-term growth potential. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations, Dr. Mike Erickson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Point of Care Diagnostics, Mike Lane Executive Vice President and General Manager for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Shrek, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services and Corporate Accounts, and Brian McKean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're also excited to host the live customer conversation led by Jim Pala\u0142acic, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer to provide a firsthand view of the role of diagnostics within the clinic and how IDEXX is supporting our customers in adapting to the dynamic sector backdrop. The event will last approximately four hours and will conclude with a Q&A session. And with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nNathan Rich: Great, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two questions on volumes. I guess first in the U.S. Could you maybe talk, Brian about how clinical visits trended over the course of the quarter? I know you kind of said they had softened earlier in the quarter. Just curious how the quarter played out relative to your expectations and kind of what you're looking for to see that flattening over the balance of the year. And then on international, what drove the improvement in the international CAG growth this quarter? And I think kind of despite the improvement, reference lab kind of remains soft. Why do you think you maybe haven't seen more improvement in reference lab volumes? And can you maybe talk about expectations there for the back half of the year? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your questions, Nate. On the first question, we saw a post-January relatively similar clinical visit trends in the data, I think with hindsight, January benefited from the year on year COVID lapping. And overall for the first quarter it was flat, but the benefit of from that dynamic and I think the clinical visit trends through Q2 were largely consistent. This was consistent with our expectation. We thought we'd see reduction in the headwinds from the clinical visit capacity pullback that happened last year. And we were still working through some compares on that front in the first half. And so that informed how we were thinking about the second half that we would see that normalize and hopefully over time improve given the strong underlying demand that we believe is out there. So that's sort of the U.S. story. Let me give some context on international. I'm sure Jay can add to this that the strength in international came from our in-clinic business, just the very strong growth in our instrument placements, customer engagement, support of strong consumable gains. And so I think that's directly related to our executional focus. And as you pointed out, labs were relatively consistent. We're still seeing the, have seen the macro headwinds relatively more in international markets. That's been a consistent story. And so that moderated what were double digit growth rate benefits from the executional drivers that enabled us to get to double digit overall growth in international markets.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, and just to add to that Nate, from a higher level standpoint, the clinic economics and overall health of the clinics really is healthy. I think revenue, we showed that revenue is growing nicely. So it's certainly not a demand dynamic. And as Brian said, internationally, we've been benefiting really over a number of quarters of record placements. ProCyte One obviously fits well and leverages and multiplies the impact that we've been able to have on total in clinic placement. So I think very strong execution. We're announcing the benefits of the consumables growth. And that has a small ramp to it, but I think the business is healthy. And we saw positive volume growth in Q2 internationally. So I think the clinics are working through the type of capacity constraints and labor challenges that they've had earlier. And we expect that to continue over time.\nNathan Rich: Great, thanks for the details.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Katarina from J.P. Morgan on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So first, just on pricing, I know you probably can't give too much specifics, but directionally, any initial thoughts on how you're going to approach price increases in 2024? On one hand, obviously inflation is slow, but then you also probably could see some upward pressure on cost. So does that warrant larger prices? Just how are you thinking about 2024 price increases? And then the second question is, so if you think about both clinical visit growth and then utilization, any major differences between what you're seeing for your corporate clinic accounts versus your non-profit but owned privately owned accounts? Thank you so much.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, so good morning. Thanks for your question. On the pricing front, first, I just want to reinforce we have a consistent outlook for the second half of 2023 for 6% to 7% overall net price improvement related to CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We're not prepared to share our plans for 2024. What I would note is that we'll have, as we've had in the past, a very thoughtful approach that's aligned with long-term sector development in the value that we deliver through our solutions and our innovations, and we'll evaluate and incorporate inflationary dynamics as part of that approach as we get closer to next year.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, just a couple of words about pricing. To Brian's point, from a philosophical standpoint, we want to make sure we continue to deliver really strong value. And we think that our pricing reflects the fact that we continue to do that. We see really very high retention levels in our business. We see an increase in adoption and utilization. So from the standpoint of, I think, customer receptivity, we think our pricing is appropriate given the circumstances. If you think about our latest baby release and reference labs, it's a great example of how we add value that we're increasing the menu. 2 million patients on a global basis, annual global basis are going to benefit from this. We're not increasing the price of those panels. I think it's just a great example of how we try to keep that value equation appropriately aligned to what our customers need. In terms of corporate versus independent practices, a couple of dynamics to keep in mind. Largely, we don't see big differences, obviously there's differences in things like the size of the practice, corporate practices tend to be a bit larger. There are more specialty practices owned by corporates. They're focused, I think, increasingly on growth. We've seen nice interest, not just in our solutions, like in-clinic premium analyzers, but also software solutions, as they really try to operate the businesses in a more standardized way. They're interested in the same type of diagnostic solutions that independent practices are. We see a lot of interest in things like preventive care, for example, because it's a great way of, I think, continuing to engage pet owners and clients, really uncover, I think, a disease that may be otherwise subclinical or hidden that drives the medical services' envelopes. Very similar profiles between the two with some small differences that I just mentioned.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. The floor is yours.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones for me. First, could you expand a little bit on what you saw in a quarter between wellness and clinical and especially as it touches on preventive care in the United States? Just wondering if you're starting to see, or if you are seeing any separation there, just given the price increases between last year and this year, and just thinking about wellness to spend, consumer sensitivity, if you're seeing any impact on demand from that side of things. And then have a follow up.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, good morning, Mike. It's not unusual to see some variability in a given quarter between wellness and let's say non-wellness or sick patient visits. When you take a look at Q2, on a two-year basis, they were very similar growth profiles between the two. So it's small things that can account for some variability, whether more people are traveling, whether, what have you. What we tend to look at is we tend to look at those diagnostic parameters or menu that are used in wellness areas like 40x plus, for example. And that was very strong growth. So we really haven't seen any drop-off.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, all right, thanks, that's helpful. And then this is a little bit of looking ahead to 3Q, but just focusing specifically on international and Europe in particular. I know in prior years, you guys have seen occasionally a little bit of a headwind from weather, from extreme weather events, whether it's heat waves or hurricanes, et cetera, just because it would impact pet owner behavior or ability or willingness to visit the clinics, things like that. Just thinking about the heat wave in Europe that's been going on for the last month or so. Is that factoring to your guidance at all? Are you anticipating a little bit of an impact on revenues? I know you called out a day's impact on mothering. If there's any other wiggle room built in there for just the extreme weather, thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, Mike, I think weather at times can have impact in the business. Our outlook that I mentioned was that for Q3 was organic revenue growth at the lower end of our full year outlook range. And that basically aligns with consistent, strong execution trends and adjustments for the day's effects and just obviously our pricing's evolving a bit here as well. So just compared to H1, so it's a targeting, consistent, strong execution and we'll address those types of impacts if they occur in the businesses and report on that if that turns out to be a factor.\nMichael Ryskin: All right, thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Daniels: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to dive into the expansion of the U.S. customer facing organization a little bit more. I know it's been a while and you've been more focused on OUS expansion. So can you talk a little bit about, strategically what drove that? Is it just new clinic openings? Are you seeing more opportunities to visit vets? Is it kind of a competitive opening? Just any color there would be helpful.\nJay Mazelsky: Sure. So we've grown significantly in the U.S. over the last -- years. I think it's been over three years since we did last expansion. We're very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the U.S. It's our largest market. It's something that we really evaluate on an ongoing basis. We want to make sure that we have the right account coverage and we'll be able to, we're able to support, product and innovation priorities over time. So we felt that it made sense. Really just comes down to that.\nRyan Daniels: Okay, great. And then it's been a while since you've talked about a new big corporate win. And I'm curious if you could talk about maybe the competitive environment more broadly, post some M&A activity in your space. Are you seeing that open up any opportunities or just normal course of business or more innovation? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, I mean, I think the, it's really normal course of business. We do very well with corporates. We occasionally talk about it, but from a corporate account standpoint, I think they see, increasingly see the integrated benefits of multi-modality solution and software. They're focused on workflow and they're focused on productivity, given the capacity constraints and the need to really operate these models. And I think from a solution standpoint, they appreciate what we're able to bring. We have a footprint that's obviously very broad and deep and can work, can partner with them wherever they are. So I think it's a very natural fit from that standpoint.\nRyan Daniels: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from John Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Block: Thanks guys and good morning. I'll break up my questions. Brian, it seems like the visits are expected to get a bit better in the second half of '23. I think if I had it right, you mentioned flattish, give or take year over year, but 2Q, '23 was down from the 1Q, '23 level. So maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on what helps the 2H, '23 visits from those first half levels, we did some work around labor constraints that might be easing a bit, but we love your thoughts on the improvement in 2H, \u201823. And then do we think about that trend line arguably continuing into 2024? And then I'll ask my follow up.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, thanks John for your question. I think the A part of it is working through this effect we saw in 2022 where there was a pullback in capacity. And so I think the pullback was largely happening in the first half of 2022. And so we knew we'd still be working through some of that. And I think that there'll be some relative improvement which I think you were pointing out. And I think overall we anticipate that we continue to look at the growth in demand that we see in terms of the expansion of the pet population and increased interest in pet health care that being affirmed on a lot of the qualitative work that we do believe that there's underserved demand and believe that that will be a positive tailwind over the long-term continue to feel that's very much part of the growth build that we have for the long-term. And we're working through some dynamics here to help clinics adapted to that and improved their productivity. And I think we can be helpful. So I think our long-term optimism is intact. That should be a positive drive over time. And we've made some positive transitions here in their first part of this year. I'd also highlight sometimes we spend a lot of time on the U.S. trends that internationally we've seen relatively more kind of same-store headwind effect that we've been able to offset with our benefits from our business expansion and engagement and invasions that we're bringing. And I think internationally we see the same kind of a story that over time that there's very strong demand for pet healthcare and it's probably relatively greater macro impacts in the near term. But we think that over time that will improve as well.\nJonathan Block: Got it, that was a very helpful thing for that. And maybe just a pivot to innovation. When I look back to set of you I believe there was a staggered launch with the U.S. leading and then international following. Any color on how we think of those pending new systems will we see sort of the same approach play out you know, the staggered call it. And then I don't know if you've talked about this before but will the manufacturing be handled by yourself or your partners on those new systems? And just sorry, a quick clarifying question. Brian, I think price in the quarter if I got you right was closer to 9% for Q2 but is full year 2023 price still expected to be between 7 to 8. Thanks guys.\nBrian McKeon: I'll let Jay dive into the platforms on your latter question. Yes, that's correct. That's what we said.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, so from a platform standpoint I'm obviously not going to talk about it until we talk about it and get closer to the launch. What I will say, John, from a premium instrument placement and how we think about the opportunity. We typically do start with the U.S. market but there's nothing that says we have to do that. The key is really to build an installed base and get that consumable revenue stream moving. That takes time. I think set of U.S. was one example and we launched it seven plus years ago and we built the installed base and we have a nice profile. So we really focus on being able to really drive sector development and adoption and solve those critical problems and everything else takes care of itself from there.\nJonathan Block: Thanks, guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking the questions and congrats on continued strong execution here. So just a quick question again on that theme of pricing. I know that's one a lot of people talk about but maybe more on the clinic level as we see continued constraints in labor and that's really what we're seeing. Are you seeing pressure from your customers to raise prices themselves? And do you think that's going to continue for say maybe the next six months or so? And do you see any kind of potential to maybe ease in volume as their prices go up or is it equilibrium as because maybe labor is used in a more optimal way? And then just a second to really clarifying short questions. Can you say how many territories you actually added? And then just on the gross margin commentary, you said was it 18 million in terms of what the contribution was because of hedge gains? I'm just trying to make a sense of the 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: That's a quite a different question today. Let me just start with the pricing piece. Obviously clinics control that. If you go back the last five or six quarters, a lot of clinics took multiple price increases on an annual basis. They typically, if you go pre-pandemic or pre-inflationary times, they would increase their prices eight, one time per year. I think a number of clinics on average increase at least two, in some cases three. And that was really just to reflect the higher costs of labor and retaining staff. And in some cases, they needed to add to staff. And so from an employment level standpoint, we think clinics are catching up or caught up. They've hired people. That's not to say they're all working 40 hour weeks. And so in terms of pricing going forward, I think that's really just a reflection of what happens in the economy. At this point, it appears that inflation has moderated somewhat, but we'll have to see how that plays out. And I think they'll make decisions based on how their businesses are doing. Right now, I think clinic revenue, practice revenue is pretty healthy for approaching 6% or so. So I think they feel like they're in a pretty good place from an economic standpoint.\nBrian McKeon: And Dave, to your questions on gross margin and hedge gains, what we were trying to highlight is terms of our year-over-year performance on margins that there is an effect from in 2022 as the dollar was strengthening, we hedge out, we tend to hedge in advance of the year to help us with our planning. And we had, in the second half of last year, eight to recognize the benefit from $18 million in hedge gains. So what's happened with the foreign exchange dynamics is they've actually moved into a positive zone. So we have some benefit on revenue, but we're going to have some reported year-on-year foreign exchange headwinds. We estimated 70-80 basis points in H2 that relate to just lapping those hedge gains that are roll off eventually. So just trying to highlight that as a factor. We try to, each quarter, note what those gains or losses are, so you have that, and that's in our disclosures as well. So, but just wanted to highlight that as you're to understand kind of the outlook.\nDavid Westenberg: Thank you for taking my long question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Balaji Prasad, with Barclays, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Micaela on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you talk about anything particular you saw in the quarter that drove the two-year stocked growth deceleration in CAG recurring? Thank you so much. \nBrian McKeon: [So, a] question. \nJay Mazelsky: Anything that drove the, it was a question, anything that drove the two-year stack CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nJay Mazelsky: Okay, yes, I mean, as we had a very strong quarter in terms of CAG diagnostics, recurrent revenue as indicated. Yes, it was really in part driven by pricing as well as volume growth and just really good execution. So, attention of customers was very good. We saw adoption and utilization of diagnostics really across our broad spectrum. Obviously, consumables in our in-clinic business was very, very strong, and we saw nice performance in international, but that's really more of a cumulative impact of placements that we've, I think achieved over the last, [4-6] quarters.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, I'd highlight the two-year, I'm just looking at the numbers on a two-year basis. We were relatively consistent performance. He won in Q2, so I think we had similar trends, similar benefits, and as Jay highlighted, I think we've had very good execution, including some benefits from the higher pricing this year.\nJay Mazelsky: Okay, so with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call this morning. Thanks for everyone on the phone for your participation. This morning, it's an honor to share another quarter of solid financial and strategic results as we continue to address this significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animals who are on wavering focus on diagnostic insights. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Hope to see you all at investor day, and thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you to our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieves strong growth and financial performance in the second quarter aligned with our full-year performance goals. Overall revenues increased 10% organically supported by 12% organic growth and CAG diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Key execution metrics remain very strong globally, reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains, and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, both benefiting from strong CAG recurring revenue growth. For the first half of 2023, we achieved 10% overall organic revenue growth and nearly 12% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We also achieved better-than-targeted operating margin improvement. We've made positive refinements to our full-year operational outlook incorporating this performance, which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and 9% organic growth in our water business. Overall organic revenue growth was constrained by modest gains in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues reflecting the winddown of our human COVID testing business. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting 12% gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by global net price gains at the higher end of our targeted 8% to 9% improvement range for the first half of 2023. Overall organic revenue growth was supported by 13% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 6% organically reflecting comparisons to high-priority levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a consistent, strong 1,370 basis point growth premium in Q2 compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 1.3% in the quarter. These results reflect benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels, and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth improved organically to 10% in Q2, reflecting positive volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in sustained new business gains and record Q2 premium instrument placements, which supported a double digit expansion of our premium instrument install base. Double digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally, Q2 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 15% organically with double digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology, and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,740 CAG premium instruments in Q2, an increase of 7% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. Catalyst placements increased 15% globally, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 19% placement growth in international regions. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, demonstrated by 9% global growth in new and competitive catalyst placements, and solid gains in EVI metrics. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally, reflected in a global install base of approximately 10,800 instruments. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 12% organically in Q2, driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and mid-single-digit growth in international, with growth in international regions moderated by macroeconomic impacts, which pressure on same-store sales. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenue increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition continues to progress well, expanding our capabilities in water safety testing, and adding approximately 2% to reported water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 1% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. were offset by impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 11% in the quarter, as reported, and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.7% up 160 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity and operational initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins, and business mix, which offset inflationary cost effects. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60 basis point negative impact related to forward exchange changes, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains. While forward exchange trends have improved, we're expecting approximately 70 to 80 basis points of negative impact in year-on-year reported gross margin comparisons in the second half of 2023, as we work through lapping of $18 million of prior year foreign exchange hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses decreased 17% year-on-year, reflecting a 26% favorable growth rate impact from comparisons to prior year levels, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. Adjusting for this effect, operating expense growth was modestly below revenue growth in the quarter, supporting operating margin gains. EPS was $2.67 per share in Q2, an increase of 71% as reported. On a comparable basis, EPS increased 77%, including approximately 54% of growth rate benefit from lapping the 72% per share prior year impact from discrete R&D investments. Forward exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million, and EPS by $0.07 per share in the quarter, including impacts from lapping $6 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges were limited in the quarter. Free cash flow was $173 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 75%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1% reduction diluted shares outstanding. We did allocate capital share repurchases in the second quarter as we managed our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full year outlook to incorporate our solid first half operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,660 million to $3,750 million, reflecting an 8.5% to 10% organic growth range. This outlook includes a $15 million favorable adjustment for foreign exchange changes, which we now estimate will have a relatively flat full year impact on reported revenue growth at the rate shown in our press release. In terms of our operational growth outlook, we're maintaining our performance goals aligned with the high end of our guidance range of 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 11% CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. This reflects expectations for consistent strong levels of IDEXX execution aligned with H1 trends. Our outlook incorporates approximately 1% of expected H2 headwinds for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues from equivalent days effects. Consistent with earlier guidance, our high end outlook for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflects expectations for 6% to 7% net price gains and a relative flattening of U.S. same-store or clinical visit growth trends in H2. We've raised the low end of our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1% to reflect our strong first half performance. We've also made positive adjustments to our outlook for operating margin performance in 2023. Our updated outlook is for reported operating margins in the range of 29.3% to 29.7% for the full year. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 360 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discreet R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our operating margin outlook reflects expectations for moderated year-on-year comparable gross margin gains in the second half compared to strong prior year levels. We continue to project that foreign exchange will reduce operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year, primarily related to impacts and lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.21 per share for the full year with approximately $0.02 per share of negative impact in the second half, including effects from hedge gain lapping. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.64 to $9.90 per share. This is an increase of $0.23 per share at midpoint, reflecting $0.17 in benefit from our raised operational outlook and $0.06 in combined benefit from refined interest expense and foreign exchange estimates. In terms of our operational outlook for Q3, we're planning for organic revenue growth at the lower end of our updated full year growth range, incorporating expected impacts from approximately 1% of equivalent day headwinds. We expect foreign exchange to provide approximately 1.5% in reported growth rate benefit in the quarter. We're planning for operating margins in the 28.5% to 29% range, reflecting expectations for relatively consistent comparable operating margin performance, adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange margin impacts of approximately 50 basis points during the right hedge gain lapping. We've provided details in our updated full year outlook in the press release tables and earning snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your questions, Nate. On the first question, we saw a post-January relatively similar clinical visit trends in the data, I think with hindsight, January benefited from the year on year COVID lapping. And overall for the first quarter it was flat, but the benefit of from that dynamic and I think the clinical visit trends through Q2 were largely consistent. This was consistent with our expectation. We thought we'd see reduction in the headwinds from the clinical visit capacity pullback that happened last year. And we were still working through some compares on that front in the first half. And so that informed how we were thinking about the second half that we would see that normalize and hopefully over time improve given the strong underlying demand that we believe is out there. So that's sort of the U.S. story. Let me give some context on international. I'm sure Jay can add to this that the strength in international came from our in-clinic business, just the very strong growth in our instrument placements, customer engagement, support of strong consumable gains. And so I think that's directly related to our executional focus. And as you pointed out, labs were relatively consistent. We're still seeing the, have seen the macro headwinds relatively more in international markets. That's been a consistent story. And so that moderated what were double digit growth rate benefits from the executional drivers that enabled us to get to double digit overall growth in international markets. Yes, so good morning. Thanks for your question. On the pricing front, first, I just want to reinforce we have a consistent outlook for the second half of 2023 for 6% to 7% overall net price improvement related to CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We're not prepared to share our plans for 2024. What I would note is that we'll have, as we've had in the past, a very thoughtful approach that's aligned with long-term sector development in the value that we deliver through our solutions and our innovations, and we'll evaluate and incorporate inflationary dynamics as part of that approach as we get closer to next year. Yes, Mike, I think weather at times can have impact in the business. Our outlook that I mentioned was that for Q3 was organic revenue growth at the lower end of our full year outlook range. And that basically aligns with consistent, strong execution trends and adjustments for the day's effects and just obviously our pricing's evolving a bit here as well. So just compared to H1, so it's a targeting, consistent, strong execution and we'll address those types of impacts if they occur in the businesses and report on that if that turns out to be a factor. Yes, thanks John for your question. I think the A part of it is working through this effect we saw in 2022 where there was a pullback in capacity. And so I think the pullback was largely happening in the first half of 2022. And so we knew we'd still be working through some of that. And I think that there'll be some relative improvement which I think you were pointing out. And I think overall we anticipate that we continue to look at the growth in demand that we see in terms of the expansion of the pet population and increased interest in pet health care that being affirmed on a lot of the qualitative work that we do believe that there's underserved demand and believe that that will be a positive tailwind over the long-term continue to feel that's very much part of the growth build that we have for the long-term. And we're working through some dynamics here to help clinics adapted to that and improved their productivity. And I think we can be helpful. So I think our long-term optimism is intact. That should be a positive drive over time. And we've made some positive transitions here in their first part of this year. I'd also highlight sometimes we spend a lot of time on the U.S. trends that internationally we've seen relatively more kind of same-store headwind effect that we've been able to offset with our benefits from our business expansion and engagement and invasions that we're bringing. And I think internationally we see the same kind of a story that over time that there's very strong demand for pet healthcare and it's probably relatively greater macro impacts in the near term. But we think that over time that will improve as well. I'll let Jay dive into the platforms on your latter question. Yes, that's correct. That's what we said. And Dave, to your questions on gross margin and hedge gains, what we were trying to highlight is terms of our year-over-year performance on margins that there is an effect from in 2022 as the dollar was strengthening, we hedge out, we tend to hedge in advance of the year to help us with our planning. And we had, in the second half of last year, eight to recognize the benefit from $18 million in hedge gains. So what's happened with the foreign exchange dynamics is they've actually moved into a positive zone. So we have some benefit on revenue, but we're going to have some reported year-on-year foreign exchange headwinds. We estimated 70-80 basis points in H2 that relate to just lapping those hedge gains that are roll off eventually. So just trying to highlight that as a factor. We try to, each quarter, note what those gains or losses are, so you have that, and that's in our disclosures as well. So, but just wanted to highlight that as you're to understand kind of the outlook. [So, a] question. Yes, I'd highlight the two-year, I'm just looking at the numbers on a two-year basis. We were relatively consistent performance. He won in Q2, so I think we had similar trends, similar benefits, and as Jay highlighted, I think we've had very good execution, including some benefits from the higher pricing this year."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX once again delivered strong results supported by outstanding execution in the second quarter. We advanced our strategy by engaging customers with integrated testing solutions that support their mission and address real-world clinical and practice problems. Demand for medical services remains high, and veterinary and [CAG diagnostics] as a core enabler to guide individualized best care. As a result, we saw strong diagnostic sector revenue growth, with continued gains in diagnostics testing frequency and utilization. IDEXX remains well positioned to further benefit from these trends, thanks to our decades-on focus on diagnostics and the software solutions that deliver key differentiated insights into the patient's health. IDEXX's strong results are reflected in double-digit, total company organic revenue growth, supported by expansion of CAG diagnostics-recurring revenues across regions. For the first time ever, U.S. revenues exceeded $1 billion in the first half of 2023. IDEXX execution drivers continue to fire in all cylinders, as reflected in our financial results, including growth in high-quality premium instrument placements, sustained high-customer retention levels, contribution from new business gains, and net price realization that remains aligned with our expectations. IDEXX commercial teams delivered yet another record quarter of global premium instrument placements, building off high prior year levels and supporting solid EVI gains for the quarter. IDEXX diagnostics and software solutions deliver key insights and productivity improvements to workflow transformation. These results demonstrate that greater number of clinicians are partnering with IDEXX, with the aim to deliver higher care standards and crucial efficiency gains. This support continues to be an important given persistent clinic productivity constraints in a dynamic macro backdrop. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX delivered continued strong performance through key strategic initiatives aimed at driving sector development. I'll start by providing an update on our global commercial execution. It's a key component in driving increased testing utilization of both existing customers as well as new to IDEXX accounts. They are [nearing] around the world seek testing solutions that provide them with key diagnostic insights necessary to choosing and delivering the right care path in an efficient and intuitive way. IDEXX commercial teams, as trusted advisors, seek to provide the most appropriate solution given a practice's objectives. It's a deep appetite for point-of-care solutions that deliver the right performance, ease of use, workflow integration, and economics. Therefore, it was gratifying to see a record second quarter of global premium instrument placements with record placements in both the U.S. and internationally. Second quarter premium placements reflected growth across regions and platforms, highlighting the values that clinicians across different geographies at various stages of practice maturity see in our highly innovative platforms and integrated ecosystem. An important dimension of this success is our menu of customer-friendly marketing programs to adopt IDEXX innovations. The result was continued solid gains in EVI and excellent contribution from new business gains, including a new key U.S. corporate account, very strong ongoing placement performance, and our solid relationships with accounts of all types reinforces our confidence in future flow-through of recurring revenues, and our ability to address the estimated 220,000 global instrument placement opportunities. Our commercial performance this year demonstrates that we have developed the right suite of innovative products to address this significant opportunity. ProCyte One is a great example of this. It's our newest, easy-to-use premium hematology platform. ProCyte One boosts efficiency gains, including load and go reagents in paper-run models while still delivering uncompromised accuracy. It has been a key driver of strong premium hematology placements since its launch in early 2021 and supported record second quarter premium hematology placements. Not only does the growing hematology-installed base support flow-through of recurring revenues, but also drives our broader and clinic business. Sustained mid-90% attach rates with catalysts provide a multiplier benefit that drives growth in our customer base and helps customers realize the benefits of an integrated IDEXX diagnostic suite within their clinics. These multiplied effects supported the strong 15% global growth achieved in catalyst placements in Q2. Strong gains globally and new and competitive accounts. ProCyte One also helps to advance our long-term growth strategy in international regions where most veterinarians are trained to do hematology testing when assessing a patient's baseline health. Strong second quarter performance included double-digit CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth also benefited from the country-level commercial expansions we began in mid-2020. By increasing the density of our commercial reach, IDEXX sales professionals are better able to build relationships with veterinarians and communicate the benefits of diagnostics and software solution utilization and how IDEXX can support them on that journey. The global opportunity we've identified is significant and these expanded commercial teams are the tip of the spear in our multi-modality strategy to drive continued sector development. Benefits from these investments are highly encouraged as evidenced by strong installed based growth supported by excellent placements and new and competitive accounts, revenue gains from new business, and improving customer engagement levels in key international regions. Of additional note, we have also executed a modest expansion of U.S. territories and customer-facing professionals based on highly attractive opportunities still before us in our largest geography. We anticipate all hiring to be completed and in place by the end of this year. In addition to high quality and quantity of instrument placements across regions in Q2, commercial execution helped drive continued adoption of IDEXX innovations, including within our rapid vector board disease screening franchise. Our VDC teams have done a great job communicating the health benefits of a full vector board disease screen versus Heartworm-Only testing. We see consequently 40x plus making up a greater share of in-clinic vector board disease revenue. This adoption is supported by our growing installed base of SNAP Pros, which provides an integrated solution while managing workflow and ensuring charge capture. These focused commercial efforts, combined with relevant and easy to use products, highlights how we continue to build our customer base, which positions IDEXX well for long-term growth. Building on these commercial efforts, IDEXX's growth will continue to benefit from advancement of our innovation strategy, a core component of which is expanding our highly accurate and relevant test menu. We made a significant step forward in this area during the second quarter when we announced the launch of the IDEXX [statinb]test in our North American reference lab network. This novel marker leverages IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury, a hard to diagnose condition that comprises approximately one-third of all kidney cases seen by veterinarians. Cell care is a critical area for diagnostics insights, since the kidneys regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production, while also removing toxins. By adding the staff and B to our Reno portfolio and by pairing it with IDEXX SDMA, our customers will have access to the most comprehensive view of kidney health, helping them uncover structural injury and impaired kidney function. What's even more exciting is we will leverage our SDMA playbook to support adoption by including [statinb] test panels for approximately 2 million patients annually at no additional cost, helping clinicians realize the benefits of IDEXX's world-class diagnostics and deliver a higher standard of care to their patients. IDEXX diagnostic solutions, like the innovative staff and B test, when used in an integrated way with our software portfolio, can contextualize an individual patient's health status and support the veterinarian with interpretation and drawing out the appropriate clinical insights. Our software portfolio, which includes a full stack of solutions, many of which leverage cloud technology, touches all areas of the veterinary clinic. From enabling patient check-ins in the full diagnostics workflow, depending on their communication and charge capture, IDEXX software solutions create a connected ecosystem that supports greater diagnostics utilization, while also helping our busy customers be more efficient. A key driver of customer interest we see in our software solutions is driven by the high demand customers are seeing for medical services. These solutions appeal to both independent and especially corporate customers who are increasingly focused on using software to standardize their workflow at scale. Given this backdrop of high demand for pet healthcare services, busy clinics continue to appreciate the value of cloud-based products, as these intuitive and easy-to-administer products allow them to spend more time focusing on the patients that walk in the door, rather than on time-consuming back-office tasks. In IDEXX cloud-based products, including our ezyVet and NEO PIMS and Web PACS's imaging software, continue to be in high demand as a response to this trend. For example, second quarter cloud-based PIMS once again comprised over 90% of total PIMS placements, and as a result make up nearly 50% of our PIMS installed base. This is a trend we expect to continue and are well positioned to address. In our digital imaging business, record first-half instrument placements supported double-digit organic growth and demonstrate that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX to partner on this piece of their business. It helps grow our base for future high-margin recurring revenues. One driver of this interest is continued innovation of our Web PAC software, which makes it even easier for clinicians to interpret and identify hard-to-detect internal abnormalities. The result of these efforts is an excellent customer experience, which helped earn a world-class NPS rating for our diagnostic imaging business, one proof point of the solid overall experience that customers of all types have with IDEXX. This concludes our review of our second quarter results. I would like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX employees who helped deliver continued strong performance, aligned with our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. We look forward to building on this progress. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to remind you that we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day in August, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 9, followed by presentations at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 10th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live-streamed and recorded via IDEXX.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for the IDEXX's leadership team to provide updates on our strategy, execution drivers, innovation cycle, and long-term growth potential. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations, Dr. Mike Erickson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Point of Care Diagnostics, Mike Lane Executive Vice President and General Manager for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Shrek, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services and Corporate Accounts, and Brian McKean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're also excited to host the live customer conversation led by Jim Pala\u0142acic, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer to provide a firsthand view of the role of diagnostics within the clinic and how IDEXX is supporting our customers in adapting to the dynamic sector backdrop. The event will last approximately four hours and will conclude with a Q&A session. And with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Yes, and just to add to that Nate, from a higher level standpoint, the clinic economics and overall health of the clinics really is healthy. I think revenue, we showed that revenue is growing nicely. So it's certainly not a demand dynamic. And as Brian said, internationally, we've been benefiting really over a number of quarters of record placements. ProCyte One obviously fits well and leverages and multiplies the impact that we've been able to have on total in clinic placement. So I think very strong execution. We're announcing the benefits of the consumables growth. And that has a small ramp to it, but I think the business is healthy. And we saw positive volume growth in Q2 internationally. So I think the clinics are working through the type of capacity constraints and labor challenges that they've had earlier. And we expect that to continue over time. Yes, just a couple of words about pricing. To Brian's point, from a philosophical standpoint, we want to make sure we continue to deliver really strong value. And we think that our pricing reflects the fact that we continue to do that. We see really very high retention levels in our business. We see an increase in adoption and utilization. So from the standpoint of, I think, customer receptivity, we think our pricing is appropriate given the circumstances. If you think about our latest baby release and reference labs, it's a great example of how we add value that we're increasing the menu. 2 million patients on a global basis, annual global basis are going to benefit from this. We're not increasing the price of those panels. I think it's just a great example of how we try to keep that value equation appropriately aligned to what our customers need. In terms of corporate versus independent practices, a couple of dynamics to keep in mind. Largely, we don't see big differences, obviously there's differences in things like the size of the practice, corporate practices tend to be a bit larger. There are more specialty practices owned by corporates. They're focused, I think, increasingly on growth. We've seen nice interest, not just in our solutions, like in-clinic premium analyzers, but also software solutions, as they really try to operate the businesses in a more standardized way. They're interested in the same type of diagnostic solutions that independent practices are. We see a lot of interest in things like preventive care, for example, because it's a great way of, I think, continuing to engage pet owners and clients, really uncover, I think, a disease that may be otherwise subclinical or hidden that drives the medical services' envelopes. Very similar profiles between the two with some small differences that I just mentioned. Yes, good morning, Mike. It's not unusual to see some variability in a given quarter between wellness and let's say non-wellness or sick patient visits. When you take a look at Q2, on a two-year basis, they were very similar growth profiles between the two. So it's small things that can account for some variability, whether more people are traveling, whether, what have you. What we tend to look at is we tend to look at those diagnostic parameters or menu that are used in wellness areas like 40x plus, for example. And that was very strong growth. So we really haven't seen any drop-off. Sure. So we've grown significantly in the U.S. over the last -- years. I think it's been over three years since we did last expansion. We're very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the U.S. It's our largest market. It's something that we really evaluate on an ongoing basis. We want to make sure that we have the right account coverage and we'll be able to, we're able to support, product and innovation priorities over time. So we felt that it made sense. Really just comes down to that. Yes, I mean, I think the, it's really normal course of business. We do very well with corporates. We occasionally talk about it, but from a corporate account standpoint, I think they see, increasingly see the integrated benefits of multi-modality solution and software. They're focused on workflow and they're focused on productivity, given the capacity constraints and the need to really operate these models. And I think from a solution standpoint, they appreciate what we're able to bring. We have a footprint that's obviously very broad and deep and can work, can partner with them wherever they are. So I think it's a very natural fit from that standpoint. Yes, so from a platform standpoint I'm obviously not going to talk about it until we talk about it and get closer to the launch. What I will say, John, from a premium instrument placement and how we think about the opportunity. We typically do start with the U.S. market but there's nothing that says we have to do that. The key is really to build an installed base and get that consumable revenue stream moving. That takes time. I think set of U.S. was one example and we launched it seven plus years ago and we built the installed base and we have a nice profile. So we really focus on being able to really drive sector development and adoption and solve those critical problems and everything else takes care of itself from there. Thank you. That's a quite a different question today. Let me just start with the pricing piece. Obviously clinics control that. If you go back the last five or six quarters, a lot of clinics took multiple price increases on an annual basis. They typically, if you go pre-pandemic or pre-inflationary times, they would increase their prices eight, one time per year. I think a number of clinics on average increase at least two, in some cases three. And that was really just to reflect the higher costs of labor and retaining staff. And in some cases, they needed to add to staff. And so from an employment level standpoint, we think clinics are catching up or caught up. They've hired people. That's not to say they're all working 40 hour weeks. And so in terms of pricing going forward, I think that's really just a reflection of what happens in the economy. At this point, it appears that inflation has moderated somewhat, but we'll have to see how that plays out. And I think they'll make decisions based on how their businesses are doing. Right now, I think clinic revenue, practice revenue is pretty healthy for approaching 6% or so. So I think they feel like they're in a pretty good place from an economic standpoint. Anything that drove the, it was a question, anything that drove the two-year stack CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth? Okay, yes, I mean, as we had a very strong quarter in terms of CAG diagnostics, recurrent revenue as indicated. Yes, it was really in part driven by pricing as well as volume growth and just really good execution. So, attention of customers was very good. We saw adoption and utilization of diagnostics really across our broad spectrum. Obviously, consumables in our in-clinic business was very, very strong, and we saw nice performance in international, but that's really more of a cumulative impact of placements that we've, I think achieved over the last, [4-6] quarters. Okay, so with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call this morning. Thanks for everyone on the phone for your participation. This morning, it's an honor to share another quarter of solid financial and strategic results as we continue to address this significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animals who are on wavering focus on diagnostic insights. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Hope to see you all at investor day, and thank you."

In reviewing our first quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. IDEXX had a solid start to 2023. In terms of highlights for the quarter, overall revenues increased 10% organically, supported by nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were driven by nearly 14% organic growth in the U.S. supported by solid volume gains and benefits from the higher net price realization. Key execution metrics remained strong globally reflected in record first quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 18% on a comparable basis reflecting solid organic revenue growth, better than expected gross margin gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. These strong results reflect the durability and resiliency of the IDEXX business model and benefits from our ongoing focus on execution. We've incorporated our Q1 results in positive adjustments to our full-year financial outlook which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and solid 8% growth in Water. Overall organic revenue gains were moderated by 2% declines in our LPD business and approximately $4 million of revenue headwind related to lower human COVID testing revenues, a business area that we winded down completely in Q1. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 12% organically reflecting 14% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8% to 9% range, consistent with our expectations. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 7% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a 1,350 basis point growth premium compared to relatively flat same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels in Q1. These results reflected benefits from execution drivers including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from these drivers were moderated by impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 12% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth on our global premium instrument installed base reflecting double-digit increases across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,425 CAG premium instruments in Q1, an increase of 3% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels building on the record placement levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflected 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally reflecting in a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 12% organically driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 11% organically reflecting strong gains in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in international, with growth in key international regions moderated by macro-economic impacts, which have pressured same-store sales. In terms of other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition has progressed well expanding our capabilities in Water safety testing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 2% organically as solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were offset by comparisons to high prior year sales levels in herd health screening and reduced revenues from non-core food and safety products in certain regions. Turning to the P&L, Q1 profit results were supported by a 150 basis point improvement in reported operating margins reflecting 10% organic revenue growth, solid gross profit gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.3% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Later timing of lab staffing increases and select operational upsides also supported Q1 gross profit results. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 50 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, including lapping of prior year hedge gains. Operating expenses increased 5% year-on-year as reported in the quarter and 7% on a comparable basis. This was net of a $16 million or 6% operating expense growth offset related to the customer contract resolution payment. As planned, we saw higher growth in sales & marketing and R&D expense in the quarter related to specific factors including the return of in-person sales meetings this year and advancement of key innovation initiatives. EPS was $2.55 per share in Q1, an increase of 12% as reported and 18% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $12 million and EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Free cash flow was $144 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 65%. For the full-year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 1x net of cash down modestly from Q4 levels. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1.9% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the first quarter, as we manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full-year outlook to incorporate our solid Q1 operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We're updating our full-year guidance for reported revenues to $3,615 million to $3,700 million, this includes a $10 million positive adjustment for foreign exchange impacts, which we now estimate will provide a relatively modest full-year headwind to reported revenue growth. Our updated outlook for overall organic revenue growth is 7.5% to 10%. Our Q1 results tracked towards the high end of this range and we're maintaining consistent high-end targets for our performance this year, reflecting benefits from execution drivers and the potential for reduced clinical visit growth headwinds. As part of our financial management approach, we incorporated risk estimates to our targeted growth performance in the low end of our organic revenue growth range, including potential effects from macro-economic conditions. We raised the low end of our full-year organic revenue growth outlook by 0.5% in our updated guidance, incorporating our solid start to the year. We're maintaining our outlook for solid operating margin performance in 2023 with an expectation for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5% for the full-year. At the high-end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. We now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year slightly higher than earlier projections, which included impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.33 to $9.75 per share, reflecting a $0.06 per share increase in our low-end estimate. We continue to estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.23 for the full-year with the bulk of this impact in the first half. In terms of our operational outlook for Q2, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth consistent with the midpoint to higher end of our full-year growth outlook range with approximately 1% of reported growth headwind from year-on-year FX changes. In terms of Q2 operating margins, we're planning for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margin performance year-on-year adjusting for about 70 basis points in negative foreign exchange impacts and benefits from comparisons to prior year results, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. We've provided details on our updated outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshot. Overall, we're applying a disciplined financial approach that advances our growth strategy and mitigates potential macro risks to ensure delivery of continued strong financial performance. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX had a very strong start to 2023, driven by sustained execution of our growth strategy. Demand for Companion Animal medical services continues to grow, supported by IDEXX innovation and direct customer engagement. Veterinarians continue to focus on meeting these high levels of demand with the best possible medical care, with diagnostics as an essential component of this care equation. IDEXX remains a chosen, trusted partner to veterinarians who appreciate how our world-class products and connected ecosystem enable high standards of care, while resulting in growth of a significant profit center within their clinics. IDEXX's strong execution is reflected in double-digit total company organic revenue growth, supported by strong expansion of global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Growth in this recurring revenue annuity was supported by solid contribution for new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates, and net price realization aligned with our expectations. Our commercial teams drove another record quarter for global premium instrument placements and excellent levels of cloud-based software placements. IDEXX products and services offer solutions to improve clinic productivity and support the significantly expanded and underserved demand we've seen for pet healthcare in recent years including net pet additions in the U.S. of 2% in 2022, twice the pre-pandemic trend line. These efforts supported strong IDEXX growth as we continue to work effectively through the near-term sector headwinds related to clinic, capacity constraints, and global macro conditions. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX's sustained execution against our strategy to drive the adoption and utilization of diagnostics help deliver continued strong financial results. First, I'll provide an update on our commercial execution, which through education and customer engagement drives relevant utilization of IDEXX's innovative solutions. IDEXX commercial teams delivered another record first quarter global premium instrument placements to start 2023, building on very strong prior year results. Our commercial teams demonstrated a continued ability to advance placement, quantity and quality. This is reflected in strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally driving solid EVI achievement. These commercial results are highly encouraging as we address the significant opportunity for an estimated 220,000 worldwide premium instrument placements and give us confidence that we have the right strategic playbook in place. IDEXX professionals provide world-class, software-enabled products that are in high demand, and supported by a wide menu of customer-friendly marketing programs that enable adoption of new technology. These results also reflect continued strong clinical interest in using IDEXX's products and services, to not only meet the increased demand for pet healthcare, but to deliver the best possible level of care. Our commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits that flow from IDEXX innovations as evidenced by the success of our newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides customers with an attractive in-clinic hematology solution, its small footprint, easy pay-per-run model, and lower cost come without sacrificing CBC performance. IDEXX premium placements have benefited from strong ProCyte One adoption to date thanks to sustained high attach rates with Catalyst, as defined by ProCyte One placements either with a Catalyst or at an existing Catalyst customer. The result is a multiplier benefit, supported by clinics who choose to outfit their in-clinic suite with IDEXX products. As a result, we are nearly halfway to the incremental 20,000 premium hematology placement objective we shared at Investor Day following ProCyte One's launch, while the strong attach rates should also help IDEXX penetrate the long-term worldwide placement opportunity. Key to developing this long-term opportunity will be increasing customer engagement in international regions. We're leveraging our successful VDC model to build strong relationships with international customers, as evidenced by sustained strong new business gains and a 19% increase in Catalyst placements. This strong performance is allowing us to deliver solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in international regions, despite continued macro headwinds, which are pressured same-store clinical visit levels. Customer engagement remains excellent as evidenced by high reach to revenue levels in the first quarter, including benefits from our expanded commercial sales force in targeted regions. The flywheel is beginning to turn in these countries, where we've seen excellent gains from new business, strong interest in engaging with customer marketing programs, and solid overall volume growth. Commercial expansion is an important early step in our international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize our reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One, and drive further adoption of software tools like VetConnect PLUS, our cloud-based diagnostic portal. Software innovation continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy globally. IDEXX software solutions are a key enabler of diagnostics utilization, creating a connected ecosystem that helps improve diagnostics workflow, while providing deeper clinical insights and supporting pet-owner communication. It's an attractive standalone business as well. Strong PIMS placements in the first quarter were supported by continued preference for cloud-native products, with IDEXX well-positioned to address this trend. Placements of cloud-based products maintained the strong velocity we saw coming out of 2022 and represented greater than 90% of total placements supported by continued high interest in our ezyVet and Neo solutions, which are seamlessly integrated into our product offering. This provides customers with options when it comes to picking the best, most relevant PIMS solution for their clinic size and workflow complexity. Our strong first quarter placement performance supported double-digit recurring revenue growth with an attractive gross margin profile and we're on track to achieve this year a PIMS footprint that is over 50% cloud-based. This milestone is especially important in the current veterinary clinic environment, where productivity is a priority in addressing the sustained high levels of demand seen through the pandemic. By embracing IDEXX's cloud-based ecosystem, customers gain the advantage of an easy-to-use software stack that touches every area of the veterinary clinic. And the benefit of these tools is enduring for our customers, evidenced by strong engagement metrics across applications -- including increasing rates of our Web PACS user base that are power users as well as sustained rates of VetConnect PLUS users who use the software as part of their daily routine. Adoption and continued use of these products allows veterinarians and their staffs to spend more time focusing on the care they deliver to their patients rather than on costly, time-intensive administrative activities. Our software strategy is to increase cloud-adoption and build increased business and clinical functionality into IDEXX software solutions. Another use case of our innovation agenda is our 4Dx Plus Test, the gold standard test for canine vector-borne disease testing. The current 4Dx Plus Test is our fourth version on a multiplexed canine vector-borne disease diagnostics over the past 20 plus years with improved sensitivity of Anaplasma and 2x increase in the ability to store the product at room temperature. This is a true testament to our Technology for Life strategy and supported 12% global organic rapid assay recurring revenue growth and solid customer gains in the first quarter. A full vector-borne screen using 4Dx Plus is recommended over a Heartworm-only test given significant increases in incidence and prevalence of vector-borne diseases over the past 10 plus years. And yet, in 2022 less than one in every five dogs received this comprehensive level of testing. 4Dx Plus enables veterinarians to deliver this higher standard of care, with follow-up testing and care protocol guidance provided through DecisionIQ, which aim to drive better health outcomes, while encouraging increased diagnostic testing. Furthermore, our entire rapid assay franchise is supported by the SNAP Pro analyzer. The analyzer not only simplifies the workflow when running a SNAP test, but also ensures the diagnostic results flow seamlessly to VetConnect PLUS and ultimately result in charge capture and invoicing at the point of sale. This is a clear case of how our products, integral components of our connected software ecosystem, improve in value over time, while delivering a multiplier benefit to our customers and drive IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. The sustained execution against our commercial and innovation agendas is made possible by an unrelenting focus on our customers and ensuring they have world-class experience with IDEXX. This takes multiple forms, all focused to ensure our customers and the resources they need to provide the best possible levels of medical care. Continued 99% plus product availability and reliable, fast reference lab service turnaround times provide them with important business continuity and are the result of our investment in manufacturing and supply chain logistics teams, facilities, and relationships. Additionally, the support of the high-touch, highly knowledgeable sales teams that we have built out over the decades ensures they have the products and services that are right for their busy clinics. Our customers realize the benefits of the IDEXX partnership every day, and in turn reward us with their business and their enduring loyalty, as measured by another quarter of consistent, high customer retention rates. Providing our customers with reliable, consistent support is even more essential right now given the dynamic backdrop of our sector. High demand for animal medical services combined with sustained labor supply constraints continue to create productivity and growth challenges at the clinic level. Taking our customer support efforts a step further, we recently published an empirically based study, which examines the drivers of productivity within a practice and helps customers to understand their productivity strengths and areas for opportunities. Through this rigorous effort we found three key drivers of practice productivity. Number one workflow, which includes staffing models like optimized technician to veterinarian mix, and staff and patient friendly physical layout of the practice. Number two technology or digitizing each step of the patient workflow to remove high effort administrative routines. Number three the role of culture including clarity of roles and responsibilities, investments in training and staff effectiveness, and aligned incentives to drive teamwork and achievement of practice goals. As a result of this initiative, we believe there is still a great opportunity for clinics to improve productivity measures and we look forward to educating and supporting our customers in these efforts. Opportunities to do so could result in 30% or more incremental visit capacity, even for practices that are in the top cohort of productivity. We are integrating elements of these efforts into our strategy and commercial approach this year. With that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for the commitment and passion they bring to our purpose-driven work every day. Your efforts not only help provide a better future for animals, people, and our planet, but you also supported IDEXX in starting 2023 on a strong financial note. We have an attractive sector and a strong track record, and the opportunity ahead of us, which is significant is to work with our customers to elevate companion animal healthcare standards through increased diagnostics utilization. The tireless work of the IDEXX team has positioned us well to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. Now, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. To ask a question, we'll take our first question from Nathan Rich.\nNathan Rich: Thanks for the question.\nJay Mazelsky: Hi, Nate.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had two on the updated guidance. Brian, on top-line, I think you've talked about targeting the high-end of the CAG Dx recurring revenue range at 11%. First quarter came in a bit better than expected. I guess any change in how you're thinking about getting to that for the full-year? And any change in assumptions on either kind of the U.S. or international outlooks based on what you've seen through the first quarter?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question. We have a similar outlook at the high-end. I think we feel very good about the start to the year, particularly in the U.S. And so I think the drivers of that, we highlighted pricing being a positive driver for us this year and the execution is consistent with what we had expected. And I think the executional drivers that help to deliver solid volume growth in the U.S., we're very encouraged by. And looking to build on that. I think internationally, we also saw excellent execution drivers I mentioned, we had double-digit growth benefit from things like new business gains, including benefits from strong instrument placements, higher pricing. We are seeing continued headwinds from macro factors in international markets. So the growth was somewhat below our higher end target so on balance, we feel a good start to the year. I still think that's a good full-year goal for the company and looking forward to continuing to execute well to deliver against it.\nNathan Rich: Okay. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up on the operating margin guidance. I think you mentioned kind of unchanged outside of the FX impact. Gross margin, I think you said came in better than expected, but was offset I guess by higher OpEx. Could you maybe just talk about how that plays out over the balance of the year? Especially sales and marketing, I think was up meaningfully as a percent of revenue in the first quarter. Just what drove that increase? And how should we think about the run rate for the full-year?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, let me try to break that down. We had an expectation for the first quarter for an improvement in reported operating margins of 50 to 100 basis points. We came in at 150. So that was better than expected. That was principally on the gross margin line. We saw some benefit in the quarter from kind of later than time planned staffing in areas like our labs and some specific operational factors more Q1 related. So I think we feel good about the overall performance and do think that the high-end goals that we have are still appropriate. As we highlighted coming into the year, we knew that we had some costs coming back here, just more interface with our customers, more travel I think we're anticipating that to continue. We're trying to support our employees in a higher inflation environment as well. And we do have investments that we're advancing in areas like R&D. I know we've highlighted in the past a couple of new platforms that we're advancing that we're investing behind. So those are all captured in our outlook. I think on balance, our performance is very much in line with what we're targeting again, a good start to the year. And we think the full-year goal is on an -- if we adjust out the R&D lapping and the customer contract resolution payment for a solid 60 basis point comparable improvement and right in line with what we were hoping to achieve this year, and we look forward to working to deliver on that.\nNathan Rich: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Great, thanks very much. Just two questions for me. The first was just any comments on the Mars Heska proposed acquisition and the impact that could have on the competitive landscape. And then my second one was just a question on price. Just trying to get my hands around just feedback you're getting on the moves you've made. And are you seeing any impact at all on demand from these changes? We think about whether it's wellness visits or less acute conditions. I know that's kind of -- seems to be kind of a topic that's top of mind for investors. So I just love to have any just directional comments of what you're hearing on price would be appreciated. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Good morning, Chris. This is Jay. So let me take your second question first, and then I'll address the acquisition. Overall, we think pricing to our customers is appropriate within the current environment. From an overall demand standpoint, we see that holding up well relative to the macro conditions, as we've described it in the different pricing scenarios. From just a pet owner perspective, we think they've demonstrated and willingness. We see this both from experience as well as just the survey work that they continue to prioritize health care for their pets. And keep in mind that diagnostics is a relatively small piece of the overall patient spend on their pets. Specifically to your point around wellness versus non-wellness, we've seen the two pretty much move in lockstep over the last five quarters. Or so of course, if the macro -- when we see sort of the macro deterioration from an environmental standpoint during the pandemic, there was some divergence. But generally, at least over the last year plus, they've moved in lockstep. And just an interesting, I think proof point of that, if you take a look at the 4Dx diagnostics testing, it's been highly durable. That's primarily a wellness test and we think indicative of the good end customer demand and pull-through. From the standpoint of the Mars Heska acquisition, just as a matter of policy, we don't comment on specific customer relationships, except to say that no single customer comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Our customer base is very large and diversified. I think as you know and we maintain and have excellent relationships and a great long-term track record with our corporate customers. They, I think very much appreciate the broad solution portfolio both on the diagnostics as well as software side where we can support their objectives to grow and deliver great care. And it probably just as importantly, footprint-wise to be where there. I think the acquisition itself reflects what we've said all along the attractiveness of the animal health sector and more specifically, diagnostics that we think \u2013 long-term, that it can help support the overall market or sector development of diagnostics.\nChristopher Schott: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJonathan Block: Yes, hi. It's Jon from Stifel. Is it -- can you guys hear me okay?\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, we can.\nJonathan Block: Sorry, the operator jumped in, I guess, is the -- sorry about that. First question, Brian, it was a good quarter. The CAG Dx revenue of $11.6 million was above the high end of your prior 8.5% to 11%. And I think you expected on the last call 1Q '23 to be more at the midpoint of the annual guide, and you came in above the high end. So maybe just talk to us on what drove the upside. I believe price was in line with your prior thoughts. So do you chalk it up more to U.S. than international? That would be my knee-jerk reaction. But would love to hear from you. And then if it is in the U.S., is it more specific to call it, IDEXX drivers? Or did you see some upside, call it, industry visits relative to where your head was at three months ago?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, thanks for the question, Jon. We did have a really good start to the year in the U.S. I think our pricing, as you pointed out was globally in line with what we had planned. So we feel good about the execution there. I would say the U.S. clinical visits were overall for the quarter a little better than we anticipated. They were flat, as I mentioned, and we thought we'd still be working through some compares on that front. I think we got some benefit really early in the quarter, I think with some positive growth that helped there. And the -- our own volume execution, the difference between how much growth is coming from our volume relative to clinical visits was a solid 5%, that's kind of pre-pandemic level. So we -- that was in line with kind of where we're hoping to achieve. So on balance, U.S. combined came through quite well. I think international was in line, I would say with what we were guiding towards. We had very good execution as noted and continue to see some macro headwinds that we're working through. So on balance, I think we feel good about the start to the year, as I shared earlier. And we have some goals at the higher end that would help us deliver 10% overall organic growth, which is our goal and we think we're working well towards that. And we're acknowledging that we're in an environment where there is some macro risk, and we think it's proven to have a range of estimates there and continue to monitor those trends as we work through the year. But I think on balance, we feel good about the start.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. And I would just build on that to say that I would build on Brian's comments and just emphasize the excellent commercial drivers that we've talked about certainly pricing, as Brian mentioned, new customer acquisition has been strong, both U.S. and internationally. Customer retention rates continue to remain strong. I think the customer interest and appetite for technology, we see that in premium instrument placements as well as software. And I think that's really reflective of the -- some of the capacity challenges that they see. So overall, I think from an execution standpoint, a very strong quarter.\nJonathan Block: Perfect. That was helpful, guys. Thanks for that. And then I might have a couple of parts to it. But before just below the line for the guide -- is it essentially a wash like there's some less interest expense, but there's less share repo. You had some wording around the hedges and the way that flows through the change. So just broadly speaking below the line, is it a wash when we think about your current '23 EPS versus where it was back in February. And then the second part of that question is, guys even if you keep it at a high level, can you just talk about what needs to be done for the two new point-of-care systems? And are those initiatives running in parallel, just when we think about timing there? Thanks for your help.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, just to clarify on the profit guide, our operating margin outlook is consistent. We have a slightly higher headwind from FX. And so on a comparable basis, the high end is the same and the low end is up, I think slightly. We obviously have some positive flow-through from raising the low end of the revenue. So that's the EPS adjustment. And you're correct. We had lower interest expense projected to offset by relatively lower projected reductions in shares outstanding. So that was a net flat effect.\nJay Mazelsky: And I would just say from a product development standpoint, I'm not going to be specific, obviously, but we are running parallel programs. We continue to invest in software assays, instruments. We spend a lot of money on innovation. We think there's great opportunities across the portfolio and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer.\nJonathan Block: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. Jay, Brian, I want to start on OUS specifically. Could you just clarify -- I think you said 8% OUS. Was that CAG recurring or CAG total? And then just in general, did that come in line with expectations? Anything specific you can call out on OUS results? I think you just commented on the macro environment, but anyone that you can point to either by region or by sort of the factors that are driving that?\nBrian McKeon: Yes, let me clarify the numbers. I'll let Jay talk to the regional dynamics. It was 8% -- 7.6% CAG Dx recurring. And Mike, I would say that's pretty much in line with the outlook that we shared for the quarter. I think the execution drivers were very -- were strong, in line. We had 17% growth in instrument placements, double-digit benefit from things that weren't related to same-store sales dynamics. And we continue to see the kind of pressure that we've seen on macro -- for macro trends on the same-store side. But we've been building that into our outlook, and I think that was in line with what we were anticipating and kind of consistent with our full-year view as well.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I mean just to support that, we've seen relatively speaking, more macro impacts outside the U.S. As I had mentioned previously, our execution drivers internationally have been excellent. We've done seven commercial expansions. And when you take a look at those targeted expansions, we're doing well. We think we're bringing more focus. And from a frequency and visit standpoint, the type of successful model that we've implemented in the U.S. From an instrument and business-focused standpoint, we've seen excellent results in premium instrument placements to pick 19% on the Catalyst side, really strong, the quality has been really strong from both competitive and new placements. And so we're optimistic. And I think the regions are working or other countries within the regions are working through their specific challenges. But we're optimistic that the long-term demand is there.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Great, thanks. And then for the follow-up, going back to the organic growth guide for the year and some of your assumptions on vet visit growth. I think previously, you'd said that on the high end of the guide, you're baking in a relative flattening of clinical vet visit growth trends as you work through the year. And as you said, you kind of saw them in the first quarter already. So what do you need to see from vet visit sort of quite a chance to say, okay, we're here already, things have definitely improved ready to revise upward? Is that just a matter of seeing these trends continue for another quarter or so? Or is there something that you saw in between the numbers that give you pause?\nBrian McKeon: Maybe I can provide a little color there. On the U.S. side, where we're more explicit on how we're thinking about the visit trends, as I mentioned the overall, it was -- clinical visits were relatively flat in the quarter. I think we are encouraged that it appears that we're working through the headwinds that were related to capacity staffing. So that seems to be normalizing. I would point out it was stronger earlier in Q1 than how we exited the quarter. So the visits were down a bit in March, and that continued into early April. So I think this is an ongoing dynamic in terms of just the macro backdrop and the ongoing adaptation of clinics to adding staff and kind of getting back to their normal growth rates. But I think we're feeling good about kind of working through some of those headwinds that we highlighted. And an area that we'll continue to monitor and we're actively trying to help clinics through productivity improvement, get back to the positive growth rates that they've been able to support in the past.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, to Brian's point, the practices from our perspective, speaking now to the U.S. have largely stabilized. We've seen stabilization of ours, for example. I think there's been a really strong appetite and enthusiasm for technology, specifically with a focus on productivity and supporting capacity. Certainly, we've seen heightened interest in software as a way of supporting staff productivity, workflow optimization, removing the sort of high administrative unrewarded tasks. Keep in mind, if you take a look at 2022, there was a 2% net addition in pets in the U.S. That's twice the level pre-pandemic. So I think there's a lot of underserved demand out there, and practices are working through, how they serve that demand. So good progress. I think the other thing is finding the time study, we think identify some things that practices are doing and could do, and there's been a lot of receptivity and enthusiasm for that work and how they can find a couple of minutes here, a couple of minutes there that cumulatively make a big difference.\nMichael Ryskin: Got it, really helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.\nJack Senft: Yes, hey guys, this is Jack Senft on for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking my question. I have two just pretty quick ones. First, can you remind us on the ProCyte One placement goals, replacements goal. I believe the 20,000 goal is for 2026, correct? So I believe in your prepared remarks, you said that you're already over that -- you're already over 50% to that target. So just curious if you can touch on the good performance in these placements that seems to be almost ahead of schedule. And then two, do you expect the adoption to slow down? Or is there a good amount of upside potential to that 20,000 target? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So let me address the -- so we had said that we have 9,400 ProCyte One placements, which is nearly half of the goal itself. And I think what we're seeing is a really nice fit with the platform itself from both performance and cost and footprint standpoint. So there's been a lot of, I think customer adoption based on the fact that it fits their practice needs. Keep in mind, internationally which is where we think the larger part of the marketplace is, in many countries, it's hematology first. They do sort of a general body systems diagnostic and then, in some cases, include chemistry or may include chemistry with it. So it does hematology first marketplace. They see this as a key addition to their in-clinic diagnostics suite. And we've done well with that.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, I'd just highlight the multiplier benefits to the ProCyte One launch. If you look at the growth in the overall installed base, we had double-digit growth across Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue. So it's -- and we had a very strong quarter for Catalyst and SediVue placements, building on the lapping of the launch last year that was very successful for ProCyte One. So I think the benefit of having additions to a platform isn't just related to the platform itself but the overall business growth.\nJack Senft: Perfect. Understood. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. Over the past few quarters, the narrative of cloud within the animal health industry seems to have accelerated. And just given the financial hardships that practices currently face, can you just talk about the pricing differences between average cloud-based solutions versus like on-prem or hardware solutions? And then for new practices starting up, are they typically going just right into the cloud? Or I guess like what is the opportunity here? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So new practices are generally going right into the cloud. So they're trying to buy and use contemporary technology. Cloud-based systems are obviously priced as SaaS services. So there's a monthly annuity. There's still upfront costs in terms of data migration and onboarding and training and those things associated with getting a practice. I think the big difference from a cost standpoint at least is in the life cycle of the solution itself. The practice system had to worry about replacing servers every three, four, five years and paying for ongoing maintenance. The other big benefit is they get software updates pushed to them on a pretty frequent basis without having to necessarily send somebody out to the site and take the system offline, whether it's a couple of hours or more. So there's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of cost benefits over the life cycle of the solution as well as feature functionality improvements that they get. And therefore, that's driving, I think at least in the veterinary industry a newfound appreciation for updating the more modern or contemporary software solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Sorry, hopefully, you can hear me now. So...\nBrian McKeon: Hey Erin, we missed the beginning of -- yes sorry, we missed the beginning.\nErin Wright: No worries. No worries. So can you talk a little bit about the pet oncology diagnostics opportunity? Why does it make sense for you to partner in this category versus buy? And do you think that this could be a more meaningful driver for you longer term or more limited? Just curious how you're thinking about that at this juncture? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Thank you, Erin. We think it's a very significant opportunity, just based on the number of pets that develop cancer. So it's the biggest cause of death, mortality of within the pet population. So if you take a look at the U.S., there's six million dogs a year that get cancer, 3x mortality rate of the next sort of greatest cause of death. The diagnosis and staging and treatment protocols today are very fragmented. They tend to be late by the time it's very clinically obvious and then you have to pick the sample and send it out to the pathology lab. And at that point, cancer may be Stage 3, Stage 4 difficult to treat. The other piece is that there aren't a lot of oncology specialists. If you take a look at North America, it's 350 to 400. So most of the camps are diagnosing, and treatment is happening through the general practitioner who aren't specialists. They have a lot of other responsibilities. And so being able to provide diagnostics as a testing regime for them, we think is a really attractive opportunity, we both partner and have internal development efforts. Keep in mind that from a cancer standpoint, just our pathology submissions on a global basis, over 1.3 million a year. So this isn't a new area for us. This is something that we're well versed in and provide a service across the globe for us. So this is just really expanding or enhancing so that we move earlier into being able to support our customers to diagnose cancer while it's still -- you have better chances at being able to treat it.\nErin Wright: Great. And on -- I know you commented a little bit on the Heska Mars deal. But do you anticipate more opportunities in terms of corporate relationships coming up outside of, obviously, Mars? And with a couple of their relationships on the Heska side coming up for bid within the next year, is that meaningful at all? What's the competitive response? Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes, I mean we have -- generally, we have relationships with both corporate accounts across some of our different testing modalities or product lines. We do think there are some customers who may be sensitive continuing with our competitors. It still comes down. It's a very competitive market. It still comes down to -- we're going to have to compete customer to customer. And we think that the broadest possible solution to support their growth objectives is what, at the end of the day, wins. And we'll continue to focus on that.\nErin Wright: Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question comes from David Westenberg from Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking the question here. Sorry, if it went over my head in terms of the FX here. I think on the change in guide, it was from 500 -- or 50 basis points on revenue to 200 -- to 20 basis points on revenue. but then on EPS, it went up. Sorry, I might be a little thickheaded here. Can you explain what's happening on the top line? I think of you as an exporter. So I'm just a little bit confused there. I know you've given commentary, but maybe I'm a little slower than others. And then I'll just ask my second one upfront here. Can you talk about -- again, another one on the Mars Heska thing, but I want to go at a different angle. Your win rate against Antech has been pretty high. And at least my checks from -- with veterinarians tend to see that they kind of have -- don't like going against their competitor. So is there any chance you can have additional win rates in the inside lab here with kind of that angle and kind of how to think about that dynamic? Thank you very much.\nBrian McKeon: Yes. So David, just on your FX questions, you're correct on revenue. We think the full-year is relatively flat now versus what we thought was a 0.5 point headwind. That's the $10 million positive adjustment in revenue. It didn't flow through to EPS, just given mix of currencies and hedge positions. So it's -- we have a share of all the assumptions relative to rates, but we have a model that we go through looking at all those factors, and it didn't have a net impact just because we're largely hedged at this point, and just the mix of the impacts weren't as favorable.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. And then to answer the -- your second question, we don't think about it necessarily as migration of one modality to the other based on the competitive landscape. Customers use both clinic as well as reference labs. They choose partners based on a variety of your product and solution differentiation, cost, service, footprint, all those things. So we think there's still going to be the primary drivers of who corporate customers and independent customers choose, and I'll leave it at that. So with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. And to summarize, I'll reiterate that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal health care. We look forward to executing our organic strategy to address this opportunity. IDEXX teams continued to perform at a high level building of the investments we made over the past decades to develop our sector. And we look forward to continuing strong progress against our strategy through 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. IDEXX had a solid start to 2023. In terms of highlights for the quarter, overall revenues increased 10% organically, supported by nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were driven by nearly 14% organic growth in the U.S. supported by solid volume gains and benefits from the higher net price realization. Key execution metrics remained strong globally reflected in record first quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 18% on a comparable basis reflecting solid organic revenue growth, better than expected gross margin gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. These strong results reflect the durability and resiliency of the IDEXX business model and benefits from our ongoing focus on execution. We've incorporated our Q1 results in positive adjustments to our full-year financial outlook which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and solid 8% growth in Water. Overall organic revenue gains were moderated by 2% declines in our LPD business and approximately $4 million of revenue headwind related to lower human COVID testing revenues, a business area that we winded down completely in Q1. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 12% organically reflecting 14% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8% to 9% range, consistent with our expectations. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 7% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a 1,350 basis point growth premium compared to relatively flat same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels in Q1. These results reflected benefits from execution drivers including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from these drivers were moderated by impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 12% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth on our global premium instrument installed base reflecting double-digit increases across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,425 CAG premium instruments in Q1, an increase of 3% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels building on the record placement levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflected 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally reflecting in a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 12% organically driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 11% organically reflecting strong gains in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in international, with growth in key international regions moderated by macro-economic impacts, which have pressured same-store sales. In terms of other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition has progressed well expanding our capabilities in Water safety testing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 2% organically as solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were offset by comparisons to high prior year sales levels in herd health screening and reduced revenues from non-core food and safety products in certain regions. Turning to the P&L, Q1 profit results were supported by a 150 basis point improvement in reported operating margins reflecting 10% organic revenue growth, solid gross profit gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.3% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Later timing of lab staffing increases and select operational upsides also supported Q1 gross profit results. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 50 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, including lapping of prior year hedge gains. Operating expenses increased 5% year-on-year as reported in the quarter and 7% on a comparable basis. This was net of a $16 million or 6% operating expense growth offset related to the customer contract resolution payment. As planned, we saw higher growth in sales & marketing and R&D expense in the quarter related to specific factors including the return of in-person sales meetings this year and advancement of key innovation initiatives. EPS was $2.55 per share in Q1, an increase of 12% as reported and 18% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $12 million and EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Free cash flow was $144 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 65%. For the full-year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 1x net of cash down modestly from Q4 levels. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1.9% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the first quarter, as we manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full-year outlook to incorporate our solid Q1 operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We're updating our full-year guidance for reported revenues to $3,615 million to $3,700 million, this includes a $10 million positive adjustment for foreign exchange impacts, which we now estimate will provide a relatively modest full-year headwind to reported revenue growth. Our updated outlook for overall organic revenue growth is 7.5% to 10%. Our Q1 results tracked towards the high end of this range and we're maintaining consistent high-end targets for our performance this year, reflecting benefits from execution drivers and the potential for reduced clinical visit growth headwinds. As part of our financial management approach, we incorporated risk estimates to our targeted growth performance in the low end of our organic revenue growth range, including potential effects from macro-economic conditions. We raised the low end of our full-year organic revenue growth outlook by 0.5% in our updated guidance, incorporating our solid start to the year. We're maintaining our outlook for solid operating margin performance in 2023 with an expectation for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5% for the full-year. At the high-end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. We now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year slightly higher than earlier projections, which included impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.33 to $9.75 per share, reflecting a $0.06 per share increase in our low-end estimate. We continue to estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.23 for the full-year with the bulk of this impact in the first half. In terms of our operational outlook for Q2, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth consistent with the midpoint to higher end of our full-year growth outlook range with approximately 1% of reported growth headwind from year-on-year FX changes. In terms of Q2 operating margins, we're planning for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margin performance year-on-year adjusting for about 70 basis points in negative foreign exchange impacts and benefits from comparisons to prior year results, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. We've provided details on our updated outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshot. Overall, we're applying a disciplined financial approach that advances our growth strategy and mitigates potential macro risks to ensure delivery of continued strong financial performance. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your question. We have a similar outlook at the high-end. I think we feel very good about the start to the year, particularly in the U.S. And so I think the drivers of that, we highlighted pricing being a positive driver for us this year and the execution is consistent with what we had expected. And I think the executional drivers that help to deliver solid volume growth in the U.S., we're very encouraged by. And looking to build on that. I think internationally, we also saw excellent execution drivers I mentioned, we had double-digit growth benefit from things like new business gains, including benefits from strong instrument placements, higher pricing. We are seeing continued headwinds from macro factors in international markets. So the growth was somewhat below our higher end target so on balance, we feel a good start to the year. I still think that's a good full-year goal for the company and looking forward to continuing to execute well to deliver against it. Yes, let me try to break that down. We had an expectation for the first quarter for an improvement in reported operating margins of 50 to 100 basis points. We came in at 150. So that was better than expected. That was principally on the gross margin line. We saw some benefit in the quarter from kind of later than time planned staffing in areas like our labs and some specific operational factors more Q1 related. So I think we feel good about the overall performance and do think that the high-end goals that we have are still appropriate. As we highlighted coming into the year, we knew that we had some costs coming back here, just more interface with our customers, more travel I think we're anticipating that to continue. We're trying to support our employees in a higher inflation environment as well. And we do have investments that we're advancing in areas like R&D. I know we've highlighted in the past a couple of new platforms that we're advancing that we're investing behind. So those are all captured in our outlook. I think on balance, our performance is very much in line with what we're targeting again, a good start to the year. And we think the full-year goal is on an -- if we adjust out the R&D lapping and the customer contract resolution payment for a solid 60 basis point comparable improvement and right in line with what we were hoping to achieve this year, and we look forward to working to deliver on that. Yes, thanks for the question, Jon. We did have a really good start to the year in the U.S. I think our pricing, as you pointed out was globally in line with what we had planned. So we feel good about the execution there. I would say the U.S. clinical visits were overall for the quarter a little better than we anticipated. They were flat, as I mentioned, and we thought we'd still be working through some compares on that front. I think we got some benefit really early in the quarter, I think with some positive growth that helped there. And the -- our own volume execution, the difference between how much growth is coming from our volume relative to clinical visits was a solid 5%, that's kind of pre-pandemic level. So we -- that was in line with kind of where we're hoping to achieve. So on balance, U.S. combined came through quite well. I think international was in line, I would say with what we were guiding towards. We had very good execution as noted and continue to see some macro headwinds that we're working through. So on balance, I think we feel good about the start to the year, as I shared earlier. And we have some goals at the higher end that would help us deliver 10% overall organic growth, which is our goal and we think we're working well towards that. And we're acknowledging that we're in an environment where there is some macro risk, and we think it's proven to have a range of estimates there and continue to monitor those trends as we work through the year. But I think on balance, we feel good about the start. Yes, just to clarify on the profit guide, our operating margin outlook is consistent. We have a slightly higher headwind from FX. And so on a comparable basis, the high end is the same and the low end is up, I think slightly. We obviously have some positive flow-through from raising the low end of the revenue. So that's the EPS adjustment. And you're correct. We had lower interest expense projected to offset by relatively lower projected reductions in shares outstanding. So that was a net flat effect. Yes, let me clarify the numbers. I'll let Jay talk to the regional dynamics. It was 8% -- 7.6% CAG Dx recurring. And Mike, I would say that's pretty much in line with the outlook that we shared for the quarter. I think the execution drivers were very -- were strong, in line. We had 17% growth in instrument placements, double-digit benefit from things that weren't related to same-store sales dynamics. And we continue to see the kind of pressure that we've seen on macro -- for macro trends on the same-store side. But we've been building that into our outlook, and I think that was in line with what we were anticipating and kind of consistent with our full-year view as well. Maybe I can provide a little color there. On the U.S. side, where we're more explicit on how we're thinking about the visit trends, as I mentioned the overall, it was -- clinical visits were relatively flat in the quarter. I think we are encouraged that it appears that we're working through the headwinds that were related to capacity staffing. So that seems to be normalizing. I would point out it was stronger earlier in Q1 than how we exited the quarter. So the visits were down a bit in March, and that continued into early April. So I think this is an ongoing dynamic in terms of just the macro backdrop and the ongoing adaptation of clinics to adding staff and kind of getting back to their normal growth rates. But I think we're feeling good about kind of working through some of those headwinds that we highlighted. And an area that we'll continue to monitor and we're actively trying to help clinics through productivity improvement, get back to the positive growth rates that they've been able to support in the past. Yes, I'd just highlight the multiplier benefits to the ProCyte One launch. If you look at the growth in the overall installed base, we had double-digit growth across Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue. So it's -- and we had a very strong quarter for Catalyst and SediVue placements, building on the lapping of the launch last year that was very successful for ProCyte One. So I think the benefit of having additions to a platform isn't just related to the platform itself but the overall business growth. Hey Erin, we missed the beginning of -- yes sorry, we missed the beginning. Yes. So David, just on your FX questions, you're correct on revenue. We think the full-year is relatively flat now versus what we thought was a 0.5 point headwind. That's the $10 million positive adjustment in revenue. It didn't flow through to EPS, just given mix of currencies and hedge positions. So it's -- we have a share of all the assumptions relative to rates, but we have a model that we go through looking at all those factors, and it didn't have a net impact just because we're largely hedged at this point, and just the mix of the impacts weren't as favorable."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX had a very strong start to 2023, driven by sustained execution of our growth strategy. Demand for Companion Animal medical services continues to grow, supported by IDEXX innovation and direct customer engagement. Veterinarians continue to focus on meeting these high levels of demand with the best possible medical care, with diagnostics as an essential component of this care equation. IDEXX remains a chosen, trusted partner to veterinarians who appreciate how our world-class products and connected ecosystem enable high standards of care, while resulting in growth of a significant profit center within their clinics. IDEXX's strong execution is reflected in double-digit total company organic revenue growth, supported by strong expansion of global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Growth in this recurring revenue annuity was supported by solid contribution for new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates, and net price realization aligned with our expectations. Our commercial teams drove another record quarter for global premium instrument placements and excellent levels of cloud-based software placements. IDEXX products and services offer solutions to improve clinic productivity and support the significantly expanded and underserved demand we've seen for pet healthcare in recent years including net pet additions in the U.S. of 2% in 2022, twice the pre-pandemic trend line. These efforts supported strong IDEXX growth as we continue to work effectively through the near-term sector headwinds related to clinic, capacity constraints, and global macro conditions. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX's sustained execution against our strategy to drive the adoption and utilization of diagnostics help deliver continued strong financial results. First, I'll provide an update on our commercial execution, which through education and customer engagement drives relevant utilization of IDEXX's innovative solutions. IDEXX commercial teams delivered another record first quarter global premium instrument placements to start 2023, building on very strong prior year results. Our commercial teams demonstrated a continued ability to advance placement, quantity and quality. This is reflected in strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally driving solid EVI achievement. These commercial results are highly encouraging as we address the significant opportunity for an estimated 220,000 worldwide premium instrument placements and give us confidence that we have the right strategic playbook in place. IDEXX professionals provide world-class, software-enabled products that are in high demand, and supported by a wide menu of customer-friendly marketing programs that enable adoption of new technology. These results also reflect continued strong clinical interest in using IDEXX's products and services, to not only meet the increased demand for pet healthcare, but to deliver the best possible level of care. Our commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits that flow from IDEXX innovations as evidenced by the success of our newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides customers with an attractive in-clinic hematology solution, its small footprint, easy pay-per-run model, and lower cost come without sacrificing CBC performance. IDEXX premium placements have benefited from strong ProCyte One adoption to date thanks to sustained high attach rates with Catalyst, as defined by ProCyte One placements either with a Catalyst or at an existing Catalyst customer. The result is a multiplier benefit, supported by clinics who choose to outfit their in-clinic suite with IDEXX products. As a result, we are nearly halfway to the incremental 20,000 premium hematology placement objective we shared at Investor Day following ProCyte One's launch, while the strong attach rates should also help IDEXX penetrate the long-term worldwide placement opportunity. Key to developing this long-term opportunity will be increasing customer engagement in international regions. We're leveraging our successful VDC model to build strong relationships with international customers, as evidenced by sustained strong new business gains and a 19% increase in Catalyst placements. This strong performance is allowing us to deliver solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in international regions, despite continued macro headwinds, which are pressured same-store clinical visit levels. Customer engagement remains excellent as evidenced by high reach to revenue levels in the first quarter, including benefits from our expanded commercial sales force in targeted regions. The flywheel is beginning to turn in these countries, where we've seen excellent gains from new business, strong interest in engaging with customer marketing programs, and solid overall volume growth. Commercial expansion is an important early step in our international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize our reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One, and drive further adoption of software tools like VetConnect PLUS, our cloud-based diagnostic portal. Software innovation continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy globally. IDEXX software solutions are a key enabler of diagnostics utilization, creating a connected ecosystem that helps improve diagnostics workflow, while providing deeper clinical insights and supporting pet-owner communication. It's an attractive standalone business as well. Strong PIMS placements in the first quarter were supported by continued preference for cloud-native products, with IDEXX well-positioned to address this trend. Placements of cloud-based products maintained the strong velocity we saw coming out of 2022 and represented greater than 90% of total placements supported by continued high interest in our ezyVet and Neo solutions, which are seamlessly integrated into our product offering. This provides customers with options when it comes to picking the best, most relevant PIMS solution for their clinic size and workflow complexity. Our strong first quarter placement performance supported double-digit recurring revenue growth with an attractive gross margin profile and we're on track to achieve this year a PIMS footprint that is over 50% cloud-based. This milestone is especially important in the current veterinary clinic environment, where productivity is a priority in addressing the sustained high levels of demand seen through the pandemic. By embracing IDEXX's cloud-based ecosystem, customers gain the advantage of an easy-to-use software stack that touches every area of the veterinary clinic. And the benefit of these tools is enduring for our customers, evidenced by strong engagement metrics across applications -- including increasing rates of our Web PACS user base that are power users as well as sustained rates of VetConnect PLUS users who use the software as part of their daily routine. Adoption and continued use of these products allows veterinarians and their staffs to spend more time focusing on the care they deliver to their patients rather than on costly, time-intensive administrative activities. Our software strategy is to increase cloud-adoption and build increased business and clinical functionality into IDEXX software solutions. Another use case of our innovation agenda is our 4Dx Plus Test, the gold standard test for canine vector-borne disease testing. The current 4Dx Plus Test is our fourth version on a multiplexed canine vector-borne disease diagnostics over the past 20 plus years with improved sensitivity of Anaplasma and 2x increase in the ability to store the product at room temperature. This is a true testament to our Technology for Life strategy and supported 12% global organic rapid assay recurring revenue growth and solid customer gains in the first quarter. A full vector-borne screen using 4Dx Plus is recommended over a Heartworm-only test given significant increases in incidence and prevalence of vector-borne diseases over the past 10 plus years. And yet, in 2022 less than one in every five dogs received this comprehensive level of testing. 4Dx Plus enables veterinarians to deliver this higher standard of care, with follow-up testing and care protocol guidance provided through DecisionIQ, which aim to drive better health outcomes, while encouraging increased diagnostic testing. Furthermore, our entire rapid assay franchise is supported by the SNAP Pro analyzer. The analyzer not only simplifies the workflow when running a SNAP test, but also ensures the diagnostic results flow seamlessly to VetConnect PLUS and ultimately result in charge capture and invoicing at the point of sale. This is a clear case of how our products, integral components of our connected software ecosystem, improve in value over time, while delivering a multiplier benefit to our customers and drive IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. The sustained execution against our commercial and innovation agendas is made possible by an unrelenting focus on our customers and ensuring they have world-class experience with IDEXX. This takes multiple forms, all focused to ensure our customers and the resources they need to provide the best possible levels of medical care. Continued 99% plus product availability and reliable, fast reference lab service turnaround times provide them with important business continuity and are the result of our investment in manufacturing and supply chain logistics teams, facilities, and relationships. Additionally, the support of the high-touch, highly knowledgeable sales teams that we have built out over the decades ensures they have the products and services that are right for their busy clinics. Our customers realize the benefits of the IDEXX partnership every day, and in turn reward us with their business and their enduring loyalty, as measured by another quarter of consistent, high customer retention rates. Providing our customers with reliable, consistent support is even more essential right now given the dynamic backdrop of our sector. High demand for animal medical services combined with sustained labor supply constraints continue to create productivity and growth challenges at the clinic level. Taking our customer support efforts a step further, we recently published an empirically based study, which examines the drivers of productivity within a practice and helps customers to understand their productivity strengths and areas for opportunities. Through this rigorous effort we found three key drivers of practice productivity. Number one workflow, which includes staffing models like optimized technician to veterinarian mix, and staff and patient friendly physical layout of the practice. Number two technology or digitizing each step of the patient workflow to remove high effort administrative routines. Number three the role of culture including clarity of roles and responsibilities, investments in training and staff effectiveness, and aligned incentives to drive teamwork and achievement of practice goals. As a result of this initiative, we believe there is still a great opportunity for clinics to improve productivity measures and we look forward to educating and supporting our customers in these efforts. Opportunities to do so could result in 30% or more incremental visit capacity, even for practices that are in the top cohort of productivity. We are integrating elements of these efforts into our strategy and commercial approach this year. With that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for the commitment and passion they bring to our purpose-driven work every day. Your efforts not only help provide a better future for animals, people, and our planet, but you also supported IDEXX in starting 2023 on a strong financial note. We have an attractive sector and a strong track record, and the opportunity ahead of us, which is significant is to work with our customers to elevate companion animal healthcare standards through increased diagnostics utilization. The tireless work of the IDEXX team has positioned us well to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. Now, let's open the line for Q&A. Hi, Nate. Yes. Good morning, Chris. This is Jay. So let me take your second question first, and then I'll address the acquisition. Overall, we think pricing to our customers is appropriate within the current environment. From an overall demand standpoint, we see that holding up well relative to the macro conditions, as we've described it in the different pricing scenarios. From just a pet owner perspective, we think they've demonstrated and willingness. We see this both from experience as well as just the survey work that they continue to prioritize health care for their pets. And keep in mind that diagnostics is a relatively small piece of the overall patient spend on their pets. Specifically to your point around wellness versus non-wellness, we've seen the two pretty much move in lockstep over the last five quarters. Or so of course, if the macro -- when we see sort of the macro deterioration from an environmental standpoint during the pandemic, there was some divergence. But generally, at least over the last year plus, they've moved in lockstep. And just an interesting, I think proof point of that, if you take a look at the 4Dx diagnostics testing, it's been highly durable. That's primarily a wellness test and we think indicative of the good end customer demand and pull-through. From the standpoint of the Mars Heska acquisition, just as a matter of policy, we don't comment on specific customer relationships, except to say that no single customer comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Our customer base is very large and diversified. I think as you know and we maintain and have excellent relationships and a great long-term track record with our corporate customers. They, I think very much appreciate the broad solution portfolio both on the diagnostics as well as software side where we can support their objectives to grow and deliver great care. And it probably just as importantly, footprint-wise to be where there. I think the acquisition itself reflects what we've said all along the attractiveness of the animal health sector and more specifically, diagnostics that we think \u2013 long-term, that it can help support the overall market or sector development of diagnostics. Yes, we can. Yes. And I would just build on that to say that I would build on Brian's comments and just emphasize the excellent commercial drivers that we've talked about certainly pricing, as Brian mentioned, new customer acquisition has been strong, both U.S. and internationally. Customer retention rates continue to remain strong. I think the customer interest and appetite for technology, we see that in premium instrument placements as well as software. And I think that's really reflective of the -- some of the capacity challenges that they see. So overall, I think from an execution standpoint, a very strong quarter. And I would just say from a product development standpoint, I'm not going to be specific, obviously, but we are running parallel programs. We continue to invest in software assays, instruments. We spend a lot of money on innovation. We think there's great opportunities across the portfolio and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer. Yes. I mean just to support that, we've seen relatively speaking, more macro impacts outside the U.S. As I had mentioned previously, our execution drivers internationally have been excellent. We've done seven commercial expansions. And when you take a look at those targeted expansions, we're doing well. We think we're bringing more focus. And from a frequency and visit standpoint, the type of successful model that we've implemented in the U.S. From an instrument and business-focused standpoint, we've seen excellent results in premium instrument placements to pick 19% on the Catalyst side, really strong, the quality has been really strong from both competitive and new placements. And so we're optimistic. And I think the regions are working or other countries within the regions are working through their specific challenges. But we're optimistic that the long-term demand is there. Yes, to Brian's point, the practices from our perspective, speaking now to the U.S. have largely stabilized. We've seen stabilization of ours, for example. I think there's been a really strong appetite and enthusiasm for technology, specifically with a focus on productivity and supporting capacity. Certainly, we've seen heightened interest in software as a way of supporting staff productivity, workflow optimization, removing the sort of high administrative unrewarded tasks. Keep in mind, if you take a look at 2022, there was a 2% net addition in pets in the U.S. That's twice the level pre-pandemic. So I think there's a lot of underserved demand out there, and practices are working through, how they serve that demand. So good progress. I think the other thing is finding the time study, we think identify some things that practices are doing and could do, and there's been a lot of receptivity and enthusiasm for that work and how they can find a couple of minutes here, a couple of minutes there that cumulatively make a big difference. Yes. So let me address the -- so we had said that we have 9,400 ProCyte One placements, which is nearly half of the goal itself. And I think what we're seeing is a really nice fit with the platform itself from both performance and cost and footprint standpoint. So there's been a lot of, I think customer adoption based on the fact that it fits their practice needs. Keep in mind, internationally which is where we think the larger part of the marketplace is, in many countries, it's hematology first. They do sort of a general body systems diagnostic and then, in some cases, include chemistry or may include chemistry with it. So it does hematology first marketplace. They see this as a key addition to their in-clinic diagnostics suite. And we've done well with that. Yes. So new practices are generally going right into the cloud. So they're trying to buy and use contemporary technology. Cloud-based systems are obviously priced as SaaS services. So there's a monthly annuity. There's still upfront costs in terms of data migration and onboarding and training and those things associated with getting a practice. I think the big difference from a cost standpoint at least is in the life cycle of the solution itself. The practice system had to worry about replacing servers every three, four, five years and paying for ongoing maintenance. The other big benefit is they get software updates pushed to them on a pretty frequent basis without having to necessarily send somebody out to the site and take the system offline, whether it's a couple of hours or more. So there's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of cost benefits over the life cycle of the solution as well as feature functionality improvements that they get. And therefore, that's driving, I think at least in the veterinary industry a newfound appreciation for updating the more modern or contemporary software solutions. Yes. Thank you, Erin. We think it's a very significant opportunity, just based on the number of pets that develop cancer. So it's the biggest cause of death, mortality of within the pet population. So if you take a look at the U.S., there's six million dogs a year that get cancer, 3x mortality rate of the next sort of greatest cause of death. The diagnosis and staging and treatment protocols today are very fragmented. They tend to be late by the time it's very clinically obvious and then you have to pick the sample and send it out to the pathology lab. And at that point, cancer may be Stage 3, Stage 4 difficult to treat. The other piece is that there aren't a lot of oncology specialists. If you take a look at North America, it's 350 to 400. So most of the camps are diagnosing, and treatment is happening through the general practitioner who aren't specialists. They have a lot of other responsibilities. And so being able to provide diagnostics as a testing regime for them, we think is a really attractive opportunity, we both partner and have internal development efforts. Keep in mind that from a cancer standpoint, just our pathology submissions on a global basis, over 1.3 million a year. So this isn't a new area for us. This is something that we're well versed in and provide a service across the globe for us. So this is just really expanding or enhancing so that we move earlier into being able to support our customers to diagnose cancer while it's still -- you have better chances at being able to treat it. Yes, I mean we have -- generally, we have relationships with both corporate accounts across some of our different testing modalities or product lines. We do think there are some customers who may be sensitive continuing with our competitors. It still comes down. It's a very competitive market. It still comes down to -- we're going to have to compete customer to customer. And we think that the broadest possible solution to support their growth objectives is what, at the end of the day, wins. And we'll continue to focus on that. Yes. And then to answer the -- your second question, we don't think about it necessarily as migration of one modality to the other based on the competitive landscape. Customers use both clinic as well as reference labs. They choose partners based on a variety of your product and solution differentiation, cost, service, footprint, all those things. So we think there's still going to be the primary drivers of who corporate customers and independent customers choose, and I'll leave it at that. So with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. And to summarize, I'll reiterate that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal health care. We look forward to executing our organic strategy to address this opportunity. IDEXX teams continued to perform at a high level building of the investments we made over the past decades to develop our sector. And we look forward to continuing strong progress against our strategy through 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the third quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 6% organically supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 13% organic growth in our water business. Organic revenue gains were supported by benefits from IDEXX execution drivers reflected in consistent solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and double-digit growth in our premium instrument install base. While not reported in our quarterly results, IDEXX secured nearly 700 orders for our new In View Analyzer which supported strong growth in EVI metrics that will position the company to build on this momentum, partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was constrained by impacts from near-term US macro and sector headwinds. As we'll discuss, we're updating our full year organic revenue growth guidance to reflect expectations for continued near-term macro and sectoral pressure in the US and to incorporate estimated negative impacts from recent severe weather events. IDEXX continues to deliver strong profit performance as we work through these dynamics reflected in solid comparable operating margin gains in Q3, keeping us on track to achieve our full year operating margin goals. Solid revenue growth and operating margin gains supported EPS of $2.80 per share in Q3, up 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 6% was driven by 6% organic revenue gains in our CAG business and 13% organic growth in water; partially offset by 2% organic declines in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 6% organic gains in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue decreased 9% organically reflecting comparisons to record prior year placement levels and near-term impacts from our commercial focus on IDEXX in view order generation, which will primarily benefit 2025 reported instrument revenues worldwide. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. This includes approximately 1% of global equivalent day growth benefit in the quarter related to increased shipping days in our in-Clinic Business. Q3 CAG Diagnostic Recurring revenue growth was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 5% with US. net price realization of approximately 4%. US net price realization includes impacts from the successful extension and expansion of three major customer agreements in 2024. These agreements will provide long-term incremental volume growth benefits for IDEXX as we expand our business relationships with these customers. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the third quarter was supported by 10% international organic gains. International growth reflected benefits from net price realization, continued solid volume gains and approximately 0.5% of positive equivalent days effects. International growth was driven by IDEXX execution reflected in continued strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of a global premium instrument install base. US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 5% in Q3 including approximately 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. US growth was supported by continued solid positive growth contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX's US growth expanded at a solid premium to comparable US same store clinical visit growth levels. In the US. we continue to work through macro and sector dynamics which contributed to a 2.1% decline in same store clinical visit growth in Q3, including a relatively higher 3.4% same store decline and more discretionary wellness visits. Overall US clinical visit growth levels include an estimated 1% to 1.5% growth benefit from the ramping of pain medication visits over the last year, which typically do not include diagnostics. This is added to the near-term clinical visit headwind effect for IDEXX's US CAG business. For pets visiting US clinics, pet owners continue to demonstrate interest in a higher standard of care despite macro pressures. If we adjust US Sector metrics for the estimated pain medication impact on clinical visits and diagnostic frequency, we continue to see an increase in the percentage of visits that include at least one diagnostic. Over the last 12 months, the percentage of clinical visits with core blood work inclusion has also sustained at elevated levels following the accelerated expansion seen during the pandemic. These trends reinforce that the primary headwind to IDEXX's growth in the near-term remains pressure on clinical visit growth. Given recent trends and our updated full year organic growth outlook, we factored in expectations for continued near-term constraints on CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth from US macro and sector impacts. IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic growth and strong financial performance as we work through these near-term headwinds. We're highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation as we continue to execute towards our business strategy aligned with raising standards of pet healthcare globally. In terms of growth by modality, third quarter results were supported by strong global gains in consumable revenues. At IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically reflecting double digit gains in the US and international regions including benefits from increased equivalent shipping days effects. Consumable gains were supported by 10% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We achieved 4,128 CAG global premium instrument replacements in Q3, a decrease of 443 units or approximately 10% compared to record prior year levels, while securing 691 orders for our new IDEXX in view analyzer in North America. We're on track for initiation of shipments of in view in Q4 with expectations for approximately 50 to 100 shipments this year with the bulk of the advance orders targeted for delivery in 2025. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 6% organically in the third quarter reflecting solid global gains including benefits from net price realization and positive equivalent shipping Days effects. Global lab revenues increased 2% organically in Q3 net of a modest equivalent days headwind reflecting low single digit gains in the US and solid growth in international regions. Reference Lab results adjusted for days effects were supported by modest volume growth aided by new business gains which offset pressures related to macro and sector conditions constraining same store sales levels. Net price gains in our Reference Lab line of business in Q3 were moderated by impacts from major new customer agreements which will benefit long-term. Reference Lab Growth Veterinary Software services and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 11% as reported including benefits from our recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 6% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software solutions. Water revenues increased 13% organically in Q3 supported by double digit gains in the US and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 2% organically as strong gains in the US were offset by lower Asia swine testing and herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.1% of 140 basis points on a comparable basis gross margin gains reflect favorable business mix including benefits from high growth and consumable revenues, lower instrument costs and favorable impacts from growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues. Operating expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis and 8% on a comparable basis. OpEx growth was driven by increases in sales and marketing expense and RD spending aligned with advancing our growth and innovation agenda. Operating margins were 31.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points year-on-year as reported and 100 basis points on a comparable basis. EPS was $2.80 per share in Q3, an increase of 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange increased revenue and operating profit by approximately $1 million and EPS by approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter net of a $1 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $192 million in Q3. On a trailing twelve-month basis. Our net income to free cash to a conversion ratio was 91%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% while updating our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $160 million, reflecting lower projected spend and project timing. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. In the third quarter, we allocated 225 million in capital to share repurchases, supporting a 1.1% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year overall organic revenue growth outlook to 5.3% to 6% and our outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to 5.8% to 6.4%. At midpoint, this reflects a reduction of 1% to 1.5% compared to our prior full year organic revenue growth outlook, primarily driven by recent US Macro and sector trends, constraining visits and demand at the clinic level. This outlook incorporates Q3 results and reflects expectations for continued pressure on US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4 related to macro and sector trends and recent severe weather impacts in Q4 at midpoint. The updated outlook reflects expectations for overall organic revenue growth of approximately 3%. This aligns with a Q4 midpoint expectation for global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% net of an estimated 0.5% of negative effect from severe weather impacts in the US. We expect global net price improvement and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues of approximately 4% to 4.5% in Q4, including effects from new business agreements. With a consistent outlook for approximately 5% full year global net price realization. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.865 billion to $3.890 billion, a reduction of $38 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent FX estimates. In terms of our profit guidance, our outlook for 28.7% to 29% in reported operating margins reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement. Our full year reported margin outlook incorporates effects from the discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in Q2, which will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. Excluding this impact and FX effects at midpoint, our operating margin outlook reflects a consistent 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year eps outlook of $10.37 to $10.53 per share is consistent with our prior EPS guidance at midpoint. At midpoint we've incorporated approximately $0.14 and negative EPS impact from the reduction to our organic revenue growth outlook offset by $0.02 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments, $0.01 in favorability related to updated interest expense estimates and a positive $0.11 per share benefit from improvement in our outlook for our effective tax rate. Our updated effective tax rate estimate includes approximately 0.5% of full year rate benefit or approximately $0.06 per share from a non-recurring tax reserve release we expect in Q4 as a result of the lapsing of an applicable statute of limitation. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you Brian and good morning. IDEXX delivered against our strategic priorities in the third quarter including strong profit growth as we advanced a robust innovation agenda supported by a high touch commercial model. These pillars of our organic growth strategy position IDEXX to continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostics sector over the long-term while supporting solid organic revenue growth in the near-term. Third quarter CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by sustained IDEXX execution growth drivers including solid net new business gains, customer retention rates sustaining at over 97% and a net price realization aligned with our expectations including impacts from extens expansions in corporate accounts. Performance was also supported by double digit growth in our premium instrument installed base reflecting high interest by practices around the world in adopting IDEXX technology to obtain differential clinical insights. These consistent growth drivers reflect the benefits from our decades long strategic commitment to focusing and integrating on companion animal diagnostic assays instrumentation software supported by a highly capable and tenured commercial organization. As Brian noted, US Sector and IDEXX US growth has been moderated by cumulative macro pressures on pet owners which has pressured visit and demand trends in U.S. clinics. The results we are providing this morning reflect excellent execution from teams across IDEXX in a more challenged macro environment. We remain confident in the enduring positive secular growth tailwinds that create an attractive growth opportunity for our sector over time. From a growing global pet population to longer pet lifespans and increased opportunities to improve the quality of our pets lives, the future growth opportunity and the value of companion animal medical services remains highly compelling, further enabled by IDEXX innovations and commercial focus. These secular trends position companion animal diagnostics as the fastest growing area in the vet clinic and a key driver of medical services and practice profits. Today I'll review IDEXX'S progress against our strategic objectives and how strong commercial and operational execution helped deliver excellent financial performance in the quarter. Customers seek insights on both new existing diagnostic tests that support disease detection, interpretation and care management and ways to optimize clinic workflows to increase staff productivity. They rely on IDEXX commercial professionals who bring subject matter expertise and best practice benchmarks to help them achieve their practice objectives. The result is a sustained trend of diagnostics revenue growth outpacing overall clinic revenues as well as high levels of retention and sector leading levels of customer satisfaction. IDEXX commercial teams delivered solid third quarter global premium instrument placements across regions and platforms. Building on high prior year levels. These placements supported the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit premium instrument installed base growth on a worldwide basis as well as for our international regions. In the US the continued strong pace of competitive catalyst placements coupled with overall placements and including IDEXX inVue Dx preorders resulted in very strong year-on-year EVI gains highlighting the high quality of placements in the period and expected future consumable revenues. In Europe, continued strong net customer gains and premium installed base growth supported a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit CAG diagnostic for recurring revenue growth, highlighting the benefits from our maturing European sales organization. These are just a few examples of the growth and value our teams are delivering aided by a new wave of IDEXX innovation. Customer interest in partnering with IDEXX was also reflected in the three major corporate account relationship expansions secured this year. These extensions position IDEXX to benefit from volume gains as new business is brought into the extended agreements. These expanded relationships will benefit growth across our modalities over time. The extension and expansion of these key account agreements demonstrate IDEXX's ability to deliver value to customers of all types and sizes as these partnership models are increasingly centered on organically driven growth versus through clinic acquisition. In addition to serving strong demand for our current on market products, commercial execution also includes supporting demand for upcoming IDEXX innovations which is especially relevant now given the early stages of our new wave of innovation. As we sit here today, IDEXX is on the cusp of delivering the newest significant piece of innovation. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, which remains on target for a Q4 launch. Our commercial teams have been engaging with customers highlighting the benefits of this transformative new in clinic testing platform and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Since beginning to take orders in North America at the end Of July, the IDEXX commercial team has taken close to 700 inVue Dx pre orders in Q3. This demonstrates the high value that clinicians place on the new diagnostic insights they will receive as part of the launch menu with ear cytology and blood morphology in the easy use they attach to slide free workflow. Early customer enthusiasm for inVue Dx is very high as they see inVue as a transformative point of care platform. Additionally, we started to take preorders in select international geographies in Q4 as we build global demand and keep in mind the value of the IDEXX InView DX analyzer will expand beyond ear cytology and blood morphology over time. Designed as a technology for Life platform, the InView DX menu will expand in 2025 as we add F&A lumps and bumps capabilities. This menu expansion will help address the approximately 25 million dogs around the world that we estimate would benefit from an oncology diagnostics as part of a clinical visit. This opportunity highlights the reason that we focus on purpose-built platforms as an expanded menu over time grows both medical and economic value similar to our catalyst platform beyond InView DX. IDEXX's in clinic business also continues to benefit from innovation and in September we began shipping Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Lights to customers in North America with the global rollout beginning with Europe in Q4 and extending to other regions over 2025. The catalyst pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients suspected of pancreatitis, represents the 10 menu addition to the Catalyst platform since 2012. This most recent example of our technology for life innovation strategy delivers improved functionality and diagnostic insights to our customers, all while using IDEXX analyzers that have already been purchased and built clinical workflows around. This strategy not only increases the medical value of an IDEXX analyzer to our customers, enabling them to deliver improved standards of care, but also helps drive utilization and increases the economic value to IDEXX of a premium instrument placement. Early feedback from customers in North America has been extremely positive for this quantitative test. With over 3,000 customers already utilizing the slide for dogs and cats, this important diagnostics test will soon be available to our entire 72,000 plus catalyst installed bays globally. Also at the point of care, IDEXX Catalyst SmartQC launched recently in North America. It will be shortly followed by Global Romp. SmartQC greatly simplifies and streamlines the monthly Catalyst quality control process. Early indications estimate SmartQC is 90% faster than the existing process. This is yet another example of our focus on bringing innovations to our customers that enhance workflows and unlock critical capacity. IDEXX teams continue to advance work towards the 2025 launch of the IDEXX Cancer Diagnostic Screening Panel at IDEXX Reference Labs. Launching initially with lymphoma detection and 2025, the IDEXX Cancer DX Panel will expand over three years to cover the six most common cancers which represent greater than 50% of canine cancer cases and $1.1 billion addressable revenue opportunity. Extensive research has shown that both veterinarians and pet owners see value in the medical insights that come from oncology screening and are highly likely to adopt this new technology. We look forward to sharing more updates on these critical pieces of innovation as we get closer to launch. Complementary to our diagnostic solutions, IDEXX software solutions provide customers with robust, intuitive products that support greater diagnostics utilization while simplifying workflows at each stage of the pet owner visit, thereby helping customers unlock capacity for more value-added work. Veterinary clinics see tangible benefits from cloud-based software technologies and IDEXX meets these needs with our broad portfolio of cloud native products from practice management systems that are tailored to the practice size and needs to workflow management tools. The result of this fit between IDEXX software products and customer needs resulted in high double digit growth in cloud based product placements which once again comprised over 95% of total software placements. Momentum for software business remains very strong with quarterly placements growing sequentially through Q3, while future placements are supported by strong bookings and pipeline aided by increased commercial productivity and corporate account interest. These trends are a leading indicator for future DevSoft and diagnostic imaging. Recurring revenue growth as a growing PIMS installed base is the gateway for customers to benefit from our expanding vertical SaaS offerings. These include workflow and pet owner engagement tools, payment processing and other productivity enablers. We are pleased by the early interest in Velo, our modern Pet owner engagement application with deep integration into IDEXX PIMS. As a quarter end we had over 300 enrolled and active practices and excellent pet owner engagement is measured by higher clinical visits, clinical revenue and diagnostics usage post implementation based on a robust pipeline. We look forward to growing vel's clinic user base by more than double by year end. As we shared at Investor Day. We have an exciting development roadmap for Velo to further address practice pain points with pet owner communications while helping to further drive visit growth and diagnostics utilization. We look forward to providing updates as we advance our software strategy and grow the related high margin recurring revenues. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to recognize the IDEXX employees who are working hard to serve veterinarians and pets in areas impacted by Hurricane, Helene and Milton. Our lab operations team took proactive measures to protect employees, mitigate service disruptions, and provide critical diagnostic services to advance care for pets in needs. We stand ready to support our customers impacted by these hurricanes as they look to rebuild their practices and resume operations. Now let's please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much. This is Katerina on for Chris. Thank you for taking your question. So first, you touched upon this earlier in the prepared remarks, but can you maybe just elaborate a bit on the drivers of the reduction outlook and the step down in 4Q? I guess what's the rough split between the weather things you mentioned and the underlying US macro versus anything else want to call out? And then I guess second question is just on vet visits more broadly, can you just elaborate a bit on what's the biggest delta I guess between the underlying outlook you gave in 2Q versus the one you're giving now? I guess what's different in the market and what's driving this kind of worsening macro environment? And where are you expecting to see the most impact? Thank you so much.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your questions on Q4. Just to clarify the commentary, we highlighted an outlook for organic growth overall of about 3% and CAGDX recurring revenue growth of 3.5 to 4%. The 3.5% to 4% is net of a estimated 0.5% growth rate impact from the hurricane. So if you normalize for that it is 4% to 4.5% and that is actually aligned with our outlook for price benefit. So in Q4 we're basically looking at normalized for weather, relatively flat volume. It is similar to the trends that we saw coming out of Q3. It incorporates a similar outlook for clinical visits that we saw in Q3X the weather impact. There is some impact from weather and so it really is more reflecting the trends that we saw in the third quarter. I think the one element in the third quarter that was somewhat different than we anticipated, we saw relatively more kind of pressure on end clinic demand in terms of just independent of clinics, some compression on that. We tried to highlight in our comments that the for pets coming into the clinic frequency is sustaining. It's actually up in wellness. It's when you adjust for the pain med effect. It's. It's actually up in non-wellness as well. And so I think that is very encouraging that there's still a lot of interest in diagnostics for the pets coming in. It's not expanding like it had historically. I think that's probably our, an element that we're still working through. And again, we think that's more near-term macro impacts that will both on the visits front and in terms of some of these demand impacts we think we'll be able to work through over time. But in the near-term we're just incorporating these trends in our balance of your outlook.\nJay Mazelsky: Let me address your question about the clinical visit piece. As Brian indicated, we continue to attribute that to the near-term macro and sector pressures. Clearly from a macro standpoint there's the cumulative pressures of inflation and not just affecting animal health, but across the economy as a whole. We continue to see, that at the pet owner level there's a great deal of resilience. I think pet owners continue to prioritize the care for their pets at the, at the expense of other discretionary categories. But that's not to say that they're immune to these broader macro pressures, especially at the margin. we think that from an overall clinical visit standpoint it will normalize over time. all the, I think sector drivers around pet population growth, pet longevity, human pet bond, aging pets which will, consume more care are important, important support to the overall clinical visit trends. And then that our own innovation and the contribution that our own innovation will play both from a direct and leverage standpoint as, as we add capabilities to practices that support these long-term trends will drive the increase in utilization.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Riskin with Bank of America.\nMichael Riskin: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. First to start, the reference lap number came in particularly weak in the quarter. I think we were a little bit surprised. That was the biggest delta. And during your performance remarks you made some comments about how there was some impact to price in reference lab from those three major customer agreements. Could you expand on that a little bit? Is that, I mean, I think we kind of can read between the lines that there was a little bit of price to win the contract. Is that standard operating procedure? Were these a little bit more Outsized than normal, just in general. Is that something you're seeing a little bit more pushback on in terms of price or if there's anything else on Reference Lab to call out?\nBrian McKeon: Thanks, Mike. Maybe I could just set context on the numbers in the quarter and then allow Jay to talk about the dynamics. In reference Labs, we had 2.4% growth organically. We highlighted there was actually a day's headwind effect in labs. The benefit that we saw in the quarter was all related to shipping days. So normalized roughly 3% growth. And we highlighted that volume growth was actually positive. So to your point, there is a level of effect on lab price realization, which is a good news item in that we this year had three major new customer extensions and expansions and that will have long-term bond growth benefits for IDEXX. And you know that that's captured in kind of our gross to net pricing effect. And you see some of that in the Q3 numbers in labs. But the underlying health of the business is quite solid, particularly with some of the pressures we've seen on things like wellness testing. So Jay can expand on that?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, I think there's a couple ways of looking at this. The execution drivers at the Reference Lab business continue to be really strong. As Brian indicated, we have seen modest volume growth. There's new business gains and very high customer retention levels. The price gains were moderated by these major new customer agreements and expansions and extensions and they will benefit the company and the business over the longer term through volume grades. Keep in mind that the Reference Labs is relatively more indexed to wellness testing. We know that wellness testing has been more pressured. We saw the decline of 3.4% in the U.S. there hasn't been change in any of the mix that we've described over time. And we're very optimistic about the innovation agenda for the Reference Labs. We take Fecal antigen and Cystathin B for kidney health and the IDEXX cancer diagnostics in 2025. Really continue to position that modality in a highly differentiated way. And just getting back to my prior comment, clinical visits will normalize over time.\nMichael Riskin: Okay. And then if I can squeeze in the follow up, just want to expand more on price in general. You talked about five for the quarter. I think you're kind of sticking with 5 for the year. 5% price. 4Q is going to be a little bit lighter than that. Four, four and a half. I know some of that is probably tied to timing of the price increases you took last year. Again, correct me if I'm wrong. And if your 4Q price assumption did get lowered, but just in general, how do you think about price as a lever going forward? Jay, you just talked about thinking that vet visits will come back. We talk about execution and new product launches and sort of the IDEXX premium. The third pillar of the model is price. It's been obviously very elevated over the last three years. In '22, '23, '24, it looks like it's starting to normalize a little bit. Should we expect that to continue continued normalization of price over time back to that 2 to 3% historical level? Is that the right way to think about it?\nBrian McKeon: Yes. Mike, just to clarify some of the numbers that we shared, as you noted, we reinforced the 5% full year outlook. Some moderation in Q4. That's principally just the new business effects that we highlighted. So I think this is consistent kind of trends. We are positioned to communicate our pricing to our customers. It's not a lapping effect, is kind of the. I think that was part of your question. It's more the new business effect. And we're positioned to communicate our price increases for next year later this year with our customers. Continue to feel very good about the value that we're delivering with the focus on innovation and that we've had in the long-term as a company. And we have a new wave of innovation that we're really excited about. So I think it'll be anticipated, it'll be a positive driver for us in the near-term. In the longer term.\nJay Mazelsky: Keep in mind that the way we think about pricing is to really maintain. We want to maintain. We want to be on the right side of the whole value equation. And so there's obviously new products, new innovation, but then there's products that we continue to really expand from a feature and capability standpoint. So you think about Fecal imaging and Cystoisospora and tapes and Cystatin B and VEConnect plus these were all added to the menu and panels at no additional cost. So what we strive for is to really make sure that we're adding value and price obviously reflects that. And as Brian indicated, we'll provide more guidance when we provide 2025 guidance.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from John Block with Stifel. Thanks guys.\nJonathan Block: Good morning, Brian. The first one, I think there's a step down in the 24 guidance of about 150bps for total organic revenue versus the 100 bip step down for CAG the ex-recurring at the midpoint. So maybe if you can speak what that's attributable to in regards to the Delta, I'm guessing it might be fewer end use going out this year than maybe initially expected? Maybe a little bit of LPD as well. So we'd love your thoughts there. And then just to tack onto that any color on the realized ASP for in view as we start sort of scrubbing the model and the contribution into '25 and then I'll ask my follow up.\nBrian McKeon: Great, thanks. Thanks for your question. John. I think you hit on the themes. It's the Update includes incorporating Q3 so I think we did see somewhat softer results in areas like LPD than anticipated. So we're carrying that. I think we are capturing also the instrument revenue effects. It's principally just the strength of the in view advanced orders. I think that does have some impact in the overall order generation. So in terms of our other premium instruments, it's a good news story. Overall the EBI normalizes up very strongly and so we're really encouraged by that. And so those are kind of the factors, some tweaking on the software numbers as well just based on trends.So those are kind of the themes. The bigger driver of course is just the calibration on the CAG diagnostic recurring. Regarding your specific question on NV pricing, I think low teens has been the number we've shared and I think that's still a good estimate for the instrument price realization. It'll vary by program, but to the degree these are placed under things like 360 contracts, it's primarily upfront revenue.\nJonathan Block: Okay, got it. Helpful and maybe I'll ask the follow up there.But Jay, are there any comments of was the plan always to take 700 orders and only ship 50 out? You know obviously you're beta testing this in the field. Were there any challenges that you incurred throughout that process in terms of why most of those shipments are occurring? Call it in '25, '24. That's sort of the follow up. But then the second question just on the corporate renewals, you guys don't typically talk a lot about that but admittedly corporates are a big part of the market. I don't know 30 or 40%. So just any more color that you can provide? Was that just specific to the lab number, not the in clinic? And then for the lab Brian, did we think about it like the pricing will be a headwind for the next three quarters. It took effect third quarter of '24 it's a headwind for the next three quarters, year over year and then essentially you lap the pricing benefit but continue to. I'm sorry, you lapped the pricing headwind but continue to benefit from the volume tailwind for what I'm assuming is a multiyear contract and hopefully that came across okay. Thanks guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, let me start with the corporates and I'll address the in-view launch and I'll turn it to Brian for some additional color on that. from a corporate standpoint, we've been very successful and these represent not just extensions but expansions. I think the corporates from a maturity standpoint are focusing more on organic growth. If you go back, they grew through clinic acquisition and there was a lot of consolidation and arbitrage. And so I think that the focus on organic growth, not just within the reference labs but using technology, whether it's point of care software and integrating those pieces, has positioned us really well and has given us an opportunity to really partner with them and help them achieve those objectives. And as I indicated in my remarks, there are certainly volume benefits that we see over time that will develop as a result of expanded business with those folks. So yeah, very excited by that. There's also, I would say from a corporate standpoint, more of an emphasis on how to implement wellness campaigns and programs. Much more harmonized way versus independent clinics as one offs. From an in view launch standpoint, we have a very tried intrude approach in terms of how we launch instrumentation. If you look at Catalyst, inVue Dx and more recently Prosci one, we start in a control fashion. We're very careful that we deliver the right customer experience. Customers expect that from us and the way we do that is we start with a smaller group of implementations and onboard those customers and tweaks as necessary. So it's really not driven by a certain number in Q4. It's really more from overall readiness so that we deliver the right experience and build over time. The receptivity to that product itself has just been outstanding and we look forward to being able to build global demand based on the menu. Very compelling menu for customers.\nBrian McKeon: And John, to your specific question, I hope I could follow it, but the new business effects and pricing are relatively more in labs, US labs. So that's where some of the business opportunity that we're very excited about in terms of expanding the relationships is flowing from. And I think your point was about lapping and I think you're correct. There is a, there's kind of a gross to net kind of effect in the near-term, but you work through that. Keep in mind it was three agreements that kind of built through the year. So it'll be, we'll get more clarity as we get into 2025, but basically there'll be some favorable lapping dynamics that go on the latter half of next year. To your point, you nailed it.\nOperator: The next question is from an Aventee with BMP Paribas.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you discuss how industry innovation in the affordability space so with vet practices offering payment plans and ADEX credit card in view and Velo could help mitigating lower visits in the near and longer term. And also can you discuss the as you are monitoring the divergence between wellness and non-wellness visits, what are you updated thoughts on the sector conditions? Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Just maybe address the payment question first. Most of our instruments, whether it's in view or broader vet lab suites are placed through various programs and what that typically involves is there's not cash upfront and the customers make a volume, commitment over a period of time. So from a it's built in financing if you will. So there's not really, practice cash constraints on being able to, purchase new technology or instrumentation. our focus is really being able to provide technology and tools that help with capacity challenges as they exist. You know, the flip side of capacity is obviously productivity and practices are looking for ways that optimize workflow within the practice support staff productivity enable them to communicate with clients or pet owners and Velo helps us do that.\nBrian McKeon: And just your question on visit trends, it's interesting we tried to highlight this pain medication pain med visit effect in the numbers and as we noted that overall the -2 point visits are actually supported by about one to one and a half percent of benefit from these payment visits which show up in the non-wellness visit per the data analysis that we've done. And when you adjust for that, roughly the wellness visits would be down about 4% and non-wellness would be down about 3%. And so it's relatively more pressure on non-wellness exes pain med visits. But I would say it's indicative of a broader kind of challenge that we've had related to the macrodynamics which is visits are down overall. So I think again somewhat more in wellness which is logical given that it's relatively more discretionary but it's a broader theme.\nOperator: The next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. Good morning. Could you give us an update on cancer to. Yes, just the timeline magnitude that you're thinking there in terms of the rollout. And then just where should we think about in terms of. Or what should we think about in terms of price? As this is sort of a premium cancer screening wellness type of platform and any sort of early feedb on your kind of pilot testing or as you kind of talk to customers about the opportunity, particularly in the initial offering in canine lymphoma. Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Erin. We continue to work on really making nice progress on IDEXX cancer diagnostics with lymphoma. You know, we're still targeting a 2025 launch from both a price as well as tertiary time standpoint. We see it as a, an appropriate wellness screening, really being able to target younger but at risk dogs as well as older dogs. The feedback from key opinion leaders and oncologists has been excellent. So we continue to fully develop the product, validate the testing platforms, collect data, and are really looking forward to being able to build a market. We know that both pet owners and veterinarians see this as a major pain point today in terms of being able to detect cancer earlier than what's currently done. And when you can detect cancer earlier, obviously the therapeutic options you have are more numerous and more effective.\nErin Wright: Okay, thanks. And then just on the reference lab in general, I know you touched a little bit on it before, but in terms of kind of the performance in the quarter, how we should think about the quarterly progression, any sort of changes from a competitive landscape standpoint at all, and then also just kind of your strategy, whether it's turnaround times and service levels and overnight testing and that kind of stuff, is anything changed in terms of how you're kind of contracting or working with your customers on the reference laboratory side, particularly in just kind of an inherently lower volume environment. Thanks.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. Aaron, we don't see any change in the competitive dynamic. We track that very closely. We look at net new business gains which have been positive for the quarter and for the year. We look at retention levels which remain very high in the reference labs. As Brian indicated earlier, we do see volume growth in the reference labs, the differentiation around the overall menu, Fecal antigen and the whole renal health panels and vecnect plus in the coming IDEXX cancer diagnostics, we think continues to position us really well. I think the corporate contract extensions and expansions I talked to, I spoke about really speak to the differentiation of our reference lab business. Corporates as well as independent practices want to partner with us and putting together win win partnerships is part of our strategy.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair.\nBrandon Vasquez: Hey everyone, thanks for taking the question. I had two. They're both kind of related to kind of end market volumes. And so I'll maybe just ask them both upfront. The first one is, as part of your snapshot, you guys also disclose the frequency and utilization metrics. Maybe X price, if you look at that. Still a little depressed. I always tend to think of those as things that you have a little bit more control over versus the vet visit volumes. So maybe just talk about within frequency and utilization. What levers do you guys have that you can pull on as we go into 25 to help offset some of the weaker vet visit growth? And then the second follow up on vet visits is just around these pain medication headwinds that you guys are talking about. Can you clarify if this is simply, the headwind that you're talking about is simply looking at vet visit volumes, they're actually worse than they are. Or is the impact that less NSAIDs because now they're switching to injectables, means that less diagnostic tests are being done for pain medication? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: So maybe I can clarify the last point and it provides a little bit of data insight on your frequency and utilization question that Jay can expand on. But what we're seeing in the data is that there are a number of visits, particularly older pets, that are related to pain medication, more recently, particularly follow up visits where the pets are being brought in and there typically isn't a diagnostic, there's an administration of the pain medication. And that is with the ramp of these pain meds, particularly over the last few quarters, that's been a pretty meaningful positive contributor to visit growth, but obviously doesn't benefit our business in terms of driving diagnostics. So what we're trying to highlight is that minus 2% on clinical visits is really for our business, minus 3% to 3.5% in terms of visits that drive diagnostics. When you turn to their frequency in the utilization side, what's interesting is adjusting for those dynamics, frequency is actually up. So for visits for pets that are coming into the clinic, we think it's positive 50 basis points rather than the minus 50 basis points we show. And it actually we see increases in utilization as well per visit, albeit at moderated paces from what we've seen historically. But it's continuing to be positive. So that's kind of the backdrop. I think there is a specific dynamic as it relates to some of the metrics that our investors focus in on and we focus in on. We think the underlying dynamics within the clinic are very healthy. It's really a visit challenge for us. But Jay can talk more about this?\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So, the way we, from a strategic standpoint, influence both frequency and utilization is really through innovation and our commercial model. Innovation has both direct and leveraged impacts in terms of being able to drive testing, obviously within we begin shipping inVue, they'll use the cartridges and consumables and that drives utilization. But also, our programs, our marketing programs that place instruments through IDEXX360 really inspire use of the reference labs and rapid assay and our software businesses. So it's, we think that over time, and we've shown this over time that historically where do you bring innovations that solve the most challenging, both clinical and business problems that, customers end up, veterinarians end up using diagnostics because it's really foundational in terms of driving the medical services and care management approaches within their clinics.\nOperator: The next question is from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm going to unpack a couple of that on the reference lab and then on the pain drug visits. And ultimately what I'm trying to get to is potential utilization acceleration probably next year or maybe the year after. But the differential between consumables and reference lab, we haven't seen that big of a gap since 2018. Is there a way maybe veterinary groups are thinking about changing the way they're thinking about diagnostics, perhaps using inside lab more as a strategy to generate more diagnostics. And again, I'm only saying that because we're seeing the biggest gap that we've seen. You've explained some of that stuff, including days and then also on the pain drug. In fact, we've seen Cytopoint. It's been around since 2016. It's been about half as much of an impact on visits, but it's still been an impact on visits. Now elderly patients are more likely to be sold the diagnostics. So you would think that, maybe there's a, as you see this captive audience, I mean, when we talk to veterinary customers, they love this captive audience. So is there maybe a longer tail impact to increase diagnostics? Because now you have the elderly patient. And again, I'm trying to focus this question on utilization of diagnostics. Maybe next year as we build on some of these trends. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: Yeah. So good morning, David. Let me just talk about the in clinic versus the reference lab model, we don't see actually a modality shift. I think a number of things influence that. Obviously wellness visits, as I called out, is primarily a reference lab send out modality. But just in terms of overall use, it's based on situational conditions with the pet. If the pet comes in and is non well or an acute condition, veterinarians tend to do the in clinic testing so they get to interpretation quickly. In other cases, if it's a specialty test, they'll send that out. But we haven't seen, we actually haven't seen a mix shift above and beyond the wellness visit trend that may be impacted by overall macro considerations. In terms of the pain medication piece, the point that I would highlight is we haven't seen for those patients coming in to the practice that are getting let's say pain medication primarily, let's focus on dogs, primarily older dogs. And we haven't seen any impact on the use of diagnostics. So we don't think there's a substitution, effect or potentially even driving more diagnostics in those cases, if that's what you were getting at.\nBrian McKeon: And Dave, just to your question on utilization and utilization drivers over time, I know you're familiar with this, but we've highlighted frequently in our longer-term strategic discussions the metric of bloodwork inclusion in diagnostics and that for a very long period of time had accelerated at 50 basis points. We saw that going into the pandemic actually accelerated through the pandemic. And what we see more recently in this transition post pandemic period with some of the macro headwinds is it's sustaining, it's just not growing at the 50 basis points. That's a 200-basis point growth upside. If we can get back to the 50 basis point expansion for our US business and 150 basis points globally that was highlighted in our investor day discussion. So we're encouraged that it's sustaining so well with some of the macro dynamics going on and building off of the accelerated growth that we saw there in pandemic. And we feel very confident in our ability to influence that over time as we've done for decades and see that as central to our long-term growth strategy.\nJay Mazelsky: So I'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. It's once again my pleasure to share how I'd executed against our organic growth strategy. While delivering excellent financial results in the third quarter, companion animal diagnostics sector remains an attractive space supported by long-term global secular growth drivers and a significant opportunity to enhance standards of care. IDEXX's current innovation cycle and effective customer engagement playbook have positioned us well to lead the penetration of this opportunity, and I look forward to sharing more updates with you on our solid progress. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the third quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 6% organically supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 13% organic growth in our water business. Organic revenue gains were supported by benefits from IDEXX execution drivers reflected in consistent solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and double-digit growth in our premium instrument install base. While not reported in our quarterly results, IDEXX secured nearly 700 orders for our new In View Analyzer which supported strong growth in EVI metrics that will position the company to build on this momentum, partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was constrained by impacts from near-term US macro and sector headwinds. As we'll discuss, we're updating our full year organic revenue growth guidance to reflect expectations for continued near-term macro and sectoral pressure in the US and to incorporate estimated negative impacts from recent severe weather events. IDEXX continues to deliver strong profit performance as we work through these dynamics reflected in solid comparable operating margin gains in Q3, keeping us on track to achieve our full year operating margin goals. Solid revenue growth and operating margin gains supported EPS of $2.80 per share in Q3, up 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 6% was driven by 6% organic revenue gains in our CAG business and 13% organic growth in water; partially offset by 2% organic declines in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 6% organic gains in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue decreased 9% organically reflecting comparisons to record prior year placement levels and near-term impacts from our commercial focus on IDEXX in view order generation, which will primarily benefit 2025 reported instrument revenues worldwide. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. This includes approximately 1% of global equivalent day growth benefit in the quarter related to increased shipping days in our in-Clinic Business. Q3 CAG Diagnostic Recurring revenue growth was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 5% with US. net price realization of approximately 4%. US net price realization includes impacts from the successful extension and expansion of three major customer agreements in 2024. These agreements will provide long-term incremental volume growth benefits for IDEXX as we expand our business relationships with these customers. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the third quarter was supported by 10% international organic gains. International growth reflected benefits from net price realization, continued solid volume gains and approximately 0.5% of positive equivalent days effects. International growth was driven by IDEXX execution reflected in continued strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of a global premium instrument install base. US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 5% in Q3 including approximately 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. US growth was supported by continued solid positive growth contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX's US growth expanded at a solid premium to comparable US same store clinical visit growth levels. In the US. we continue to work through macro and sector dynamics which contributed to a 2.1% decline in same store clinical visit growth in Q3, including a relatively higher 3.4% same store decline and more discretionary wellness visits. Overall US clinical visit growth levels include an estimated 1% to 1.5% growth benefit from the ramping of pain medication visits over the last year, which typically do not include diagnostics. This is added to the near-term clinical visit headwind effect for IDEXX's US CAG business. For pets visiting US clinics, pet owners continue to demonstrate interest in a higher standard of care despite macro pressures. If we adjust US Sector metrics for the estimated pain medication impact on clinical visits and diagnostic frequency, we continue to see an increase in the percentage of visits that include at least one diagnostic. Over the last 12 months, the percentage of clinical visits with core blood work inclusion has also sustained at elevated levels following the accelerated expansion seen during the pandemic. These trends reinforce that the primary headwind to IDEXX's growth in the near-term remains pressure on clinical visit growth. Given recent trends and our updated full year organic growth outlook, we factored in expectations for continued near-term constraints on CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth from US macro and sector impacts. IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic growth and strong financial performance as we work through these near-term headwinds. We're highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation as we continue to execute towards our business strategy aligned with raising standards of pet healthcare globally. In terms of growth by modality, third quarter results were supported by strong global gains in consumable revenues. At IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically reflecting double digit gains in the US and international regions including benefits from increased equivalent shipping days effects. Consumable gains were supported by 10% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We achieved 4,128 CAG global premium instrument replacements in Q3, a decrease of 443 units or approximately 10% compared to record prior year levels, while securing 691 orders for our new IDEXX in view analyzer in North America. We're on track for initiation of shipments of in view in Q4 with expectations for approximately 50 to 100 shipments this year with the bulk of the advance orders targeted for delivery in 2025. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 6% organically in the third quarter reflecting solid global gains including benefits from net price realization and positive equivalent shipping Days effects. Global lab revenues increased 2% organically in Q3 net of a modest equivalent days headwind reflecting low single digit gains in the US and solid growth in international regions. Reference Lab results adjusted for days effects were supported by modest volume growth aided by new business gains which offset pressures related to macro and sector conditions constraining same store sales levels. Net price gains in our Reference Lab line of business in Q3 were moderated by impacts from major new customer agreements which will benefit long-term. Reference Lab Growth Veterinary Software services and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 11% as reported including benefits from our recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 6% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software solutions. Water revenues increased 13% organically in Q3 supported by double digit gains in the US and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 2% organically as strong gains in the US were offset by lower Asia swine testing and herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.1% of 140 basis points on a comparable basis gross margin gains reflect favorable business mix including benefits from high growth and consumable revenues, lower instrument costs and favorable impacts from growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues. Operating expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis and 8% on a comparable basis. OpEx growth was driven by increases in sales and marketing expense and RD spending aligned with advancing our growth and innovation agenda. Operating margins were 31.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points year-on-year as reported and 100 basis points on a comparable basis. EPS was $2.80 per share in Q3, an increase of 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange increased revenue and operating profit by approximately $1 million and EPS by approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter net of a $1 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $192 million in Q3. On a trailing twelve-month basis. Our net income to free cash to a conversion ratio was 91%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% while updating our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $160 million, reflecting lower projected spend and project timing. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. In the third quarter, we allocated 225 million in capital to share repurchases, supporting a 1.1% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year overall organic revenue growth outlook to 5.3% to 6% and our outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to 5.8% to 6.4%. At midpoint, this reflects a reduction of 1% to 1.5% compared to our prior full year organic revenue growth outlook, primarily driven by recent US Macro and sector trends, constraining visits and demand at the clinic level. This outlook incorporates Q3 results and reflects expectations for continued pressure on US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4 related to macro and sector trends and recent severe weather impacts in Q4 at midpoint. The updated outlook reflects expectations for overall organic revenue growth of approximately 3%. This aligns with a Q4 midpoint expectation for global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% net of an estimated 0.5% of negative effect from severe weather impacts in the US. We expect global net price improvement and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues of approximately 4% to 4.5% in Q4, including effects from new business agreements. With a consistent outlook for approximately 5% full year global net price realization. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.865 billion to $3.890 billion, a reduction of $38 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent FX estimates. In terms of our profit guidance, our outlook for 28.7% to 29% in reported operating margins reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement. Our full year reported margin outlook incorporates effects from the discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in Q2, which will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. Excluding this impact and FX effects at midpoint, our operating margin outlook reflects a consistent 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year eps outlook of $10.37 to $10.53 per share is consistent with our prior EPS guidance at midpoint. At midpoint we've incorporated approximately $0.14 and negative EPS impact from the reduction to our organic revenue growth outlook offset by $0.02 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments, $0.01 in favorability related to updated interest expense estimates and a positive $0.11 per share benefit from improvement in our outlook for our effective tax rate. Our updated effective tax rate estimate includes approximately 0.5% of full year rate benefit or approximately $0.06 per share from a non-recurring tax reserve release we expect in Q4 as a result of the lapsing of an applicable statute of limitation. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your questions on Q4. Just to clarify the commentary, we highlighted an outlook for organic growth overall of about 3% and CAGDX recurring revenue growth of 3.5 to 4%. The 3.5% to 4% is net of a estimated 0.5% growth rate impact from the hurricane. So if you normalize for that it is 4% to 4.5% and that is actually aligned with our outlook for price benefit. So in Q4 we're basically looking at normalized for weather, relatively flat volume. It is similar to the trends that we saw coming out of Q3. It incorporates a similar outlook for clinical visits that we saw in Q3X the weather impact. There is some impact from weather and so it really is more reflecting the trends that we saw in the third quarter. I think the one element in the third quarter that was somewhat different than we anticipated, we saw relatively more kind of pressure on end clinic demand in terms of just independent of clinics, some compression on that. We tried to highlight in our comments that the for pets coming into the clinic frequency is sustaining. It's actually up in wellness. It's when you adjust for the pain med effect. It's. It's actually up in non-wellness as well. And so I think that is very encouraging that there's still a lot of interest in diagnostics for the pets coming in. It's not expanding like it had historically. I think that's probably our, an element that we're still working through. And again, we think that's more near-term macro impacts that will both on the visits front and in terms of some of these demand impacts we think we'll be able to work through over time. But in the near-term we're just incorporating these trends in our balance of your outlook. Thanks, Mike. Maybe I could just set context on the numbers in the quarter and then allow Jay to talk about the dynamics. In reference Labs, we had 2.4% growth organically. We highlighted there was actually a day's headwind effect in labs. The benefit that we saw in the quarter was all related to shipping days. So normalized roughly 3% growth. And we highlighted that volume growth was actually positive. So to your point, there is a level of effect on lab price realization, which is a good news item in that we this year had three major new customer extensions and expansions and that will have long-term bond growth benefits for IDEXX. And you know that that's captured in kind of our gross to net pricing effect. And you see some of that in the Q3 numbers in labs. But the underlying health of the business is quite solid, particularly with some of the pressures we've seen on things like wellness testing. So Jay can expand on that? Yes. Mike, just to clarify some of the numbers that we shared, as you noted, we reinforced the 5% full year outlook. Some moderation in Q4. That's principally just the new business effects that we highlighted. So I think this is consistent kind of trends. We are positioned to communicate our pricing to our customers. It's not a lapping effect, is kind of the. I think that was part of your question. It's more the new business effect. And we're positioned to communicate our price increases for next year later this year with our customers. Continue to feel very good about the value that we're delivering with the focus on innovation and that we've had in the long-term as a company. And we have a new wave of innovation that we're really excited about. So I think it'll be anticipated, it'll be a positive driver for us in the near-term. In the longer term. Great, thanks. Thanks for your question. John. I think you hit on the themes. It's the Update includes incorporating Q3 so I think we did see somewhat softer results in areas like LPD than anticipated. So we're carrying that. I think we are capturing also the instrument revenue effects. It's principally just the strength of the in view advanced orders. I think that does have some impact in the overall order generation. So in terms of our other premium instruments, it's a good news story. Overall the EBI normalizes up very strongly and so we're really encouraged by that. And so those are kind of the factors, some tweaking on the software numbers as well just based on trends.So those are kind of the themes. The bigger driver of course is just the calibration on the CAG diagnostic recurring. Regarding your specific question on NV pricing, I think low teens has been the number we've shared and I think that's still a good estimate for the instrument price realization. It'll vary by program, but to the degree these are placed under things like 360 contracts, it's primarily upfront revenue. And John, to your specific question, I hope I could follow it, but the new business effects and pricing are relatively more in labs, US labs. So that's where some of the business opportunity that we're very excited about in terms of expanding the relationships is flowing from. And I think your point was about lapping and I think you're correct. There is a, there's kind of a gross to net kind of effect in the near-term, but you work through that. Keep in mind it was three agreements that kind of built through the year. So it'll be, we'll get more clarity as we get into 2025, but basically there'll be some favorable lapping dynamics that go on the latter half of next year. To your point, you nailed it. And just your question on visit trends, it's interesting we tried to highlight this pain medication pain med visit effect in the numbers and as we noted that overall the -2 point visits are actually supported by about one to one and a half percent of benefit from these payment visits which show up in the non-wellness visit per the data analysis that we've done. And when you adjust for that, roughly the wellness visits would be down about 4% and non-wellness would be down about 3%. And so it's relatively more pressure on non-wellness exes pain med visits. But I would say it's indicative of a broader kind of challenge that we've had related to the macrodynamics which is visits are down overall. So I think again somewhat more in wellness which is logical given that it's relatively more discretionary but it's a broader theme. So maybe I can clarify the last point and it provides a little bit of data insight on your frequency and utilization question that Jay can expand on. But what we're seeing in the data is that there are a number of visits, particularly older pets, that are related to pain medication, more recently, particularly follow up visits where the pets are being brought in and there typically isn't a diagnostic, there's an administration of the pain medication. And that is with the ramp of these pain meds, particularly over the last few quarters, that's been a pretty meaningful positive contributor to visit growth, but obviously doesn't benefit our business in terms of driving diagnostics. So what we're trying to highlight is that minus 2% on clinical visits is really for our business, minus 3% to 3.5% in terms of visits that drive diagnostics. When you turn to their frequency in the utilization side, what's interesting is adjusting for those dynamics, frequency is actually up. So for visits for pets that are coming into the clinic, we think it's positive 50 basis points rather than the minus 50 basis points we show. And it actually we see increases in utilization as well per visit, albeit at moderated paces from what we've seen historically. But it's continuing to be positive. So that's kind of the backdrop. I think there is a specific dynamic as it relates to some of the metrics that our investors focus in on and we focus in on. We think the underlying dynamics within the clinic are very healthy. It's really a visit challenge for us. But Jay can talk more about this? And Dave, just to your question on utilization and utilization drivers over time, I know you're familiar with this, but we've highlighted frequently in our longer-term strategic discussions the metric of bloodwork inclusion in diagnostics and that for a very long period of time had accelerated at 50 basis points. We saw that going into the pandemic actually accelerated through the pandemic. And what we see more recently in this transition post pandemic period with some of the macro headwinds is it's sustaining, it's just not growing at the 50 basis points. That's a 200-basis point growth upside. If we can get back to the 50 basis point expansion for our US business and 150 basis points globally that was highlighted in our investor day discussion. So we're encouraged that it's sustaining so well with some of the macro dynamics going on and building off of the accelerated growth that we saw there in pandemic. And we feel very confident in our ability to influence that over time as we've done for decades and see that as central to our long-term growth strategy."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you Brian and good morning. IDEXX delivered against our strategic priorities in the third quarter including strong profit growth as we advanced a robust innovation agenda supported by a high touch commercial model. These pillars of our organic growth strategy position IDEXX to continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostics sector over the long-term while supporting solid organic revenue growth in the near-term. Third quarter CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by sustained IDEXX execution growth drivers including solid net new business gains, customer retention rates sustaining at over 97% and a net price realization aligned with our expectations including impacts from extens expansions in corporate accounts. Performance was also supported by double digit growth in our premium instrument installed base reflecting high interest by practices around the world in adopting IDEXX technology to obtain differential clinical insights. These consistent growth drivers reflect the benefits from our decades long strategic commitment to focusing and integrating on companion animal diagnostic assays instrumentation software supported by a highly capable and tenured commercial organization. As Brian noted, US Sector and IDEXX US growth has been moderated by cumulative macro pressures on pet owners which has pressured visit and demand trends in U.S. clinics. The results we are providing this morning reflect excellent execution from teams across IDEXX in a more challenged macro environment. We remain confident in the enduring positive secular growth tailwinds that create an attractive growth opportunity for our sector over time. From a growing global pet population to longer pet lifespans and increased opportunities to improve the quality of our pets lives, the future growth opportunity and the value of companion animal medical services remains highly compelling, further enabled by IDEXX innovations and commercial focus. These secular trends position companion animal diagnostics as the fastest growing area in the vet clinic and a key driver of medical services and practice profits. Today I'll review IDEXX'S progress against our strategic objectives and how strong commercial and operational execution helped deliver excellent financial performance in the quarter. Customers seek insights on both new existing diagnostic tests that support disease detection, interpretation and care management and ways to optimize clinic workflows to increase staff productivity. They rely on IDEXX commercial professionals who bring subject matter expertise and best practice benchmarks to help them achieve their practice objectives. The result is a sustained trend of diagnostics revenue growth outpacing overall clinic revenues as well as high levels of retention and sector leading levels of customer satisfaction. IDEXX commercial teams delivered solid third quarter global premium instrument placements across regions and platforms. Building on high prior year levels. These placements supported the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit premium instrument installed base growth on a worldwide basis as well as for our international regions. In the US the continued strong pace of competitive catalyst placements coupled with overall placements and including IDEXX inVue Dx preorders resulted in very strong year-on-year EVI gains highlighting the high quality of placements in the period and expected future consumable revenues. In Europe, continued strong net customer gains and premium installed base growth supported a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit CAG diagnostic for recurring revenue growth, highlighting the benefits from our maturing European sales organization. These are just a few examples of the growth and value our teams are delivering aided by a new wave of IDEXX innovation. Customer interest in partnering with IDEXX was also reflected in the three major corporate account relationship expansions secured this year. These extensions position IDEXX to benefit from volume gains as new business is brought into the extended agreements. These expanded relationships will benefit growth across our modalities over time. The extension and expansion of these key account agreements demonstrate IDEXX's ability to deliver value to customers of all types and sizes as these partnership models are increasingly centered on organically driven growth versus through clinic acquisition. In addition to serving strong demand for our current on market products, commercial execution also includes supporting demand for upcoming IDEXX innovations which is especially relevant now given the early stages of our new wave of innovation. As we sit here today, IDEXX is on the cusp of delivering the newest significant piece of innovation. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, which remains on target for a Q4 launch. Our commercial teams have been engaging with customers highlighting the benefits of this transformative new in clinic testing platform and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Since beginning to take orders in North America at the end Of July, the IDEXX commercial team has taken close to 700 inVue Dx pre orders in Q3. This demonstrates the high value that clinicians place on the new diagnostic insights they will receive as part of the launch menu with ear cytology and blood morphology in the easy use they attach to slide free workflow. Early customer enthusiasm for inVue Dx is very high as they see inVue as a transformative point of care platform. Additionally, we started to take preorders in select international geographies in Q4 as we build global demand and keep in mind the value of the IDEXX InView DX analyzer will expand beyond ear cytology and blood morphology over time. Designed as a technology for Life platform, the InView DX menu will expand in 2025 as we add F&A lumps and bumps capabilities. This menu expansion will help address the approximately 25 million dogs around the world that we estimate would benefit from an oncology diagnostics as part of a clinical visit. This opportunity highlights the reason that we focus on purpose-built platforms as an expanded menu over time grows both medical and economic value similar to our catalyst platform beyond InView DX. IDEXX's in clinic business also continues to benefit from innovation and in September we began shipping Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Lights to customers in North America with the global rollout beginning with Europe in Q4 and extending to other regions over 2025. The catalyst pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients suspected of pancreatitis, represents the 10 menu addition to the Catalyst platform since 2012. This most recent example of our technology for life innovation strategy delivers improved functionality and diagnostic insights to our customers, all while using IDEXX analyzers that have already been purchased and built clinical workflows around. This strategy not only increases the medical value of an IDEXX analyzer to our customers, enabling them to deliver improved standards of care, but also helps drive utilization and increases the economic value to IDEXX of a premium instrument placement. Early feedback from customers in North America has been extremely positive for this quantitative test. With over 3,000 customers already utilizing the slide for dogs and cats, this important diagnostics test will soon be available to our entire 72,000 plus catalyst installed bays globally. Also at the point of care, IDEXX Catalyst SmartQC launched recently in North America. It will be shortly followed by Global Romp. SmartQC greatly simplifies and streamlines the monthly Catalyst quality control process. Early indications estimate SmartQC is 90% faster than the existing process. This is yet another example of our focus on bringing innovations to our customers that enhance workflows and unlock critical capacity. IDEXX teams continue to advance work towards the 2025 launch of the IDEXX Cancer Diagnostic Screening Panel at IDEXX Reference Labs. Launching initially with lymphoma detection and 2025, the IDEXX Cancer DX Panel will expand over three years to cover the six most common cancers which represent greater than 50% of canine cancer cases and $1.1 billion addressable revenue opportunity. Extensive research has shown that both veterinarians and pet owners see value in the medical insights that come from oncology screening and are highly likely to adopt this new technology. We look forward to sharing more updates on these critical pieces of innovation as we get closer to launch. Complementary to our diagnostic solutions, IDEXX software solutions provide customers with robust, intuitive products that support greater diagnostics utilization while simplifying workflows at each stage of the pet owner visit, thereby helping customers unlock capacity for more value-added work. Veterinary clinics see tangible benefits from cloud-based software technologies and IDEXX meets these needs with our broad portfolio of cloud native products from practice management systems that are tailored to the practice size and needs to workflow management tools. The result of this fit between IDEXX software products and customer needs resulted in high double digit growth in cloud based product placements which once again comprised over 95% of total software placements. Momentum for software business remains very strong with quarterly placements growing sequentially through Q3, while future placements are supported by strong bookings and pipeline aided by increased commercial productivity and corporate account interest. These trends are a leading indicator for future DevSoft and diagnostic imaging. Recurring revenue growth as a growing PIMS installed base is the gateway for customers to benefit from our expanding vertical SaaS offerings. These include workflow and pet owner engagement tools, payment processing and other productivity enablers. We are pleased by the early interest in Velo, our modern Pet owner engagement application with deep integration into IDEXX PIMS. As a quarter end we had over 300 enrolled and active practices and excellent pet owner engagement is measured by higher clinical visits, clinical revenue and diagnostics usage post implementation based on a robust pipeline. We look forward to growing vel's clinic user base by more than double by year end. As we shared at Investor Day. We have an exciting development roadmap for Velo to further address practice pain points with pet owner communications while helping to further drive visit growth and diagnostics utilization. We look forward to providing updates as we advance our software strategy and grow the related high margin recurring revenues. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to recognize the IDEXX employees who are working hard to serve veterinarians and pets in areas impacted by Hurricane, Helene and Milton. Our lab operations team took proactive measures to protect employees, mitigate service disruptions, and provide critical diagnostic services to advance care for pets in needs. We stand ready to support our customers impacted by these hurricanes as they look to rebuild their practices and resume operations. Now let's please open the line for Q&A. Let me address your question about the clinical visit piece. As Brian indicated, we continue to attribute that to the near-term macro and sector pressures. Clearly from a macro standpoint there's the cumulative pressures of inflation and not just affecting animal health, but across the economy as a whole. We continue to see, that at the pet owner level there's a great deal of resilience. I think pet owners continue to prioritize the care for their pets at the, at the expense of other discretionary categories. But that's not to say that they're immune to these broader macro pressures, especially at the margin. we think that from an overall clinical visit standpoint it will normalize over time. all the, I think sector drivers around pet population growth, pet longevity, human pet bond, aging pets which will, consume more care are important, important support to the overall clinical visit trends. And then that our own innovation and the contribution that our own innovation will play both from a direct and leverage standpoint as, as we add capabilities to practices that support these long-term trends will drive the increase in utilization. Yeah, I think there's a couple ways of looking at this. The execution drivers at the Reference Lab business continue to be really strong. As Brian indicated, we have seen modest volume growth. There's new business gains and very high customer retention levels. The price gains were moderated by these major new customer agreements and expansions and extensions and they will benefit the company and the business over the longer term through volume grades. Keep in mind that the Reference Labs is relatively more indexed to wellness testing. We know that wellness testing has been more pressured. We saw the decline of 3.4% in the U.S. there hasn't been change in any of the mix that we've described over time. And we're very optimistic about the innovation agenda for the Reference Labs. We take Fecal antigen and Cystathin B for kidney health and the IDEXX cancer diagnostics in 2025. Really continue to position that modality in a highly differentiated way. And just getting back to my prior comment, clinical visits will normalize over time. Keep in mind that the way we think about pricing is to really maintain. We want to maintain. We want to be on the right side of the whole value equation. And so there's obviously new products, new innovation, but then there's products that we continue to really expand from a feature and capability standpoint. So you think about Fecal imaging and Cystoisospora and tapes and Cystatin B and VEConnect plus these were all added to the menu and panels at no additional cost. So what we strive for is to really make sure that we're adding value and price obviously reflects that. And as Brian indicated, we'll provide more guidance when we provide 2025 guidance. Yeah, let me start with the corporates and I'll address the in-view launch and I'll turn it to Brian for some additional color on that. from a corporate standpoint, we've been very successful and these represent not just extensions but expansions. I think the corporates from a maturity standpoint are focusing more on organic growth. If you go back, they grew through clinic acquisition and there was a lot of consolidation and arbitrage. And so I think that the focus on organic growth, not just within the reference labs but using technology, whether it's point of care software and integrating those pieces, has positioned us really well and has given us an opportunity to really partner with them and help them achieve those objectives. And as I indicated in my remarks, there are certainly volume benefits that we see over time that will develop as a result of expanded business with those folks. So yeah, very excited by that. There's also, I would say from a corporate standpoint, more of an emphasis on how to implement wellness campaigns and programs. Much more harmonized way versus independent clinics as one offs. From an in view launch standpoint, we have a very tried intrude approach in terms of how we launch instrumentation. If you look at Catalyst, inVue Dx and more recently Prosci one, we start in a control fashion. We're very careful that we deliver the right customer experience. Customers expect that from us and the way we do that is we start with a smaller group of implementations and onboard those customers and tweaks as necessary. So it's really not driven by a certain number in Q4. It's really more from overall readiness so that we deliver the right experience and build over time. The receptivity to that product itself has just been outstanding and we look forward to being able to build global demand based on the menu. Very compelling menu for customers. Just maybe address the payment question first. Most of our instruments, whether it's in view or broader vet lab suites are placed through various programs and what that typically involves is there's not cash upfront and the customers make a volume, commitment over a period of time. So from a it's built in financing if you will. So there's not really, practice cash constraints on being able to, purchase new technology or instrumentation. our focus is really being able to provide technology and tools that help with capacity challenges as they exist. You know, the flip side of capacity is obviously productivity and practices are looking for ways that optimize workflow within the practice support staff productivity enable them to communicate with clients or pet owners and Velo helps us do that. Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Erin. We continue to work on really making nice progress on IDEXX cancer diagnostics with lymphoma. You know, we're still targeting a 2025 launch from both a price as well as tertiary time standpoint. We see it as a, an appropriate wellness screening, really being able to target younger but at risk dogs as well as older dogs. The feedback from key opinion leaders and oncologists has been excellent. So we continue to fully develop the product, validate the testing platforms, collect data, and are really looking forward to being able to build a market. We know that both pet owners and veterinarians see this as a major pain point today in terms of being able to detect cancer earlier than what's currently done. And when you can detect cancer earlier, obviously the therapeutic options you have are more numerous and more effective. Yeah. Aaron, we don't see any change in the competitive dynamic. We track that very closely. We look at net new business gains which have been positive for the quarter and for the year. We look at retention levels which remain very high in the reference labs. As Brian indicated earlier, we do see volume growth in the reference labs, the differentiation around the overall menu, Fecal antigen and the whole renal health panels and vecnect plus in the coming IDEXX cancer diagnostics, we think continues to position us really well. I think the corporate contract extensions and expansions I talked to, I spoke about really speak to the differentiation of our reference lab business. Corporates as well as independent practices want to partner with us and putting together win win partnerships is part of our strategy. Yeah. So, the way we, from a strategic standpoint, influence both frequency and utilization is really through innovation and our commercial model. Innovation has both direct and leveraged impacts in terms of being able to drive testing, obviously within we begin shipping inVue, they'll use the cartridges and consumables and that drives utilization. But also, our programs, our marketing programs that place instruments through IDEXX360 really inspire use of the reference labs and rapid assay and our software businesses. So it's, we think that over time, and we've shown this over time that historically where do you bring innovations that solve the most challenging, both clinical and business problems that, customers end up, veterinarians end up using diagnostics because it's really foundational in terms of driving the medical services and care management approaches within their clinics. Yeah. So good morning, David. Let me just talk about the in clinic versus the reference lab model, we don't see actually a modality shift. I think a number of things influence that. Obviously wellness visits, as I called out, is primarily a reference lab send out modality. But just in terms of overall use, it's based on situational conditions with the pet. If the pet comes in and is non well or an acute condition, veterinarians tend to do the in clinic testing so they get to interpretation quickly. In other cases, if it's a specialty test, they'll send that out. But we haven't seen, we actually haven't seen a mix shift above and beyond the wellness visit trend that may be impacted by overall macro considerations. In terms of the pain medication piece, the point that I would highlight is we haven't seen for those patients coming in to the practice that are getting let's say pain medication primarily, let's focus on dogs, primarily older dogs. And we haven't seen any impact on the use of diagnostics. So we don't think there's a substitution, effect or potentially even driving more diagnostics in those cases, if that's what you were getting at. So I'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. It's once again my pleasure to share how I'd executed against our organic growth strategy. While delivering excellent financial results in the third quarter, companion animal diagnostics sector remains an attractive space supported by long-term global secular growth drivers and a significant opportunity to enhance standards of care. IDEXX's current innovation cycle and effective customer engagement playbook have positioned us well to lead the penetration of this opportunity, and I look forward to sharing more updates with you on our solid progress. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\nBrian McKeon: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 10% organic gains in our water business. Solid CAG revenue growth was driven by global benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, reflected in sustained solid new business gains, record second quarter premium instrument placements and double-digit growth in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. Partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was constrained by impacts from near-term macro and sector headwinds, which contributed to a 2% decline in U.S. same store clinical visit growth levels in the quarter. IDEXX's operating performance reflected in solid comparable operating profit gains, continued to be strong in Q2. EPS in the quarter was $2.44, down 9% as reported, including a $0.56 per share impact from a $62 million discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Comparable EPS growth was 15% in the quarter, ahead of our expectations supported by solid gross margin gains and benefits from lower net interest costs and shares outstanding. IDEXX continues to make progress expanding our business, advancing our innovation agenda and delivering strong comparable profit gains as we work through near-term macro and sector headwinds that continue to pressure clinic visit levels. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends, which we estimate at midpoint will constrain overall organic revenue growth to the lower end of our original organic growth guidance for 2024. Our updated P&L guidance maintains our outlook for solid, comparable operating margin gains this year, and incorporates favorable adjustments for updated foreign exchange, net interest expense, and effective tax rate estimates. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 7% reflected 7% organic CAG gains, 10% organic growth in water and improved 3% organic growth in our LPD business. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic gains in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 12% organic growth and recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 5% organically building on high prior replacement levels. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q2 supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 5.5% with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by 10% international organic gains including approximately 1% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects in international regions. Strong international growth reflects benefits from net price realization and continued solid volume gains. International growth continues to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument install base. U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 5.2% in Q2, net of a 0.5% U.S. equivalent day growth headwind in the quarter. IDEXX growth was supported by solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels, and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX growth continues to expand at a high premium to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels which declined 1.8% in Q2. In the U.S., diagnostic utilization per clinical visit continues to expand solidly at the clinic level. This is reflected in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in diagnostic revenue dollars per clinical visit including diagnostics. While diagnostic frequency per clinical visit declined modestly in Q2, diagnostic frequency per wellness visit expanded 100 basis points. This partially offset lower diagnostic frequency per non-wellness visit. The decline in diagnostic frequency for non-wellness visits may reflect recent growth in fall clinical visits for pain management drug treatment which may not include diagnostics. Adjusting for these effects would imply relatively softer comparable U.S. clinical visit trends and a relatively higher IDEXX growth premium. Overall, IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic revenue growth in CAG diagnostic revenues as we work through headwinds from broader cumulative macro impacts on consumers which are likely pressuring near-term U.S. clinical visit growth levels. While we remain highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation, we factored in expectations for continued pressure from lower U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2024 and our updated full-year organic growth outlook. IDEXX execution drivers supported solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q2. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically reflecting solid gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology and SediVue outcomes. We achieved the Q2 record 4,952 CAG premium instrument placements, an increase of 4% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. These results were supported by continued strong growth and Premium Hematology and SediVue placements. ProCyte One momentum continues with the ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 17,000 instruments. Global Catalyst placement decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels in placement mix in international regions. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 6% organically in Q2, driven by solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues also increased 6% organically, reflecting solid U.S. gains and high single-digit growth in international regions. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 12% as reported including benefits from a recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 8% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 12% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud based software placements. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues increased 3% organically. Continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe offset lower Asia-Pacific revenues, including impacts from reduced swine testing in China and lower herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter, as reported, and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.7%, up 90 basis points on the comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflect benefits from net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts. Software service margin gains and favorable business mix. On a reported basis operating expenses increased 28% year-on-year, including 22% of growth impact related to the $62 million discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in G&A. Excluding this impact, Q2 OpEx growth was in line with overall revenue growth, driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. On a reported basis, operating margins were 26.3% in the quarter, including a 610 basis point impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. On a comparable basis, excluding this impact, operating margins increased approximately 110 basis points year-on-year. EPS was $2.44 per share in the quarter, a decrease of 9% as reported, including the $0.56 per share impact related to the discrete litigation expense accrual. EPS increased 15% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced revenues by approximately $7 million, operating profit by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter, net of a $2 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $215 million in Q2. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 99%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively. We allocated $208 million in capital to share repurchases in the second quarter, supporting a 0.7% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year organic growth outlook to reflect expectations for continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit trends in the second half of 2024. Our P&L outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid, comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for foreign exchange impacts, net interest expense, and our effective tax rate. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,885 million to $3,945 million, a reduction of $15 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent foreign exchange estimates. We've updated our full year guidance for overall organic revenue growth and CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth to 6.2% to 7.8%, or approximately 7%, at midpoint. Our outlook for overall organic revenue growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostics reporting revenue gains supported by IDEXX execution. This includes consistent expectations for full year global net price improvement of approximately 5%. Our updated organic growth outlook at midpoint assumes IDEXX execution growth benefits will be partially offset by continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit levels in the second half of this year similar to first half trends. We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results will benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects reflecting 1% to 1.5% organic growth rate benefits in Q3. In terms of our profit guidance, our updated outlook incorporates impacts from the discrete litigation expense accrual, which we estimate will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. We will normalize for the effects of this accrual in setting our 2025 financial performance goals. Incorporating these impacts, our updated reported operating margin outlook is 28.7% to 29.0%. This reflects a consistent 40 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins at midpoint net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.31 to $10.59 per share is down $0.56 per share at midpoint, reflecting the impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. Adjustments to our organic revenue growth outlook reduce our operational EPS estimates by approximately $0.08 per share at midpoint, which is offset by approximately $0.04 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments and positive below the line benefits from refinements to our net interest expense and effective tax rate outlook. We now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% and EPS by approximately $0.05 per share. In terms of our outlook for Q3, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 6% to 8%, net of an estimated 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange and incorporating approximately 0.5% in growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of approximately 6.5% to 8.5%, including approximately 1% to 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. We're planning for reported operating margins of 29.5% to 30.0% in Q3, down moderately on a comparable basis. This factors in year-on-year comparisons to relatively lower prior year sales and marketing expense levels, and projections for continued high year-on-year growth in R&D spending, including support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent performance against our strategic priorities and strong operational results in the second quarter. As we drive development of the companion animal diagnostics sector through a new wave of innovation and high quality customer engagement. These outcomes reflect high levels of execution and position IDEXX to benefit from long term growth tailwinds, including growth in a pet population, increased pet lifespans, and an ever strengthening bond between pet owners and their pets. These enduring dynamics combined to elevate the importance of medical services and drive global expansion of companion animal diagnostics and software. As an innovation leader, IDEXX growth continues to outpace the sector as we help our customers grow faster. Our progress is reflected in solid second quarter CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported by key execution drivers. This includes continued solid new business gains, sustained high 97% plus customer retention rates and solid net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX is focused on innovation and companion animal diagnostics has resulted in a highly compelling portfolio of products and services for our highly capable commercial teams to support our customers. This combination helped drive record second quarter global premium instrument placements, a double digit growth at our installed base of premium instruments, and five consecutive quarters of double digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Europe. We're delivering this performance as we work through some transitional growth headwinds that continue to pressure clinical visit growth levels. This includes ongoing staffing and productivity challenges, as well as broader impacts on pet owners in the current macro environment. As we work through these dynamics, we're continuing to deliver solid growth ahead of sector levels. Our customer engagement is helping to support gains in diagnostics, frequency and wellness visits, and continued expansion of diagnostics, utilization per clinical visit. Our customers increasingly appreciate that healthy and sustainable clinic growth begins with diagnostics. You can't assess basic health status or treat sick patients without first diagnosing and treatments, then require follow up monitoring. This has been our long term focus and we see significant underserved demand for an expanding pet population that will support long term growth for our customers in support of their mission. Today, I'll give an update on IDEXX's commercial execution and progress against our innovation strategy. IDEXX's commercial teams delivered record second quarter global premium instrument placements, growing off high prior year levels. A key driver of this growth was high interest in IDEXX products in international regions. Continued solid new and competitive Catalyst placements and strong placement growth of ProCyte and SediVue analyzers, coupled with high levels of retention and an excellent customer experience, helped deliver double digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base. Growth of our loyal installed base forms the foundation for our future recurring revenues and a significant long term opportunity for growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. ProCyte is a great example of our continued momentum in expanding our customers businesses through innovation, IDEXX sales professionals continue to support customers looking to upgrade from our legacy LaserCyte system to ProCyte One in order to realize multiple benefits from load-and-go reagents that simplify workflow to a smaller footprint, that frees up valuable benchtop space and inventory benefits due to its pay-per-run model with automated fulfillment by IDEXX. In addition to driving a better customer experience, IDEXX benefits from these upgrades in the form of increased loyalty and higher CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues at customers who upgrade. This customer interest and commercial effort helped drive our ProCyte One installed base to over 17,000 in just 3.5 years since this product launch. Upgrading to ProCyte One will also position these customers to benefit from the most comprehensive point-of-care hematology result when combined with inVue Dx blood morphology. While we are gratified by the consistent high levels of placements that our commercial teams deliver, we also focus on quality placements that will drive the most incremental value to IDEXX in the form of future recurring revenues. As an example, continued high placements at greenfield accounts drive significant value as these new customers are fully incremental to IDEXX. Our commercial teams are well equipped to have these initial conversations with de novo clinics and sustained high interest that our new practice program reflects their desire to partner with IDEXX since they launched their business. IDEXX's commercial success reflects our long-term focus on bringing a high-touch direct commercial model that includes a broad set of complementary roles, including account managers, professional service veterinarians and the largest in-person field service workforce in the industry. I'm also pleased to share that the entire North American commercial team met in person for several days in July to receive in-depth training on our latest innovations including Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test and IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer. As we prepare for the successful commercialization of a significant new wave of innovation our commercial teams are highly excited to begin taking orders for inVue Dx, the formal start of the commercialization process. IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer remains on track for launch in the fourth quarter. IDEXX product development teams have moved to the infield product validation stage to ensure early customers who adopt this transformational platform can seamlessly integrate inVue into their practice workflows and have the positive user experience they have come to expect for IDEXX products and services. We are seeing encouraging early performance and utilization metrics among the small number of analyzers currently being trialed in the field. Customers are praising the usability of inVue with all sites commenting that the workflow is intuitive and simple and the results are consistent, which will help them see more patients that drive clinical visit volume growth. I'm excited to provide more updates on inVue Dx and IDEXX's broader innovation agenda at our upcoming Annual Investor Day later this month. We're also on track to launch the recently announced Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test in the U.S. in the third quarter and globally in Q4. The Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients Spec to pancreatitis represents a 10 menu addition of the Catalyst platform since 2012. Pancreatitis is a common and treatable disease among cats and dogs, which can prove fatal if not caught early. Therefore, equipping veterinarians with quantitative results during the patient visit enables them to confidently diagnose and define the treatment envelope while the pet parent is still in the examination room. Our technology for life approach and the cloud-enabled in-clinic analyzers allow us to quickly ramp this highly relevant test to our more than 70,000 global Catalyst installed base. In addition to the new Catalyst Lipase Test, we'll begin shipping the Catalyst Smart QC clip in Q4. Customers are thrilled by the ability to run monthly QCs with a plug-and-go solution in other 15 minutes. Catalyst Smart QC is a great example of how our innovation is sometimes targeted at workflow optimization versus just testing new expansion. We have also begun rolling out the next generation of our industry leading IDEXX software and expect to have our installed base transition before inVue Dx begins shipping. This next generation takes our industry-leading IDEXX VetLab software and meaningfully improves the user interface and halves the number of steps needed to perform many common tasks. IDEXX software solutions are another area that delivers innovation-driven growth that addresses solutions that both improve clinic workflows and support greater utilization of diagnostics. Demand for intuitive cloud-based software solution remains high among a customer base that is increasingly reflective of younger generations who are digitally native. By leaning into this trend, IDEXX is well-positioned to continue to deliver a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem that provides efficiency gains through workflow and communication solutions. Q2 practice management orders were almost entirely cloud-based, building the foundation for strong future growth of economically attractive recurring revenues. IDEXX's attractive cloud-based solutions extend further, benefiting many areas of the practice. Facilitating payments, delivering digital workflow tools, and delivering an integrated pet owner engagement solution are just a few examples of how we're providing a robust software stack that is a win-win, delivering improved clinic productivity while driving incremental recurring revenues to IDEXX. For example, our recent launch of Vello, a pet owner engagement application, provides a first-of-its-kind pet owner engagement tool that is natively integrated into the practice management system. High interest in Vello is helping fill the sales pipeline and driving a solid increase in active customers in the first full quarter since launching the product. These customers are experiencing the benefits we saw in our early beta testers, from reduced no-shows to better compliance during clinical visits. As this customer base grows over the long-term, we see significant opportunity for Vello to help address the productivity challenges that exist at so many busy veterinary clinics, which is a meaningful benefit to our sector. We're building on the robust features of our customer engagement solution by integrating Greenline into our portfolio. Acquired in the first quarter, Greenline Pet is a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions. The tool provides veterinary clinics with the ability to connect their customers with leading animal health, pharmaceutical, and nutrition providers, making it easier for pet owners to take exceptional care of their pets. These higher standards of care reflect the sector development that is at the center of our long-term organic growth strategy. And as the sector grows, we expect IDEXX in turn to grow even faster, disproportionately benefiting us as the leader in the space. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank the nearly 11,000 global IDEXX employees for your outstanding work and commitment to providing a better future for animals, people, and our planet. Your contributions are essential to the progress we've made against our organic growth strategy and to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance. Thanks to your efforts, IDEXX is well positioned to build on this momentum through the second half 2024 and well beyond as we continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostic sector. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day later this month, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 14th, followed by presentations at our Global Headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 15th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live streamed and recorded via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for IDEXX leaders to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, long-term growth opportunity, innovation cycle, and execution drivers. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations; Dr. Mike Erickson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Point-of-Care Diagnostics and Telemedicine; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Schreck, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services; George Fennell, Senior Vice President, Chief Revenue Officer, and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. The event will last approximately 4 hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session. With that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I said kind of a 2-parter around visits. I guess, first, is what do you think, in your view, is the biggest delta between the outlook you gave in 1Q and the outlook you gave today in terms of what's happened to the market over the past few months? And the second part of that is probably more forward-looking. Are you still confident and I guess the more traditional kind of 2% or 3% vet visit growth rate as being an appropriate target over time? And maybe just help bridge us from what we're seeing today to what needs to happen to get back to that more traditional growth? Thank you.\nBrian McKeon: Thanks for your question, Chris. So I think just revisiting the outlook that we had given earlier in the year, we saw roughly 150 basis points of headwind coming out of the first quarter and carry that through or assumptions in the second quarter in the U.S. in terms of clinical visits and highlighted as we had coming out of 2023 that we thought there would be a flattening of trends over time. We had anticipated seeing some normalization with staffing effects and kind of working through some of those dynamics and thought that the clinic outlook would flatten. I think that as we work through Q2, we've continued to see a level of headwinds. I think we're acknowledging that there may be some macro dynamics going on here that we're working through and trying to capture that in the second half outlook. So that's the principal change. I'll let Jay talk more about the long-term drivers, but we continue to see a number of very positive long-term drivers for growth in demand and pet health care, including visit trends. And so we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we continue to have a very optimistic long-term outlook for the growth potential in this sector.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Good morning, Chris. Just a couple of words about the long-term trends. As Brian said, we continue to be very optimistic about that all the longer-term sort of secular tailwinds, we believe are intact. Obviously, it starts with the overall humanization of pets and that continues to strengthen appreciably and increasingly among the younger household owning pet where from a demographic standpoint, what they've shown, both in terms of intent and actual actions is willing to spend more and prioritize vis-a-vis categories like travel, entertainment going out. There's obviously a lot more, pet. So from a net adoption standpoint. If you take a look at this is really a global phenomenon. They're more and aging, and we know that as they age more is generally spent from both a health care - overall health care standpoint as well as diagnostics. Longer life spans, we'll provide an update on that on Investor Day. But we know both dogs and cats are living longer, and that's a good thing for both the pets, as well as the overall spend. And again, back to the prioritization, we think that this is a very resilient market. The pet owners are willing to spend and prioritize for the care at well-being of their pets. Maybe on a shorter term basis, just a couple of comments based on a number of ongoing conversations we have with veterinary practices there, very optimistic, and in terms of demand and the work that they're doing, they think they've made progress coming out of the pandemic around really retaining their staff, creating a more sustainable environment for both veterinarians and the veterinary technicians amongst their teams. They continue to invest in technology. We've seen that both from a software standpoint as well as point-of-care at record placements in Q2. As we said in our commentary, there are some high-level macro impacts that are affecting it likely at the margin, some moderation in clinical visits, but we're confident that we'll work through it, and we're working through it effectively as our customers.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hi, thanks guys. I kind of want to follow-up on that topic, but take it from a different perspective. Brian, Jay, during your prepared remarks, you talked about maybe shifting to that dynamics and you highlighted some of the diagnostics utilization trends and wellness visits versus non-wellness. I think you were kind of calling out that you were seeing less diagnostic in non-wellness, because pain management, and we assume Librela is rampant. There's visits where people come in, just get the shot and then walk out without any diagnostics tied to that. As part of that trend, I'm just wondering if maybe we could be seeing a broader shift in that channel dynamics. The pain management issue you mentioned, there's also a continuing shift to the online marketplace for therapeutics. All this can kind of lead to potentially less opportunity for diagnostics in the clinics office, because pet owners are getting their care elsewhere. I'm just wondering how you see that care delivery channel evolving and whether that could be having an impact to the growth profile. And then I'll throw in my follow-up question at the same time. You've updated the guide for this year to 7% organic. You did rounding 9% last year, and 7.5% the year before. So this is now kind of a three-year trend of pretty far below the LRP of 10% plus. We talked about vet visits. There was a point where there was a lot of concern on that supply in terms of insufficient vets and technicians out there. But it seems like this macro headwind continues to persist and refuse to get better. I'm just wondering, outside of price, what levers do you have to regain that 10%-plus LRP, and just confidence that you'll be able to get back there in 2025? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Why don't I start with your final question, because I think that will help center the discussion around visit trends, which I think was the first part of your question related to, Mike. Just in terms of the growth trends for the company. I think it's important to put them in the context of this post-pandemic period. I mean we had a 33% expansion in the business between 2020 and 2021. I would say the dynamic in 2022 that kind of played into the first half of 2023 was this capacity pullback effect at the clinics where they had trouble keeping up with the expanded demand, and it was fundamentally an impact on clinical visits. So we went from a positive 5% clinical business environment to a minus 3% environment in a relatively short period of time. And I think that, that was not foundational to the demand in the industry. I think it was this capacity dynamic and this transition from this extraordinary period of growth. And I think as we've moved forward from that, I think there has been kind of an ongoing dynamic again in this post-pandemic period related to staffing challenges and what has become a cumulative inflation impact on consumers broadly that's causing global trade-off. And all paths lead back to the fundamental dynamic that's changed is visits. And I think our premium has been quite healthy or placements net new business gains, customer retention all the dimensions that we look at in terms of how we're executing the business, we feel very good about, and we feel great about our innovation pipeline. So I think there are - as we look forward in the your question you had about moving ahead, I think we see positive long-term drivers in terms of sector trends and things that we're doing to drive demand in the business as well. So we feel very good about that. While acknowledging that we've been working through a clinical visit issue. So getting to some of the specifics that we highlighted this morning, I think one of the things we were trying to peel apart here on the visits was as you know, we look in the U.S. at the visit changes on the same-store level, diagnostic - frequency diagnostic utilization. And I think we do see some level of an impact on these metrics related to the pain mAbs. We try to pull this apart and we can see on wellness business, they're actually up year-on-year, 100 basis points, and that's been actually a trend we've seen for several quarters now. So a very healthy dynamic. When pet owners are coming into the clinic, they're doing more diagnostic testing. On normal testing those metrics were holding up through last year and where we started to see was change in those metrics beginning in Q4 and into the first half of this year, which aligns with the Librela kind of launch and kind of penetration. And so net-net, we didn't quantify this specifically, but basically, the frequency metric, which had built off of that high base expanded base in the dynamic, we think when you adjust for these type of dynamics or the pain mAbs dynamics probably sustained - continue to expand. And it might indicate there's a bit more weakness on the clinical visit front, particularly in non-wellness. And I think that's indicative of the macro headwinds that we've been highlighting. So again, I think this is, from our view, not foundational to our strategy or execution but more reflective of just the macro and the sector environment we're in at the moment.\nJay Mazelsky: Mike, let me address a couple of other questions you had embedded in there. First, around the alternate channels of care. What we see from an alternate channel venue standpoint, is it's largely complementary. I'm referring to some of the bricks-and-mortar places like TractorSupply or PetIQ and some of the clinics that they have, where these are pet owners and pets that don't often have relationships with veterinarians. Keep in mind, a lot of the pharmaceutical and therapeutics have to go through, have to go through the veterinarian and does have a good deal of medicine involved in terms of testing and diagnostics and follow up that really require a professional expertise. So we think that that's a, you know, a very positive thing. You know, and in terms of your question around levers that can positively impact growth. We continue to say just to build off of Brian's comments and observations, that innovation is just so important to this industry, not just in the standpoint of diagnostics and software, but therapeutics and specialty diets all of those things. We know that practices have a lot of unmet business needs, but also unsolved clinical problems where diagnostic solutions really make impactful contributions. If you think about you can't treat before you diagnose. You can't assess just basic health line status of the pet. When you do diagnose and the patient has an acute condition or a chronic condition, and often requires follow-up monitoring. So continue to innovate and work at the front end of a brand new wave of innovation. Some of which we've announced, including, you know, in view shipping in Q4 and Smart QC and pancreatic lipase or our catalyst platforms. Vello software to staff and be - there's just a significant amount of innovation that veterinarians can use as part of their tool set to continue to treat patients better. And we note that they look for that and as these short-term challenges are mitigated from a practice capacity challenge as well as the macro impacts that we believe that the growth prospects are excellent for the company.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. If you can speak to it, I guess, what was the nature of the legal charge and what's ongoing there? Is that a customer related relationship? Is there more to come on that front? And then your ability, though to control costs here is impressive. And that's obviously excluding the legal charge in the quarter. But can you talk about those levers you have to control costs and your ability to do that and until what we see, you know, until we see kind of things normalized from a market perspective. Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Great. Thanks for your question, Erin. Regarding the ongoing litigation matter, as we noted, we had a $62 million discrete expense accrual in the quarter. As a policy, we don't comment on ongoing litigation matters. We did include disclosures in the footnotes of the press release, and we have as well, disclosures that you can refer to in our first quarter 10-Q and our second quarter 10-Q in terms of the nature of this, but this was a, a an issue related to royalty payments over time. And we are, you know, what we've updated is our best estimate of the probable loss from that matter. In terms of your question on, operating expense leverage, I think, you know, adjusting for these items, I think you can see that we've continued to do a good job of adapting our, business financial performance to the growth environment that we're working through in terms of some of the sector headwinds for delivering strong execution, strong underlying comparable operating margin gains. We had expense growth that was basically in line with our revenue growth and very much focused on the things that we're doing to drive future growth through R&D agenda and our commercial investments. So as we've done consistently in the past, we have the ability to adapt and ensure we're prioritized against our long-term growth while delivering good financial performance, and we're able to do that again in the first half, and that's reinforced in our full year outlook as well.\nJay Mazelsky: Just a couple words to add to Brian's comments around the overall cost management. We continue to invest very heavily in those areas that we think are important to the long-term growth. The company, R&D, obviously, we're working through some significant new innovations, and so we don't want to starve that, and we're feeding that where there are commercial investments from territory expansion standpoint. We're obviously very excited to be able to invest in those areas. We see a very good return. What I would also say from a business and business model standpoint, these are businesses that have scale and that lend themselves the productivity in the investments from an automation and digitization standpoint and just overall network standpoint, whether you look at the Reference Labs. Obviously, the software business for us is a - it's a fast-growing business with very good drop-through, and so that's another lever that we have. But we're disciplined. We're able to adjust our expense and expense profile to whatever environment we're in.\nErin Wright: And then my follow-up is on innovation. Can you just remind us what's embedded in your guidance as it relates to inVue contribution this year? And it sounds like you're still on track in terms of your timing, but also F&A, when you anticipate that launch? And then also the timing of where you stand in terms of your other platform launch. I guess, should we expect to hear something about that potentially at your Investor Day? Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Erin, just to your point on the guidance, we've captured the expectations for the Q4 launch of inVue, and as you know, it's principally an instrument introduction. At that point, the recurring revenue will build over time.\nJay Mazelsky: And as is our policy, we'll talk about innovation as we get closer to launch. We look forward to Investor Day, and we'll just provide an update in terms of the overall company strategy and where we are from an innovation agenda standpoint, so look forward to having that conversation.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll just break apart my questions. I guess, Brian or Jay, I get the ongoing headwind from clinical visits, but when we isolate the U.S. IDEXX CAG Dx recurring premium that we've laid out a bunch of times. In other words, it sort of looks at the growth, sort of looks at the growth, X visits, X price. I get a premium of around 250 basis points this quarter. It's the lowest I can remember. It looks like an ongoing deceleration for roughly the past 10 quarters. So can you talk to that trend and what might be behind it? And then, you know, importantly, should we see that trend start to reverse course arguably in 2025 in the earlier days of the inVue launch? And then I'll ask my follow-up. Thanks.\nBrian McKeon: Yes. Thanks for your question, John. I think the - we've increasingly kind of broken down these metrics on an adjusted basis. We have a similar number to what you have if you're taking out the price in the days effects and comparing two clinical visits about 250 basis points. I think one item we noted, which I know you've been noting in your research, is there is this dynamic of the pain mAbs, a follow-up visits which we capture in our visit number and so I think that could particularly in the first half of this year be indicate that the underlying visits themselves maybe a bit softer relative to the visits that would have diagnostics and the premium might be that much stronger. So I think that the net of that as the premiums held up quite well from our lens, I think that we feel good about the key things that drive that. The net new business gains, customer retention levels, obviously, had a solid net price realization aligned with the value we're delivering. And so I think we're - we feel positive on that front. And factors like introduction of innovation are critical to go to helping to increase engagement with our customers to get the multiplier benefits that come from IDEXX innovation and leverage of our ecosystem. And so, I think we're looking forward to the InVue launch and the other initiatives that Jay had highlighted and we had something that can be intend to be a positive long-term driver for us. I'd also highlight just the solid performance internationally as well for the company. So it was a 10% overall growth organically tactics recurring there was a day's, present days had a benefit, but very solid growth, volume growth continues to be very positive, and we have excellent progress on issuer replacements, which will be a strong indicator of our long-term growth potential. So I think we're feeling very good about the execution metrics, and as we work through some of the visit headwinds that we've highlighted.\nJonathan Block: That was great color. Thanks, Brian. And for my second one, look you guys have done a great job and this year holding the EPS in light of the lighter revenue and some tax and some interest expense? How do we view that, Brian and it just better call overall efficiency from the company? Or do you think about any projects or initiatives it might come out at 2024 and go into 2025? And then the second sort of tag on question would be Jay just taking a step back and this goes back to sort of that pain mAbs thesis that we had a little bit. But is there anything to concerning about call it a wallet share battle, right? I mean just that the fact that a pet owner might be spending a $1,000 in cash and pay meds per annum, or atopic dermatitis per annum, and when we think about some of the potential accompanying diagnostic testing that that might suffer around the edges. Thanks for your time guys.\nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Let me answer to your second question first, and then I'll turn the front end part of the question to Brian. We aren't concerned about that to with from a diagnostics utilization standpoint. We think it remains a pretty - it's remained pretty constant from the launch of the payments themselves, primarily as a patient visit growth phenomenon that we spoke to related to some capacity challenges that practices are working through as well as the macroeconomic impacts. When you take a look at wellness, for example, we've seen the diagnostic and closure of 100 basis points. And Brian spoke to the effect of payment on the non- wellness, which is where we cataloged or characterize that. So when they're coming into the practice, they're using diagnostics and they're using diagnostics, both for wellness and non-wellness. So we haven't seen any evidence of that cannibalization impact.\nJay Mazelsky: Hi, John, your question on the margins, if I got that right, I think if the underlying performance that we've had this year reflects solid gross margin momentum. There are a number of drivers there. I think we've had ongoing benefits from cost management, things like labor productivity initiatives. software business as it's growing as meaningful to us. The business mix overall, just solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and growth in in-clinic revenues is a positive factor. And so - and just ongoing productivity in our operations functions coming out from a period where there was relatively more inflation. So, I think we feel that's been a consistent driver for us as a Company and we look forward to building on that as a foundation of how we can continue to improve our comparable operating margin performance.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Block: Hi. Thank you for taking the question and I am kind of going to go continue to theme about OpEx management and maybe slower growth relative to history. So, just as we look I mean I've tracked your market share gains over the last 10 years. And in Reference Labs, I think I've seen from like 40 to into the 50s, in terms of market share gains, do you think that we still have a lot of that left? Or do you think most of the growth is going to have to come via innovation and maybe just creating growth in new markets and really work on utilization in-clinic. And then I'll just ask my second question upfront. I usually, when I look at gross margins, you did beat me by 70 basis points. I usually look at consumables and Reference Labs as being the big drivers. I think one of the only one of those beat me. So just in terms of how you kind of got to that gross margin leverage. Thank you.\nJay Mazelsky: I'll take the front-end of your question and have Brian address the gross margin piece. David, if you take a look through the years, most of our growth has actually come through same-store sales. So we do very well competitively. We're pretty transparent in terms of disclosing it up and then and the progress we make, but we look from a growth algorithm standpoint to drive diagnostics utilization. Now a lot of that happened through innovation. There's also a big Technology for Life component that. But if you think about catalyst, for example, that tend to handle parameters 10 new slide over the last 12 years. So we know customers are just using more of that. If that means that the growth profile of the Company from a from a Reference Lab standpoint, the same phenomenon, if you think about critical antigen as an example of a quick growing category within our Reference Lab business, very important foundational part of wellness. We continue to expand that menu tapes and more recently, though, SaaS breast. So I've used more because it has more clinical value. That's how we think about it. Obviously, new platforms opened up a completely new, no retail space for us. And that's another element of our growth algorithm and the Investor Day Brian always - he always dissect sort of put some of the pieces together to show where that growth comes from the U.S. and internationally.\nBrian McKeon: Yes, indeed, even if in your margin question, I think in the quarter we highlighted that we had benefits from net price realization that offset inflationary cost impacts of software service margin gains and favorable business mix, which has driven by solid VetLab growth. I would highlight, I think we had strong flat margins in the prior year. And part of that was we were we were ramping staffing. So I think - some of the lab margins to the underlying productivity is very good. It was muted by a bit of a compare dynamic. But I think overall, I feel very good about the gross margin performance.\nJay Mazelsky: Now, I'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you to everyone on the phone for your participation in this morning's event. I'm very pleased to share another quarter of solid financial results as we continue to advance our strategy to drive development to the companion animal diagnostics sector and unwavering focus on innovation and our customers. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animal. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 10% organic gains in our water business. Solid CAG revenue growth was driven by global benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, reflected in sustained solid new business gains, record second quarter premium instrument placements and double-digit growth in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. Partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was constrained by impacts from near-term macro and sector headwinds, which contributed to a 2% decline in U.S. same store clinical visit growth levels in the quarter. IDEXX's operating performance reflected in solid comparable operating profit gains, continued to be strong in Q2. EPS in the quarter was $2.44, down 9% as reported, including a $0.56 per share impact from a $62 million discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Comparable EPS growth was 15% in the quarter, ahead of our expectations supported by solid gross margin gains and benefits from lower net interest costs and shares outstanding. IDEXX continues to make progress expanding our business, advancing our innovation agenda and delivering strong comparable profit gains as we work through near-term macro and sector headwinds that continue to pressure clinic visit levels. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends, which we estimate at midpoint will constrain overall organic revenue growth to the lower end of our original organic growth guidance for 2024. Our updated P&L guidance maintains our outlook for solid, comparable operating margin gains this year, and incorporates favorable adjustments for updated foreign exchange, net interest expense, and effective tax rate estimates. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 7% reflected 7% organic CAG gains, 10% organic growth in water and improved 3% organic growth in our LPD business. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic gains in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 12% organic growth and recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 5% organically building on high prior replacement levels. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q2 supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 5.5% with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by 10% international organic gains including approximately 1% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects in international regions. Strong international growth reflects benefits from net price realization and continued solid volume gains. International growth continues to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument install base. U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 5.2% in Q2, net of a 0.5% U.S. equivalent day growth headwind in the quarter. IDEXX growth was supported by solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels, and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX growth continues to expand at a high premium to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels which declined 1.8% in Q2. In the U.S., diagnostic utilization per clinical visit continues to expand solidly at the clinic level. This is reflected in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in diagnostic revenue dollars per clinical visit including diagnostics. While diagnostic frequency per clinical visit declined modestly in Q2, diagnostic frequency per wellness visit expanded 100 basis points. This partially offset lower diagnostic frequency per non-wellness visit. The decline in diagnostic frequency for non-wellness visits may reflect recent growth in fall clinical visits for pain management drug treatment which may not include diagnostics. Adjusting for these effects would imply relatively softer comparable U.S. clinical visit trends and a relatively higher IDEXX growth premium. Overall, IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic revenue growth in CAG diagnostic revenues as we work through headwinds from broader cumulative macro impacts on consumers which are likely pressuring near-term U.S. clinical visit growth levels. While we remain highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation, we factored in expectations for continued pressure from lower U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2024 and our updated full-year organic growth outlook. IDEXX execution drivers supported solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q2. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically reflecting solid gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology and SediVue outcomes. We achieved the Q2 record 4,952 CAG premium instrument placements, an increase of 4% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. These results were supported by continued strong growth and Premium Hematology and SediVue placements. ProCyte One momentum continues with the ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 17,000 instruments. Global Catalyst placement decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels in placement mix in international regions. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 6% organically in Q2, driven by solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues also increased 6% organically, reflecting solid U.S. gains and high single-digit growth in international regions. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 12% as reported including benefits from a recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 8% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 12% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud based software placements. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues increased 3% organically. Continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe offset lower Asia-Pacific revenues, including impacts from reduced swine testing in China and lower herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter, as reported, and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.7%, up 90 basis points on the comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflect benefits from net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts. Software service margin gains and favorable business mix. On a reported basis operating expenses increased 28% year-on-year, including 22% of growth impact related to the $62 million discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in G&A. Excluding this impact, Q2 OpEx growth was in line with overall revenue growth, driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. On a reported basis, operating margins were 26.3% in the quarter, including a 610 basis point impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. On a comparable basis, excluding this impact, operating margins increased approximately 110 basis points year-on-year. EPS was $2.44 per share in the quarter, a decrease of 9% as reported, including the $0.56 per share impact related to the discrete litigation expense accrual. EPS increased 15% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced revenues by approximately $7 million, operating profit by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter, net of a $2 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $215 million in Q2. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 99%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively. We allocated $208 million in capital to share repurchases in the second quarter, supporting a 0.7% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year organic growth outlook to reflect expectations for continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit trends in the second half of 2024. Our P&L outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid, comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for foreign exchange impacts, net interest expense, and our effective tax rate. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,885 million to $3,945 million, a reduction of $15 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent foreign exchange estimates. We've updated our full year guidance for overall organic revenue growth and CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth to 6.2% to 7.8%, or approximately 7%, at midpoint. Our outlook for overall organic revenue growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostics reporting revenue gains supported by IDEXX execution. This includes consistent expectations for full year global net price improvement of approximately 5%. Our updated organic growth outlook at midpoint assumes IDEXX execution growth benefits will be partially offset by continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit levels in the second half of this year similar to first half trends. We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results will benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects reflecting 1% to 1.5% organic growth rate benefits in Q3. In terms of our profit guidance, our updated outlook incorporates impacts from the discrete litigation expense accrual, which we estimate will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. We will normalize for the effects of this accrual in setting our 2025 financial performance goals. Incorporating these impacts, our updated reported operating margin outlook is 28.7% to 29.0%. This reflects a consistent 40 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins at midpoint net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.31 to $10.59 per share is down $0.56 per share at midpoint, reflecting the impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. Adjustments to our organic revenue growth outlook reduce our operational EPS estimates by approximately $0.08 per share at midpoint, which is offset by approximately $0.04 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments and positive below the line benefits from refinements to our net interest expense and effective tax rate outlook. We now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% and EPS by approximately $0.05 per share. In terms of our outlook for Q3, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 6% to 8%, net of an estimated 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange and incorporating approximately 0.5% in growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of approximately 6.5% to 8.5%, including approximately 1% to 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. We're planning for reported operating margins of 29.5% to 30.0% in Q3, down moderately on a comparable basis. This factors in year-on-year comparisons to relatively lower prior year sales and marketing expense levels, and projections for continued high year-on-year growth in R&D spending, including support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for your question, Chris. So I think just revisiting the outlook that we had given earlier in the year, we saw roughly 150 basis points of headwind coming out of the first quarter and carry that through or assumptions in the second quarter in the U.S. in terms of clinical visits and highlighted as we had coming out of 2023 that we thought there would be a flattening of trends over time. We had anticipated seeing some normalization with staffing effects and kind of working through some of those dynamics and thought that the clinic outlook would flatten. I think that as we work through Q2, we've continued to see a level of headwinds. I think we're acknowledging that there may be some macro dynamics going on here that we're working through and trying to capture that in the second half outlook. So that's the principal change. I'll let Jay talk more about the long-term drivers, but we continue to see a number of very positive long-term drivers for growth in demand and pet health care, including visit trends. And so we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we continue to have a very optimistic long-term outlook for the growth potential in this sector. Why don't I start with your final question, because I think that will help center the discussion around visit trends, which I think was the first part of your question related to, Mike. Just in terms of the growth trends for the company. I think it's important to put them in the context of this post-pandemic period. I mean we had a 33% expansion in the business between 2020 and 2021. I would say the dynamic in 2022 that kind of played into the first half of 2023 was this capacity pullback effect at the clinics where they had trouble keeping up with the expanded demand, and it was fundamentally an impact on clinical visits. So we went from a positive 5% clinical business environment to a minus 3% environment in a relatively short period of time. And I think that, that was not foundational to the demand in the industry. I think it was this capacity dynamic and this transition from this extraordinary period of growth. And I think as we've moved forward from that, I think there has been kind of an ongoing dynamic again in this post-pandemic period related to staffing challenges and what has become a cumulative inflation impact on consumers broadly that's causing global trade-off. And all paths lead back to the fundamental dynamic that's changed is visits. And I think our premium has been quite healthy or placements net new business gains, customer retention all the dimensions that we look at in terms of how we're executing the business, we feel very good about, and we feel great about our innovation pipeline. So I think there are - as we look forward in the your question you had about moving ahead, I think we see positive long-term drivers in terms of sector trends and things that we're doing to drive demand in the business as well. So we feel very good about that. While acknowledging that we've been working through a clinical visit issue. So getting to some of the specifics that we highlighted this morning, I think one of the things we were trying to peel apart here on the visits was as you know, we look in the U.S. at the visit changes on the same-store level, diagnostic - frequency diagnostic utilization. And I think we do see some level of an impact on these metrics related to the pain mAbs. We try to pull this apart and we can see on wellness business, they're actually up year-on-year, 100 basis points, and that's been actually a trend we've seen for several quarters now. So a very healthy dynamic. When pet owners are coming into the clinic, they're doing more diagnostic testing. On normal testing those metrics were holding up through last year and where we started to see was change in those metrics beginning in Q4 and into the first half of this year, which aligns with the Librela kind of launch and kind of penetration. And so net-net, we didn't quantify this specifically, but basically, the frequency metric, which had built off of that high base expanded base in the dynamic, we think when you adjust for these type of dynamics or the pain mAbs dynamics probably sustained - continue to expand. And it might indicate there's a bit more weakness on the clinical visit front, particularly in non-wellness. And I think that's indicative of the macro headwinds that we've been highlighting. So again, I think this is, from our view, not foundational to our strategy or execution but more reflective of just the macro and the sector environment we're in at the moment. Great. Thanks for your question, Erin. Regarding the ongoing litigation matter, as we noted, we had a $62 million discrete expense accrual in the quarter. As a policy, we don't comment on ongoing litigation matters. We did include disclosures in the footnotes of the press release, and we have as well, disclosures that you can refer to in our first quarter 10-Q and our second quarter 10-Q in terms of the nature of this, but this was a, a an issue related to royalty payments over time. And we are, you know, what we've updated is our best estimate of the probable loss from that matter. In terms of your question on, operating expense leverage, I think, you know, adjusting for these items, I think you can see that we've continued to do a good job of adapting our, business financial performance to the growth environment that we're working through in terms of some of the sector headwinds for delivering strong execution, strong underlying comparable operating margin gains. We had expense growth that was basically in line with our revenue growth and very much focused on the things that we're doing to drive future growth through R&D agenda and our commercial investments. So as we've done consistently in the past, we have the ability to adapt and ensure we're prioritized against our long-term growth while delivering good financial performance, and we're able to do that again in the first half, and that's reinforced in our full year outlook as well. Erin, just to your point on the guidance, we've captured the expectations for the Q4 launch of inVue, and as you know, it's principally an instrument introduction. At that point, the recurring revenue will build over time. Yes. Thanks for your question, John. I think the - we've increasingly kind of broken down these metrics on an adjusted basis. We have a similar number to what you have if you're taking out the price in the days effects and comparing two clinical visits about 250 basis points. I think one item we noted, which I know you've been noting in your research, is there is this dynamic of the pain mAbs, a follow-up visits which we capture in our visit number and so I think that could particularly in the first half of this year be indicate that the underlying visits themselves maybe a bit softer relative to the visits that would have diagnostics and the premium might be that much stronger. So I think that the net of that as the premiums held up quite well from our lens, I think that we feel good about the key things that drive that. The net new business gains, customer retention levels, obviously, had a solid net price realization aligned with the value we're delivering. And so I think we're - we feel positive on that front. And factors like introduction of innovation are critical to go to helping to increase engagement with our customers to get the multiplier benefits that come from IDEXX innovation and leverage of our ecosystem. And so, I think we're looking forward to the InVue launch and the other initiatives that Jay had highlighted and we had something that can be intend to be a positive long-term driver for us. I'd also highlight just the solid performance internationally as well for the company. So it was a 10% overall growth organically tactics recurring there was a day's, present days had a benefit, but very solid growth, volume growth continues to be very positive, and we have excellent progress on issuer replacements, which will be a strong indicator of our long-term growth potential. So I think we're feeling very good about the execution metrics, and as we work through some of the visit headwinds that we've highlighted. Yes, indeed, even if in your margin question, I think in the quarter we highlighted that we had benefits from net price realization that offset inflationary cost impacts of software service margin gains and favorable business mix, which has driven by solid VetLab growth. I would highlight, I think we had strong flat margins in the prior year. And part of that was we were we were ramping staffing. So I think - some of the lab margins to the underlying productivity is very good. It was muted by a bit of a compare dynamic. But I think overall, I feel very good about the gross margin performance."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent performance against our strategic priorities and strong operational results in the second quarter. As we drive development of the companion animal diagnostics sector through a new wave of innovation and high quality customer engagement. These outcomes reflect high levels of execution and position IDEXX to benefit from long term growth tailwinds, including growth in a pet population, increased pet lifespans, and an ever strengthening bond between pet owners and their pets. These enduring dynamics combined to elevate the importance of medical services and drive global expansion of companion animal diagnostics and software. As an innovation leader, IDEXX growth continues to outpace the sector as we help our customers grow faster. Our progress is reflected in solid second quarter CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported by key execution drivers. This includes continued solid new business gains, sustained high 97% plus customer retention rates and solid net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX is focused on innovation and companion animal diagnostics has resulted in a highly compelling portfolio of products and services for our highly capable commercial teams to support our customers. This combination helped drive record second quarter global premium instrument placements, a double digit growth at our installed base of premium instruments, and five consecutive quarters of double digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Europe. We're delivering this performance as we work through some transitional growth headwinds that continue to pressure clinical visit growth levels. This includes ongoing staffing and productivity challenges, as well as broader impacts on pet owners in the current macro environment. As we work through these dynamics, we're continuing to deliver solid growth ahead of sector levels. Our customer engagement is helping to support gains in diagnostics, frequency and wellness visits, and continued expansion of diagnostics, utilization per clinical visit. Our customers increasingly appreciate that healthy and sustainable clinic growth begins with diagnostics. You can't assess basic health status or treat sick patients without first diagnosing and treatments, then require follow up monitoring. This has been our long term focus and we see significant underserved demand for an expanding pet population that will support long term growth for our customers in support of their mission. Today, I'll give an update on IDEXX's commercial execution and progress against our innovation strategy. IDEXX's commercial teams delivered record second quarter global premium instrument placements, growing off high prior year levels. A key driver of this growth was high interest in IDEXX products in international regions. Continued solid new and competitive Catalyst placements and strong placement growth of ProCyte and SediVue analyzers, coupled with high levels of retention and an excellent customer experience, helped deliver double digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base. Growth of our loyal installed base forms the foundation for our future recurring revenues and a significant long term opportunity for growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. ProCyte is a great example of our continued momentum in expanding our customers businesses through innovation, IDEXX sales professionals continue to support customers looking to upgrade from our legacy LaserCyte system to ProCyte One in order to realize multiple benefits from load-and-go reagents that simplify workflow to a smaller footprint, that frees up valuable benchtop space and inventory benefits due to its pay-per-run model with automated fulfillment by IDEXX. In addition to driving a better customer experience, IDEXX benefits from these upgrades in the form of increased loyalty and higher CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues at customers who upgrade. This customer interest and commercial effort helped drive our ProCyte One installed base to over 17,000 in just 3.5 years since this product launch. Upgrading to ProCyte One will also position these customers to benefit from the most comprehensive point-of-care hematology result when combined with inVue Dx blood morphology. While we are gratified by the consistent high levels of placements that our commercial teams deliver, we also focus on quality placements that will drive the most incremental value to IDEXX in the form of future recurring revenues. As an example, continued high placements at greenfield accounts drive significant value as these new customers are fully incremental to IDEXX. Our commercial teams are well equipped to have these initial conversations with de novo clinics and sustained high interest that our new practice program reflects their desire to partner with IDEXX since they launched their business. IDEXX's commercial success reflects our long-term focus on bringing a high-touch direct commercial model that includes a broad set of complementary roles, including account managers, professional service veterinarians and the largest in-person field service workforce in the industry. I'm also pleased to share that the entire North American commercial team met in person for several days in July to receive in-depth training on our latest innovations including Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test and IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer. As we prepare for the successful commercialization of a significant new wave of innovation our commercial teams are highly excited to begin taking orders for inVue Dx, the formal start of the commercialization process. IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer remains on track for launch in the fourth quarter. IDEXX product development teams have moved to the infield product validation stage to ensure early customers who adopt this transformational platform can seamlessly integrate inVue into their practice workflows and have the positive user experience they have come to expect for IDEXX products and services. We are seeing encouraging early performance and utilization metrics among the small number of analyzers currently being trialed in the field. Customers are praising the usability of inVue with all sites commenting that the workflow is intuitive and simple and the results are consistent, which will help them see more patients that drive clinical visit volume growth. I'm excited to provide more updates on inVue Dx and IDEXX's broader innovation agenda at our upcoming Annual Investor Day later this month. We're also on track to launch the recently announced Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test in the U.S. in the third quarter and globally in Q4. The Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients Spec to pancreatitis represents a 10 menu addition of the Catalyst platform since 2012. Pancreatitis is a common and treatable disease among cats and dogs, which can prove fatal if not caught early. Therefore, equipping veterinarians with quantitative results during the patient visit enables them to confidently diagnose and define the treatment envelope while the pet parent is still in the examination room. Our technology for life approach and the cloud-enabled in-clinic analyzers allow us to quickly ramp this highly relevant test to our more than 70,000 global Catalyst installed base. In addition to the new Catalyst Lipase Test, we'll begin shipping the Catalyst Smart QC clip in Q4. Customers are thrilled by the ability to run monthly QCs with a plug-and-go solution in other 15 minutes. Catalyst Smart QC is a great example of how our innovation is sometimes targeted at workflow optimization versus just testing new expansion. We have also begun rolling out the next generation of our industry leading IDEXX software and expect to have our installed base transition before inVue Dx begins shipping. This next generation takes our industry-leading IDEXX VetLab software and meaningfully improves the user interface and halves the number of steps needed to perform many common tasks. IDEXX software solutions are another area that delivers innovation-driven growth that addresses solutions that both improve clinic workflows and support greater utilization of diagnostics. Demand for intuitive cloud-based software solution remains high among a customer base that is increasingly reflective of younger generations who are digitally native. By leaning into this trend, IDEXX is well-positioned to continue to deliver a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem that provides efficiency gains through workflow and communication solutions. Q2 practice management orders were almost entirely cloud-based, building the foundation for strong future growth of economically attractive recurring revenues. IDEXX's attractive cloud-based solutions extend further, benefiting many areas of the practice. Facilitating payments, delivering digital workflow tools, and delivering an integrated pet owner engagement solution are just a few examples of how we're providing a robust software stack that is a win-win, delivering improved clinic productivity while driving incremental recurring revenues to IDEXX. For example, our recent launch of Vello, a pet owner engagement application, provides a first-of-its-kind pet owner engagement tool that is natively integrated into the practice management system. High interest in Vello is helping fill the sales pipeline and driving a solid increase in active customers in the first full quarter since launching the product. These customers are experiencing the benefits we saw in our early beta testers, from reduced no-shows to better compliance during clinical visits. As this customer base grows over the long-term, we see significant opportunity for Vello to help address the productivity challenges that exist at so many busy veterinary clinics, which is a meaningful benefit to our sector. We're building on the robust features of our customer engagement solution by integrating Greenline into our portfolio. Acquired in the first quarter, Greenline Pet is a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions. The tool provides veterinary clinics with the ability to connect their customers with leading animal health, pharmaceutical, and nutrition providers, making it easier for pet owners to take exceptional care of their pets. These higher standards of care reflect the sector development that is at the center of our long-term organic growth strategy. And as the sector grows, we expect IDEXX in turn to grow even faster, disproportionately benefiting us as the leader in the space. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank the nearly 11,000 global IDEXX employees for your outstanding work and commitment to providing a better future for animals, people, and our planet. Your contributions are essential to the progress we've made against our organic growth strategy and to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance. Thanks to your efforts, IDEXX is well positioned to build on this momentum through the second half 2024 and well beyond as we continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostic sector. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day later this month, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 14th, followed by presentations at our Global Headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 15th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live streamed and recorded via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for IDEXX leaders to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, long-term growth opportunity, innovation cycle, and execution drivers. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations; Dr. Mike Erickson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Point-of-Care Diagnostics and Telemedicine; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Schreck, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services; George Fennell, Senior Vice President, Chief Revenue Officer, and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. The event will last approximately 4 hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session. With that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Yes. Good morning, Chris. Just a couple of words about the long-term trends. As Brian said, we continue to be very optimistic about that all the longer-term sort of secular tailwinds, we believe are intact. Obviously, it starts with the overall humanization of pets and that continues to strengthen appreciably and increasingly among the younger household owning pet where from a demographic standpoint, what they've shown, both in terms of intent and actual actions is willing to spend more and prioritize vis-a-vis categories like travel, entertainment going out. There's obviously a lot more, pet. So from a net adoption standpoint. If you take a look at this is really a global phenomenon. They're more and aging, and we know that as they age more is generally spent from both a health care - overall health care standpoint as well as diagnostics. Longer life spans, we'll provide an update on that on Investor Day. But we know both dogs and cats are living longer, and that's a good thing for both the pets, as well as the overall spend. And again, back to the prioritization, we think that this is a very resilient market. The pet owners are willing to spend and prioritize for the care at well-being of their pets. Maybe on a shorter term basis, just a couple of comments based on a number of ongoing conversations we have with veterinary practices there, very optimistic, and in terms of demand and the work that they're doing, they think they've made progress coming out of the pandemic around really retaining their staff, creating a more sustainable environment for both veterinarians and the veterinary technicians amongst their teams. They continue to invest in technology. We've seen that both from a software standpoint as well as point-of-care at record placements in Q2. As we said in our commentary, there are some high-level macro impacts that are affecting it likely at the margin, some moderation in clinical visits, but we're confident that we'll work through it, and we're working through it effectively as our customers. Mike, let me address a couple of other questions you had embedded in there. First, around the alternate channels of care. What we see from an alternate channel venue standpoint, is it's largely complementary. I'm referring to some of the bricks-and-mortar places like TractorSupply or PetIQ and some of the clinics that they have, where these are pet owners and pets that don't often have relationships with veterinarians. Keep in mind, a lot of the pharmaceutical and therapeutics have to go through, have to go through the veterinarian and does have a good deal of medicine involved in terms of testing and diagnostics and follow up that really require a professional expertise. So we think that that's a, you know, a very positive thing. You know, and in terms of your question around levers that can positively impact growth. We continue to say just to build off of Brian's comments and observations, that innovation is just so important to this industry, not just in the standpoint of diagnostics and software, but therapeutics and specialty diets all of those things. We know that practices have a lot of unmet business needs, but also unsolved clinical problems where diagnostic solutions really make impactful contributions. If you think about you can't treat before you diagnose. You can't assess just basic health line status of the pet. When you do diagnose and the patient has an acute condition or a chronic condition, and often requires follow-up monitoring. So continue to innovate and work at the front end of a brand new wave of innovation. Some of which we've announced, including, you know, in view shipping in Q4 and Smart QC and pancreatic lipase or our catalyst platforms. Vello software to staff and be - there's just a significant amount of innovation that veterinarians can use as part of their tool set to continue to treat patients better. And we note that they look for that and as these short-term challenges are mitigated from a practice capacity challenge as well as the macro impacts that we believe that the growth prospects are excellent for the company. Just a couple words to add to Brian's comments around the overall cost management. We continue to invest very heavily in those areas that we think are important to the long-term growth. The company, R&D, obviously, we're working through some significant new innovations, and so we don't want to starve that, and we're feeding that where there are commercial investments from territory expansion standpoint. We're obviously very excited to be able to invest in those areas. We see a very good return. What I would also say from a business and business model standpoint, these are businesses that have scale and that lend themselves the productivity in the investments from an automation and digitization standpoint and just overall network standpoint, whether you look at the Reference Labs. Obviously, the software business for us is a - it's a fast-growing business with very good drop-through, and so that's another lever that we have. But we're disciplined. We're able to adjust our expense and expense profile to whatever environment we're in. And as is our policy, we'll talk about innovation as we get closer to launch. We look forward to Investor Day, and we'll just provide an update in terms of the overall company strategy and where we are from an innovation agenda standpoint, so look forward to having that conversation. Yes. Let me answer to your second question first, and then I'll turn the front end part of the question to Brian. We aren't concerned about that to with from a diagnostics utilization standpoint. We think it remains a pretty - it's remained pretty constant from the launch of the payments themselves, primarily as a patient visit growth phenomenon that we spoke to related to some capacity challenges that practices are working through as well as the macroeconomic impacts. When you take a look at wellness, for example, we've seen the diagnostic and closure of 100 basis points. And Brian spoke to the effect of payment on the non- wellness, which is where we cataloged or characterize that. So when they're coming into the practice, they're using diagnostics and they're using diagnostics, both for wellness and non-wellness. So we haven't seen any evidence of that cannibalization impact. Hi, John, your question on the margins, if I got that right, I think if the underlying performance that we've had this year reflects solid gross margin momentum. There are a number of drivers there. I think we've had ongoing benefits from cost management, things like labor productivity initiatives. software business as it's growing as meaningful to us. The business mix overall, just solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and growth in in-clinic revenues is a positive factor. And so - and just ongoing productivity in our operations functions coming out from a period where there was relatively more inflation. So, I think we feel that's been a consistent driver for us as a Company and we look forward to building on that as a foundation of how we can continue to improve our comparable operating margin performance. I'll take the front-end of your question and have Brian address the gross margin piece. David, if you take a look through the years, most of our growth has actually come through same-store sales. So we do very well competitively. We're pretty transparent in terms of disclosing it up and then and the progress we make, but we look from a growth algorithm standpoint to drive diagnostics utilization. Now a lot of that happened through innovation. There's also a big Technology for Life component that. But if you think about catalyst, for example, that tend to handle parameters 10 new slide over the last 12 years. So we know customers are just using more of that. If that means that the growth profile of the Company from a from a Reference Lab standpoint, the same phenomenon, if you think about critical antigen as an example of a quick growing category within our Reference Lab business, very important foundational part of wellness. We continue to expand that menu tapes and more recently, though, SaaS breast. So I've used more because it has more clinical value. That's how we think about it. Obviously, new platforms opened up a completely new, no retail space for us. And that's another element of our growth algorithm and the Investor Day Brian always - he always dissect sort of put some of the pieces together to show where that growth comes from the U.S. and internationally. Now, I'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you to everyone on the phone for your participation in this morning's event. I'm very pleased to share another quarter of solid financial results as we continue to advance our strategy to drive development to the companion animal diagnostics sector and unwavering focus on innovation and our customers. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animal. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. \n IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. \n During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our first quarter 2024 results and updated 2024 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless otherwise noted. \n To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to idexx.com Investors after the earnings conference call concludes. \n I would like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. \nBrian McKeon: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q1 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. \n In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth and strong profit gains in the first quarter. Overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Solid revenue gains were net of negative growth effects from severe U.S. weather in January which we estimated lowered overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by 0.5% to 1% and added pressure to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels. IDEXX execution trends remained strong, reflected in a continued high IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium, 8% global gains in premium instrument placements and 11% organic gains in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. \n Profit delivery was excellent in the quarter, supported by gross margin gains. Strong operating margin performance enabled EPS delivery of $2.81 per share. EPS was up 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth impact for the lapping of a prior year customer contract resolution payment. \n Overall, we're pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business and delivering strong financial performance as we continue to work through sector and macro factors that have constrained visit growth at veterinary clinics. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends which we estimate will constrain the high end of our full year organic growth outlook this year. \n We've also incorporated updated estimates for foreign exchange effects to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Building on our strong first quarter performance, we're reinforcing our operational EPS outlook at midpoint. This reflects consistent goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement this year and favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. \n First quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by 7% organic CAG gains and 11% organic growth in our Water business, with overall gains moderated by a 3% organic growth decline in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic gains in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 3% organically, building on high prior year placement levels. \n CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q1, supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 6%, with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q1 reflected solid gains across our major regions. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 9% reflecting benefits from net price realization and solid volume gains, building on 2023 second half momentum. International results continue to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong business gains and high premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. \n U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 6.5% in Q1, which reflects a continued significant growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2.3% overall in the quarter, including negative impacts from severe January weather. IDEXX's solid growth results reflect sustained levels of diagnostic frequency and increased diagnostic utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. It also reflects benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and net price realization. \n Excluding estimated weather impacts, U.S. clinical visit growth levels in the first quarter were relatively softer than targeted in our midpoint outlook. These trends reflect ongoing staffing challenges at veterinary clinics and potentially pressure on U.S. consumers from broader cumulative macro impacts. While pet owner demand for health care services remains durable and resilient, and we're confident in IDEXX's ability to execute and drive continued solid organic revenue growth, we believe it's prudent to factor these near-term sector trends into our outlook. This is reflected in adjustments to the high end of our 2024 full year organic revenue growth guidance. \n IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and double-digit organic growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,791 CAG premium instrument placements in Q1, an increase of 8% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. This was supported by strong growth in ProCyte One placements with the global ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 15,000 instruments. \n Global Catalyst placements decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels and shifts in placement mix in the international regions. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 5% organically in Q1 driven by high single-digit gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 6% organically, reflecting similar solid gains in the U.S. and international regions. \n Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 12% as reported, including benefits from our recent software and data platform acquisition, which adds to our software ecosystem. 8% overall organic gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. \n Water revenues increased 11% organically in Q1, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and Europe, including benefits from higher shipment order timing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 3% organically. Solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were moderated by lower Asia Pacific revenues, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing in comparison to higher prior year swine testing levels in China. We expect these negative growth impacts to moderate in the second half of 2024. \n Turning to the P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from business mix, lower instrument costs and software service margin expansion. \n On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year including approximately 6.5% of overall growth impact related to the lapping of a prior $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Q1 OpEx growth was driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. EPS was $2.81 per share in Q1, an increase of 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth rate impact related to the lapping of the prior year customer contract resolution payment. Foreign exchange had a limited impact on gross margin, operating profits and EPS in the quarter, net of a $1 million hedge gain. \n Free cash flow was $168 million in Q1, reflecting normal seasonality. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 92%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. \n Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively in the current interest rate environment. We allocated $155 million in capital to share repurchases in the first quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to prior year levels. \n Turning to 2024 guidance. We've updated our full year P&L outlook to reflect adjustments to the high end of our full year organic growth goals. Our outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense. We've also revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. \n In terms of our revenue outlook, we've updated our full year guidance for reported revenues to $3.895 billion to $3.965 billion, a reduction of $55 million at midpoint. Compared to earlier estimates, our updated reported revenue outlook includes a $35 million or approximately 1% negative growth rate impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've also lowered the high end of our full year organic growth outlook by 1% to capture more recent trends for U.S. clinical visits, which have constrained the organic revenue growth outlook for the first half of 2024. \n Our updated full year guidance for overall organic growth is now 7% to 9%, supported by 7.5% to 9.5% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. For the full year, our outlook for overall organic growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains, supported by IDEXX execution. Our midpoint outlook aligns with expectations of approximately 1.5% declines in U.S. clinic visits in Q2, similar to late Q1 trends. The second half of 2024, our midpoint outlook continues to assume a relative flattening of U.S. clinical visit trends. \n We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results to benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects, reflecting approximately 1% organic growth rate benefits in Q3 with limited overall effects to full year growth. Our full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook reflects consistent expectations for global net price improvement of approximately 5%. \n In terms of our profit guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for reported operating margins of 30.2% to 30.7% for the full year 2024, supported by continued high levels of operating execution. This outlook aligns with 20 to 70 basis points in full year comparable operating margin expansion, net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. \n Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.82 to $11.20 per share is down $0.08 per share at midpoint, driven by our updated foreign exchange estimates. We now estimate foreign exchange will have a negative $0.09 per share full year EPS impact, $0.11 per share unfavorable to prior estimates. Operationally, reductions to the high end of our organic revenue growth guidance are mitigated by our sustained operating margin improvement outlook by approximately $0.06 per share of net favorability from updated net interest expense projections. \n In terms of our outlook for Q2, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% growth headwind from FX. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8.5% and incorporates growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. As noted, at midpoint, the Q2 organic revenue growth outlook aligns with the relatively softer U.S. clinical visit growth trends seen at the end of the first quarter. \n We're planning for reported operating margins of 31.0% to 31.4% in Q2, flat to down moderately on a comparable basis, factoring in projections for relatively higher quarterly R&D spending in support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. \n I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. \nJay Mazelsky: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to the year as we continue to advance our strategy to drive the development of the Companion Animal diagnostics sector through innovation and customer engagement. Our ongoing progress benefits from the durable secular growth drivers that have supported the multi-decade expansion of Companion Animal Medical Services. These drivers include growth in the pet population in the strengthened human pet bond as well as the ongoing expansion of pet healthcare services. Medical services is in turn enabled by diagnostics and is a key element of vet clinic growth and profitability. \n IDEXX's business strategy is focused on enabling long-term sector growth by providing unparalleled diagnostic insight through our leading testing and software solutions. This is supported by a robust innovation agenda and a high-touch customer-centered commercial model that helps clinicians test with confidence in an intuitive and efficient way, supporting their mission of delivering high levels of care. \n Our strategy is brought to life by teams across IDEXX, who collectively executed at a high level in the quarter, reflected in continued global expansion of our Diagnostics and Software Solutions and solid growth in recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues once again grew at a healthy premium to the sector, supported by solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization that reflects the increased value that our products and services deliver to our customers. IDEXX commercial teams delivered strong growth in global premium instrument placements, reflecting high interest in adopting IDEXX's point-of-care innovations including expansion of our newest platform solution, ProCyte One. \n Cloud-based software placements once again expanded in the quarter, reflecting vet clinic interest in cloud-native solutions and the IDEXX full stack software suite that continues to advance in scope and functionality. These gains supported double-digit organic growth in recurring software revenues as veterinarians turn to IDEXX to help them grow their practices and drive productivity. As Brian noted, we continue to work through dynamics in terms of staffing challenges and broader pressure on consumers that have impacted clinic visit growth levels. \n Our strong business performance demonstrates our ability to work through these near-term challenges while continuing to expand our business globally to deliver strong financial performance and advance key drivers of our long-term growth strategy and potential. Today, I'll provide an overview of IDEXX's progress against our strategic initiatives during the first quarter. Let's start with an update on our commercial efforts, which are key to driving the adoption and utilization of IDEXX's testing and software solutions. \n IDEXX commercial teams continue to execute at a high level, bringing a customer-first mindset to their work, helping IDEXX's customers to grow faster. Intuitive point of care testing platforms are foundational to this approach. Customer adoption of IDEXX solutions remains high globally, reflected in record first quarter global premium instrument placements for the third consecutive year. This performance, combined with the ability to retain our customers at consistently high levels by delivering an excellent user experience resulted in double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, in total and individually for in-clinic chemistry, premium hematology and urinalysis platforms. This progress is aligned with the approximately 220,000 global placement opportunity we see today for our business. \n A key area of commercial focus is international regions that are at earlier stages of development than the U.S. and provide a relatively more greenfield growth opportunity. Leveraging the successful commercial playbook we have developed from our decades of experience in the U.S., our international sales teams continue to deliver high international installed base growth. Progress on this front is reflected in strong international premium instrument placement gains supported by continued global expansion of our new platform innovations such as ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides significant benefits compared to our legacy hematology analyzers from a more intuitive workflow with modular reagents to a smaller benchtop footprint and even back-office productivity benefits due to its paper run model, all of which combined to drive greater utilization for customers who upgrade. \n A recent analysis revealed a 20-plus percent uplift in runs per day for customers who upgraded from LaserCyte to ProCyte One with consistent benefits noted across major regions. Upgrades and adoption of new platforms also delivers multiplier benefits to our business, to increase customer loyalty and retention and adoption of other IDEXX in -clinic analyzers. Our continued installed base expansion in our international sector results in another quarter of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. \n Our integrated platform solutions, including benefits from our software ecosystem are well aligned to also support the formation of new practices in regions like the U.S., which continues to contribute net 0.5% to 1% to sector growth. High interest in IDEXX solutions among new practices in the U.S. has become an increasingly important driver of new and competitive placements. Our flexible and customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360 modified to appeal to new practice growth dynamics have attracted strong interest in full point of care suites with high attach rates of catalysts and increased testing across modalities. \n Building on our progress advancing adoption and leverage of IDEXX solutions, we continue to make solid progress advancing our ongoing innovation agenda, including the development of new platforms for diagnostic testing. The first of 2 such new testing platforms currently under development was announced recently at VMX. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, a first of its kind, Slide 3, cellular analyzer platform, is powered by advanced topics and enabled by AI that has been trained by IDEXX's global pathology network. \n Development of this platform is proceeding to schedule and is in its final stages as we plan to begin shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of this year. Our commercial teams have begun educating busy customers on this new piece of technology while also using it to engage with customers on other IDEXX solutions that may be relevant to their practices now. This is another multiplier of new IDEXX innovation, which helps support high reach to revenue metrics in the quarter which reflect the efficacy of our commercial playbook. Early feedback from customers across the globe remains highly positive, building up the enthusiasm experience at both domestic and international veterinary conferences.\n Customers have resonated with both the medical and workflow productivity benefits. Clinicians are well, for example, by the powerful technological innovations that appreciate the clinical need for solutions to ear cytology a daily practice and blood morphology, a critical element of a complete hematology exam. The feedback is consistent across general practices, specialists and corporate accounts who seek cutting-edge tools from IDEXX. We look forward to building on this highly innovative menu by delivering 5 needle aspirate testing that reflect IDEXX's high-performance standards. \n At IDEXX, innovation goes beyond new platforms. Our technology for life approach means that we're constantly assessing our on-market portfolio for opportunities to add value to our products with new insights, greater efficiency or improved easy use. Similar to how blood morphology insights on the IDEXX inVue DX complement our premium hematology analyzers. We recently launched a new generation of our IDEXX VetLab UA platform, which complements inVue DX. \n The new UA Analyzer brings a highly attractive, modernized form factor, is easier to use and features enhanced integrations with IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, saving practice team's time on commonly run urine diagnostics. In the 8 essential urine parameters provided on IDEXX VetLab UA, including PH and protein merged with results from SediVue Dx driving actionable interpretive guidance on next steps that support clinicians to make informed medical decisions. IDEXX reference labs are also benefiting from recent innovations where we see momentum building with the recently launched IDEXX SNAP, a differentiated kidney injury detection test that further bolsters our best-in-class renal health offering for our customers. \n We've now launched in North America, U.K. and Australia and plan to launch in Europe later this year. Experience is growing with its important innovation with almost 500,000 tests ordered by over 13,000 customers since the December launch. Awareness of the test is solid, estimated at just over 50% of U.S. veterinarians based on recent survey work. Significant runway exists to increase awareness and deepen understanding of the clinical utility of this test. \n IDEXX's Software and Imaging business continues to perform well and is addressing significant unmet customer needs. Our cloud-first strategy to building a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem delivers workflow and communication advantages across a clinic that drive productivity while supporting double-digit growth of our profitable SaaS recurring revenue stream for IDEXX. \n Strong software placement growth is now virtually all via cloud-based products. It is supported by customers looking for modern tools to assess diagnostic insights, create and streamline practice workflows and communicate with an increasingly digitally native end customer. By partnering with IDEXX on these solutions, customers are increasingly freed from unrewarded administrative test to pursue their care mission for patients. \n Like our diagnostic platforms and menu, we're also focused on enhancing the IDEXX software ecosystem. Our recent announcement at the Western Veterinary Conference is an example of this, where we were thrilled to announce Vello, our newest Pet Owner Engagement platform, which officially went live in late March. Veterinarians increasingly tell us that their client communication processes and tools are disjointed, high friction and time-consuming. Vello provides veterinarians with a powerful tool that is directly embedded within our IDEXX Practice Management software, supporting streamlined interactions and more efficient workflows. \n The benefits of expanding IDEXX's vertical software suite are many, including deeper customer relationships and improved compliance that helps drive better health outcomes. Vello supports the growth of our profitable recurring software revenues while also delivering multiplier benefits to our Diagnostics business as early Vello adopters are benefiting from fewer customer no-shows and increasing their diagnostic stabilization with IDEXX. \n Another addition to the software ecosystem was the acquisition of GreenLine Pet, a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions, which was completed in the first quarter. The Greenline digital platform enhances IDEXX' partnerships with leading manufacturers in the animal health pharmaceutical and nutrition space, supporting sector development through targeted rebating to customers, made possible through deep integrations with IDEXX and third-party practice management systems. \n By delivering additional relevant solutions to our software customers like Greenline and Vello, we're able to drive strong adoption of our deeply integrated vertical SaaS applications inside of our cloud practice management systems. Providing our customers with a single unified platform for payments, workflow and client communications to name a few applications, helps drive efficiency and remove the need to toggle between multiple applications and manual reconciliations. Not only does this accelerated adoption drive practice productivity, but it also supports greater diagnostics revenue growth and very high retention rates, thereby helping drive our key recurring revenue annuity. \n Overall, we're very proud of how we have advanced our strategic initiatives across multiple business areas in the first quarter, while also delivering an excellent customer experience and strong financial results. I'll now conclude our prepared remarks by thanking the 11,000 IDEXX employees for your ongoing commitment and incredible passion for our purpose-driven work. Your contribution to IDEXX not only helps deliver against our goal of providing a better future for animals, people and our planet, but also help deliver a strong start against our financial objectives in 2024.\n The Companion Animal Diagnostics sector, including supporting software solutions remains highly attractive, and IDEXX teams play a critical role in providing excellent care based on diagnostic insights. As a result, we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long-term horizon. So on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people and livestock. \n Now let's open the line for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: I'm just interested in the comments you made earlier that it seems like you're seeing both maybe some capacity challenges and macro impacting visit trends. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on the latter? It seems like your initial guidance for the year was a bit more optimistic on stabilization of visits. And I'm just wondering if there's any particular, either regions or trends in corporate versus private practice where you're seeing this macro piece more acutely than others? And maybe just linked to that, I know it would be a guess. But as we think about visit erosion right now, what's your best guess in terms of how much of this is just ongoing capacity dynamics at the vet versus what is actually consumer demand at this point? \nBrian McKeon: Thanks for the question, Chris. Maybe I can provide a little clarity on the numbers upfront and then turn it over to Jay to talk about the dynamics. We mentioned that clinical visits were relatively softer than we expected in the U.S. in the first quarter. On our last call, we had talked -- we did anticipate some weather impacts, but I think we were expecting the flattening trends that we've been planning for to emerge. And the trends coming out of the quarter were down about 1.5% versus prior year and so that was relatively softer.\n I would highlight internationally, we had a very good quarter. The underlying volume growth was -- continues to make progress building on what we saw in H2. So this is relatively more of a U.S. specific issue. And we did highlight, I think there are ongoing staffing challenges, capacity challenges that the practices are working through, but there may also be some impact here in the margin related to broader consumer impacts that could be impacting demand. But I'll let Jay talk to those. \nJay Mazelsky: Yes, sure. The way I think about it is both from a customer standpoint, meaning the veterinarian and then the consumer or the pet owner standpoint. And we know that pet owners continue to prioritize spend for healthcare services and general spend on their pets vis-a-vis other priorities, be it building out the dinner, entertainment, travel, that sort of thing. When we -- the conversation we're having with customers is largely very positive. They're very positive on the outlook. They continue to invest in their practices.\n We see that from a technology standpoint, very significant increase we saw in placements of 8%. We're seeing it in software, new practice formation. So I think customers continue to be optimistic on the outlook for the animal health industry as a whole, and this continues to remain both a durable and resilient sector.\n To Brian's point, we do see some ongoing staffing challenges that the practices have been working through. They see IDEXX as a partner from both a technology and solution standpoint and being able to help them. And we also potentially recognize the cumulative macro impacts which may be affecting visit trends at the margin. We have a lot -- from our approach and standpoint and orientation, we really focus on those things that we can control. We have a lot of confidence in the operational execution of our commercial teams and the product development teams from an innovation standpoint. And I think on those dimensions, we're really very positive and hitting on all cylinders. \nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. \nNathan Rich: Great. Can you hear me okay? \nJay Mazelsky: We do. \nNathan Rich: Great. I wanted to follow up on Chris' questions. I guess, you talked about the kind of end of first quarter traffic running a bit below the prior expectations. I guess, would you be able to comment on -- is April kind of in line with that 1.5% decline? And I guess more importantly, as we think about over the balance of the year, it sounds like you expect some improvement in traffic levels.\n I guess just kind of relative degree of confidence in getting back to that. I know you mentioned there's maybe a days effect in there, too, that's a slight benefit. But just curious about where you may be within your different lines of business see that improvement playing out over the balance of the year? \nBrian McKeon: Well, I'll take a moment to just try to help with some of the first half to second half bridging. So you obviously have our Q1 results. And in my comments, I highlighted our expectations around Q2, the organic growth of 6% to 8.5%. \n What we're assuming in the Q2 outlook at midpoint is that we've assumed clinical visit trends similar to what we saw exiting in March. So that's the minus 1.5%. We don't comment on in-quarter trends just highlighting what we're planning in Q2. And if you take the midpoint outlook with our Q1 results, that would apply approximately 7% organic growth in the first half. The second half would imply approximately 9% organic growth.\n We have some positive factors that we highlighted. One is we'll have a half days overall equivalent days benefit largely flowing through in Q3 that we noted. We'll have some select other factors that are favorable to us. We should see better lapping dynamics in areas like LPD. We're targeting higher growth in our software business. So those will be positive as well. And we do have an assumption at midpoint for relatively flattening U.S. clinical visit trends and we see a number of factors that support that assumption that I know Jay can touch on. \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Great. I mean, from our perspective, there's a couple of things that I would highlight. One is that the clinical diagnostics revenue growth rates have continued to remain strong. We saw that in Q1 at 5%, actually higher than total practice revenue growth, which is a little bit over 3%, we continue to see healthy diagnostics frequency and utilization.\n So those metrics continue to remain strong. And it gets back to my earlier message on we see practices continuing to invest. They're investing in technology. They're investing in their staff. We know they're becoming more productive. We think tools like Vello, which is our client engagement software application will be a big help. It integrates very tightly with IDEXX's PIM systems. It enables a reduction in no-shows, which we know is a productivity drag on practices, and we think there will be benefits over time in terms of uplift to diagnostics. So we're doing our part in partnering with clinics, and we think over time, that will play out positively. \nNathan Rich: Great. If I could maybe just ask a quick follow-up on the gross margin strength. Brian, you talked about the factors that were driving this. It sounds like some of those should be sustainable, but I'd be curious to just kind of get your view on that over the balance of the year. And you didn't change the operating margin guidance, I guess, despite the strength that you saw in the first quarter. So any dynamics that we should be thinking about as we think about the cadence over the balance of the year would be helpful? \nBrian McKeon: Sure. To your point, we feel very good about the start that we had in terms of the profit performance and the gross margin performance. We sustained our outlook despite taking down the high end organic growth outlook. So I think that just reflects some of the underlying operational execution benefits that we're getting and our confidence in the ability to deliver solid operating margin gains this year.\n I think there are some select dynamics we noted, instrument costs being lower in Q1. Some of that is sort of an outflow of the pandemic supply chain impacts that have been alleviating. So we saw a relatively more benefit in Q1 than we will expect to see over time through the year. But I think for the most part, the performance is reinforcing the outlook that we had this year for solid comparable operating margin gains and I think reinforces that we can deliver strong financial performance as we work through some of the near-term macro dynamics that we've been highlighting. \nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin: I want to get at the vet visit dynamic in the underlying macro, but I'll try to ask it in a different way. If we take a step back, this really started in 2022, and it was initially seen as a temporary effect of comps and working through that. We're now almost 2.5 years into this, and it continues to sort of lag behind expectations. We're still waiting for this recovery in the vet visits.\n If this -- if current trends persist -- I hear what you're guiding to for second half, and I hear what you're talking about in terms of the improvement, but let's say, trends persist and we still continue to see declines. Can you talk about other levers you could you pull to sort of continue to hit numbers? In prior years, for example, you took price and you took a second price increase once. I know you've got the in-view coming, you've got operating leverage. So just talk us through sort of how you would think if visits remain under pressure, how you would address that? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. I would point to a couple of things. One is, as you highlighted, our innovation agenda, the innovation portfolio we have, I think, is very strong. It consists really across the portfolio. From a point-of-care standpoint, obviously, we plan to begin shipping inVue in Q4. We think that, that has both a direct and indirect leverage impact on the overall business.\n I think our menu offering for the reference lab has never been stronger and growing. We expanded fecal antigen. We know that, that's an important preventive care screening test that really sort of builds out the overall menu [indiscernible] which is acute kidney injury and our overall -- supporting our overall renal franchise menu has been very well received in the overall sector. And then software, which has the twofer of not only being a great individual vertical business, but also the leverage and impact -- positive impact, it has on diagnostics as a whole.\n I think our commercial execution continues to really be at a very high level. We see some benefits internationally where quarter on quarter on quarter, we've really seen some nice growth. I think that the investments we've made have been paying off in individual country and regions. So we saw nice performance in EMEA, for example. And I think it's just continuing to support our customers as they work through the dynamics we've highlighted. And we have confidence really in the attractiveness of the underlying demand that pet owners are generating and what the practices are doing around retaining staff and training them and seeking productivity and we think over time those trends, those clinical visit trends will improve. \nBrian McKeon: And Mike, I'd just reinforce, I think we've consistently demonstrated the ability to grow -- continue to grow solidly and deliver strong financial performance. And so even as we work through kind of the growth off of the higher base that was established post the pandemic and through some of the more recent kind of macro dynamics that we've been highlighting, I think we will continue to find a way to advance our growth agenda, invest behind those things that are important while continuing to deliver strong financial results. So we remain committed to that and we would build a strong track record to support that outlook. \nMichael Ryskin: Okay. But would you consider taking another price increase again or potentially some cost controls in the second half? Is that on the table? \nBrian McKeon: What we -- I think we've laid out our outlook for this year and our assumptions to reinforce, we expect approximately 5% price improvement this year, and that supports the operating margin outlook that we shared today and the strong comparable EPS growth as we invest in advancing our R&D agenda, we highlighted we're investing more there and we're excited about what's going to come. So we're confident in our financial outlook that we shared today. \nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And then just really quick one if I could squeeze in a follow-up. Jay, I think you said in your prepared remarks that the inVue continues to -- inVue remains on track. You talked about it at VMX, obviously. What's been some of that early feedback from vets, I realized you're still maybe 5, 6 months from actually releasing it. But you're 3 months further along than when you first sort of unveiled it. Any learnings in terms of the capabilities ramp? Talk about some of the offering that we'll be able at launch versus later on sort of what's been the reception to that? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. They've been -- customers, in general, have been very enthusiastic about the product itself. They like the fact that it addresses very high-volume, time-consuming critical use cases within the practice, either cytology and blood morphology. One of the things that customers continue to tell us is they know they should be doing more blood morphologies that they're doing just as part of a complete CBC or hematology workup. And now they feel like they're going to be able to do it because it just makes a lot of sense.\n And so they're looking forward to it. And we think the awareness level is increasing and that they see this as really a worthy extension of our overall point-of-care VetLab suite. We're also just -- I would just remind folks that as part of the overall suite, we have a next generation of our VetLab Station, the IVLS station that provides workflow optimization and benefits, and we send that to customers, too, and they're very enthusiastic about that as a whole.\n So really excited. I think that description, as I've laid it out, fits across both journalists within practice specialists, corporate accounts are also enthusiastic about it. I think it gets to some of the questions and the discussion we've had this morning around how do we continue to support the productivity of the practice, which at least addresses the dimension of staff retention and optimization. And I think this fits a bill on both the productivity and capacity front as well as the clinical medical front. \nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. \nErin Wilson Wright: Great. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? Do you think that there's more of an opportunity to see some more meaningful market share gains, either across the smaller practices or corporate accounts as well? And there's clearly been some disruption in terms of ownership structure, in terms of distribution changes and I'm just thinking about how you can kind of take advantage of that? And if you have seen any notable kind of share gains to date? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes, we've always said, and I think it's still true now that the very competitive landscape, I would say that on a global basis, not just in our largest market, the U.S. And the -- what we focus on, obviously, is being able to support our customers, be they independent practices or corporate with a full end-to-end suite at the point of care -- patient reference labs and increasingly software.\n We're pleased with the progress we've made provisionally in terms of advancing the overall solutions. What customers tell us is they like the integrated nature of what we provide. They see that as a differentiator or a set of differentiators relative to our competitors, and that includes being able to take software and tie it all together that supports the workflow as they want to practice within the environment.\n We think that Vello, which is our client engagement application takes that really to the next level in terms of being able to help them digitally communicate indirect with pet owners as a whole. We also are enthusiastic about new practice formation as I've indicated in my remarks where we continue to do well there, new practices, see IDEXX as a partner to be able to help them get those practices off to a strong start, and it's been an area of focus for us.\n So overall, I think our commercial agenda continues to advance nicely. Obviously, we're pretty transparent in terms of placements, new and competitive and how we're doing on that front, both within the U.S. and internationally, and we're doing well. \nErin Wilson Wright: Okay. And then how inVue kind of fits into that strategy as well? I guess initially is the focus on existing customers or swapping out competitor equipment where you have exclusive contracts. Or can you remind us kind of on the timing to of the fine needle aspiration and that seems to be where we're getting some of the earlier feedback and is that sort of 2025? Or how do we think about the time line there? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. So a couple of questions there. The inVue from a focused standpoint, obviously, the IDEXX customers who already enjoy our VetLab suite, our obvious customers from targeting or focus standpoint, we know they'll fit right in with their workflow and already partnership they have with IDEXX.\n We saw that -- by the way, we saw that with SediVue, where the mix of SediVue sales, at least initially were more focused on existing IDEXX customers. So it was a great entree into competitive accounts and opportunity to give us a fresh look, which then we leverage down the road with chemistry and hematology and other solutions.\n In terms of fine needle aspirate, all we've said at this point is it's next. We're working hard at it. We know customers are very enthusiastic about fine needle aspirate and the ability to really expand a set of cancer diagnostics, which is important to their clients and great practice of medicine. And we'll talk more about that as we get closer. \nOperator: We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. \nJonathan Block: I don't think really -- a shocker that I'm also going to try to hit on visits and just sort of need to because your stock is largely tailored to seeming with the data. For visits, you mentioned macro capacity constraints weighing on the overall vet visits. And some of our checks seem to tease out, call it like a higher sensitivity from the pet owner. You're taking price and in many cases that, that might be marking up 2, 3, 4x somewhere in there.\n So I'm just curious, anecdotally, are you identifying more sensitivity on the pet owner sticker shock? Just sort of a broader question. Did this industry overstep a bit on price over the past couple of years? And if so, Brian, do we think about your price getting back to that, I think it's 3% on your LRP, call it sooner rather than later? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. Let me -- Jon, I'll take that. The -- we obviously don't control in pricing to the [indiscernible] that's up to practices and veterinarians. So lot of things factor into that. They're investing in their staff. We think that's a good thing when they retain their staff and really upscale the fellows who are supporting pet owners, that's a long-term driver and a point of stability within practices. And I think coming out of the pandemic, that was a real challenge for them.\n We continue to get back to when we have conversations with practices and customers, they're optimistic. They see some of the challenges around capacity alleviating over time. They continue to invest heavily in the business with technology, we think pricing -- their pricing helps them do that. From our standpoint, we always, from a pricing standpoint, look to maintain a good equilibrium of value for what we deliver. We continue to provide parameters and biomarkers like Cystoisospora, Cystatin B, no additional charge. So those are included in existing panels that obviously help them on the value end of the equation. But we acknowledge that the cumulative macro impacts at the margin may be affecting some pet owners. \nBrian McKeon: Yes. And Jon, just to reinforce Jay's point, I think we align our pricing with the value we were delivering on the underlying inflationary dynamics that we're seeing. And we'll continue to factor that in. And our outlook is consistent with what we shared earlier for 2024, which is approximately 5% net price realization globally. \nJonathan Block: Okay. Sorry about that. And then let me just maybe try to throw a bunch of small ones in the second question. Brian, you talked about the vet visit data to have embedded the midpoint. I've just gotten some questions. Is it as simple as extrapolating out the negative 1.5%, call it, for the lower end, just when we think about your guidance?\n And then you still have this other box coming. I think that's really what can really separate almost a stop from the visit data as people are getting more excited about the premium, right? So just taking a step back, do we think about you guys like handling it in a similar manner?\n Just if I recall last year, I think it was grade out in the investor presentation in August, officially introduced at VMX in January and then hitting the market 9 or 10 months after that in 4Q '24 maybe just at a high level, if you can just talk about from a timing perspective when we think about that second still TBD box that you've alluded to in the past? \nBrian McKeon: Jon, can you just clarify your first question? I just wanted to follow what you were trying to get at when you said -- was it a full year question you're asking? Yes, just trying to clarify what... \nJonathan Block: Yes. Sorry, Brian. Is it just as simple as I think and maybe hopefully, I'm just right, but the midpoint of your guide has visits down 1.5% in 2Q and then essentially flat in 2H. Is it a simple for the lower end, call it, just take that 1.5% and like extrapolate it out for 2H, and that's sort of what's call it embedded in the lower band of your CAG DX recurring. That's where I was sort of going with the first part. \nBrian McKeon: It's obviously a broader set of considerations, but I think directionally, your point is valid, which is -- if trends continue to be softer, that would be a factor that could be leading us towards the lower end. \nJonathan Block: And then on the new box? \nBrian McKeon: Look, I look forward to sharing more. As we get closer to launch, we'll maintain the approach that we've used in the past that -- we'll share that when we we're closer to commercial launch. We're very excited about the inVue advancing and that's on track. And as you know, will contribute directly, and we'll have a lot of multiplier benefits to our business. And I know our sales force is very excited about that, and we are too. And we continue to advance our second platform. And we'll share more on that over time, and we see that as also being an additive driver for our business over time. \nOperator: We'll go next to Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. \nNavann Ty Dietschi: A few followups on vet visits. If you could comment on the U.S. vet industry progress on addressing shortages and mental health of vets and using more vet technicians to assist vets, has this continued? And can you discuss any progress to date? And another follow-up on the macro headwinds on the pet owner side, what are your assumptions for the full year vet visits, wellness and non-wellness, please? \nJay Mazelsky: Yes. From an industry profession side, what customers tell us and what we see is that the staffing churn has largely stabilized. Coming out of the pandemic, I think there was a lot of challenges and the veterinarian pet owners responded by, I think, increasing salary and benefits and cutting back some hours. So those impacts, I think, have largely stabilized. I think practices to the extent that they were able to hire more, have hired more, in some cases, they've instituted training, more internal training programs and have taken those sort of steps. \n They've also, as I mentioned earlier, invested more in technology. I think they're just far more receptive around technology, software, equipment, use of our reference labs that helps them save time. Sometimes it may be 10 minutes, 15 minutes per procedure, but on the other hand, cumulatively, that matters, that I think can be highly worthwhile. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Daniels with William Blair. \nRyan Daniels: Maybe just one quick one in the interest of time. You've talked about the longer-term dynamics of higher diagnostic utilization as pets age through their life cycle. And I know you also have some data about kind of larger than normal pet population growth post the pandemic. So I'm curious if you could give us your thoughts on when we might start seeing the benefits of that flowing through in the industry in regards to diagnostic use? \nJay Mazelsky: What we see is it really increases over time even with the young adult dog. So there's obviously a lot of visits, puppies and kittens. And then as they become young adult cats and dogs that both healthcare services, there's a very modest dip, but generally, healthcare services and diagnostics as both an absolute dollar amount and proportion expands. And then there's -- it grows or accelerates even more quickly as they get into the adult and geriatric stage. \n So our focus has been able to -- is really on accelerating that through all life stages, including young adults or things like wellness testing and exams. But it does go up over time. It's just not linear through the different stages.\n Okay. And with that, we'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for all your questions and for participating this morning. I'll finish today's call by reiterating that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal Healthcare diagnostics utilization.\n IDEXX's organic growth strategy is helping lead the development of our sector, and we look forward to continued high execution against our growth initiatives supported by teams from across the organization. Our growth outlook for 2024 builds off decades of investments in business capabilities that we have made and reflects ongoing sector development and financial results aligned to our long-term framework. And now, we'll end the call. Thank you. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian McKeon",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q1 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. \n In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth and strong profit gains in the first quarter. Overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Solid revenue gains were net of negative growth effects from severe U.S. weather in January which we estimated lowered overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by 0.5% to 1% and added pressure to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels. IDEXX execution trends remained strong, reflected in a continued high IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium, 8% global gains in premium instrument placements and 11% organic gains in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. \n Profit delivery was excellent in the quarter, supported by gross margin gains. Strong operating margin performance enabled EPS delivery of $2.81 per share. EPS was up 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth impact for the lapping of a prior year customer contract resolution payment. \n Overall, we're pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business and delivering strong financial performance as we continue to work through sector and macro factors that have constrained visit growth at veterinary clinics. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends which we estimate will constrain the high end of our full year organic growth outlook this year. \n We've also incorporated updated estimates for foreign exchange effects to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Building on our strong first quarter performance, we're reinforcing our operational EPS outlook at midpoint. This reflects consistent goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement this year and favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. \n First quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by 7% organic CAG gains and 11% organic growth in our Water business, with overall gains moderated by a 3% organic growth decline in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic gains in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 3% organically, building on high prior year placement levels. \n CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q1, supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 6%, with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q1 reflected solid gains across our major regions. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 9% reflecting benefits from net price realization and solid volume gains, building on 2023 second half momentum. International results continue to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong business gains and high premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. \n U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 6.5% in Q1, which reflects a continued significant growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2.3% overall in the quarter, including negative impacts from severe January weather. IDEXX's solid growth results reflect sustained levels of diagnostic frequency and increased diagnostic utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. It also reflects benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and net price realization. \n Excluding estimated weather impacts, U.S. clinical visit growth levels in the first quarter were relatively softer than targeted in our midpoint outlook. These trends reflect ongoing staffing challenges at veterinary clinics and potentially pressure on U.S. consumers from broader cumulative macro impacts. While pet owner demand for health care services remains durable and resilient, and we're confident in IDEXX's ability to execute and drive continued solid organic revenue growth, we believe it's prudent to factor these near-term sector trends into our outlook. This is reflected in adjustments to the high end of our 2024 full year organic revenue growth guidance. \n IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and double-digit organic growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,791 CAG premium instrument placements in Q1, an increase of 8% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. This was supported by strong growth in ProCyte One placements with the global ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 15,000 instruments. \n Global Catalyst placements decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels and shifts in placement mix in the international regions. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 5% organically in Q1 driven by high single-digit gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 6% organically, reflecting similar solid gains in the U.S. and international regions. \n Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 12% as reported, including benefits from our recent software and data platform acquisition, which adds to our software ecosystem. 8% overall organic gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. \n Water revenues increased 11% organically in Q1, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and Europe, including benefits from higher shipment order timing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 3% organically. Solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were moderated by lower Asia Pacific revenues, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing in comparison to higher prior year swine testing levels in China. We expect these negative growth impacts to moderate in the second half of 2024. \n Turning to the P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from business mix, lower instrument costs and software service margin expansion. \n On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year including approximately 6.5% of overall growth impact related to the lapping of a prior $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Q1 OpEx growth was driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. EPS was $2.81 per share in Q1, an increase of 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth rate impact related to the lapping of the prior year customer contract resolution payment. Foreign exchange had a limited impact on gross margin, operating profits and EPS in the quarter, net of a $1 million hedge gain. \n Free cash flow was $168 million in Q1, reflecting normal seasonality. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 92%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. \n Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively in the current interest rate environment. We allocated $155 million in capital to share repurchases in the first quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to prior year levels. \n Turning to 2024 guidance. We've updated our full year P&L outlook to reflect adjustments to the high end of our full year organic growth goals. Our outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense. We've also revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. \n In terms of our revenue outlook, we've updated our full year guidance for reported revenues to $3.895 billion to $3.965 billion, a reduction of $55 million at midpoint. Compared to earlier estimates, our updated reported revenue outlook includes a $35 million or approximately 1% negative growth rate impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've also lowered the high end of our full year organic growth outlook by 1% to capture more recent trends for U.S. clinical visits, which have constrained the organic revenue growth outlook for the first half of 2024. \n Our updated full year guidance for overall organic growth is now 7% to 9%, supported by 7.5% to 9.5% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. For the full year, our outlook for overall organic growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains, supported by IDEXX execution. Our midpoint outlook aligns with expectations of approximately 1.5% declines in U.S. clinic visits in Q2, similar to late Q1 trends. The second half of 2024, our midpoint outlook continues to assume a relative flattening of U.S. clinical visit trends. \n We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results to benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects, reflecting approximately 1% organic growth rate benefits in Q3 with limited overall effects to full year growth. Our full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook reflects consistent expectations for global net price improvement of approximately 5%. \n In terms of our profit guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for reported operating margins of 30.2% to 30.7% for the full year 2024, supported by continued high levels of operating execution. This outlook aligns with 20 to 70 basis points in full year comparable operating margin expansion, net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. \n Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.82 to $11.20 per share is down $0.08 per share at midpoint, driven by our updated foreign exchange estimates. We now estimate foreign exchange will have a negative $0.09 per share full year EPS impact, $0.11 per share unfavorable to prior estimates. Operationally, reductions to the high end of our organic revenue growth guidance are mitigated by our sustained operating margin improvement outlook by approximately $0.06 per share of net favorability from updated net interest expense projections. \n In terms of our outlook for Q2, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% growth headwind from FX. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8.5% and incorporates growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. As noted, at midpoint, the Q2 organic revenue growth outlook aligns with the relatively softer U.S. clinical visit growth trends seen at the end of the first quarter. \n We're planning for reported operating margins of 31.0% to 31.4% in Q2, flat to down moderately on a comparable basis, factoring in projections for relatively higher quarterly R&D spending in support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. \n I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Thanks for the question, Chris. Maybe I can provide a little clarity on the numbers upfront and then turn it over to Jay to talk about the dynamics. We mentioned that clinical visits were relatively softer than we expected in the U.S. in the first quarter. On our last call, we had talked -- we did anticipate some weather impacts, but I think we were expecting the flattening trends that we've been planning for to emerge. And the trends coming out of the quarter were down about 1.5% versus prior year and so that was relatively softer.\n I would highlight internationally, we had a very good quarter. The underlying volume growth was -- continues to make progress building on what we saw in H2. So this is relatively more of a U.S. specific issue. And we did highlight, I think there are ongoing staffing challenges, capacity challenges that the practices are working through, but there may also be some impact here in the margin related to broader consumer impacts that could be impacting demand. But I'll let Jay talk to those. Well, I'll take a moment to just try to help with some of the first half to second half bridging. So you obviously have our Q1 results. And in my comments, I highlighted our expectations around Q2, the organic growth of 6% to 8.5%. \n What we're assuming in the Q2 outlook at midpoint is that we've assumed clinical visit trends similar to what we saw exiting in March. So that's the minus 1.5%. We don't comment on in-quarter trends just highlighting what we're planning in Q2. And if you take the midpoint outlook with our Q1 results, that would apply approximately 7% organic growth in the first half. The second half would imply approximately 9% organic growth.\n We have some positive factors that we highlighted. One is we'll have a half days overall equivalent days benefit largely flowing through in Q3 that we noted. We'll have some select other factors that are favorable to us. We should see better lapping dynamics in areas like LPD. We're targeting higher growth in our software business. So those will be positive as well. And we do have an assumption at midpoint for relatively flattening U.S. clinical visit trends and we see a number of factors that support that assumption that I know Jay can touch on. Sure. To your point, we feel very good about the start that we had in terms of the profit performance and the gross margin performance. We sustained our outlook despite taking down the high end organic growth outlook. So I think that just reflects some of the underlying operational execution benefits that we're getting and our confidence in the ability to deliver solid operating margin gains this year.\n I think there are some select dynamics we noted, instrument costs being lower in Q1. Some of that is sort of an outflow of the pandemic supply chain impacts that have been alleviating. So we saw a relatively more benefit in Q1 than we will expect to see over time through the year. But I think for the most part, the performance is reinforcing the outlook that we had this year for solid comparable operating margin gains and I think reinforces that we can deliver strong financial performance as we work through some of the near-term macro dynamics that we've been highlighting. And Mike, I'd just reinforce, I think we've consistently demonstrated the ability to grow -- continue to grow solidly and deliver strong financial performance. And so even as we work through kind of the growth off of the higher base that was established post the pandemic and through some of the more recent kind of macro dynamics that we've been highlighting, I think we will continue to find a way to advance our growth agenda, invest behind those things that are important while continuing to deliver strong financial results. So we remain committed to that and we would build a strong track record to support that outlook. What we -- I think we've laid out our outlook for this year and our assumptions to reinforce, we expect approximately 5% price improvement this year, and that supports the operating margin outlook that we shared today and the strong comparable EPS growth as we invest in advancing our R&D agenda, we highlighted we're investing more there and we're excited about what's going to come. So we're confident in our financial outlook that we shared today. Yes. And Jon, just to reinforce Jay's point, I think we align our pricing with the value we were delivering on the underlying inflationary dynamics that we're seeing. And we'll continue to factor that in. And our outlook is consistent with what we shared earlier for 2024, which is approximately 5% net price realization globally. Jon, can you just clarify your first question? I just wanted to follow what you were trying to get at when you said -- was it a full year question you're asking? Yes, just trying to clarify what... It's obviously a broader set of considerations, but I think directionally, your point is valid, which is -- if trends continue to be softer, that would be a factor that could be leading us towards the lower end. Look, I look forward to sharing more. As we get closer to launch, we'll maintain the approach that we've used in the past that -- we'll share that when we we're closer to commercial launch. We're very excited about the inVue advancing and that's on track. And as you know, will contribute directly, and we'll have a lot of multiplier benefits to our business. And I know our sales force is very excited about that, and we are too. And we continue to advance our second platform. And we'll share more on that over time, and we see that as also being an additive driver for our business over time."

            "name": "Jay Mazelsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to the year as we continue to advance our strategy to drive the development of the Companion Animal diagnostics sector through innovation and customer engagement. Our ongoing progress benefits from the durable secular growth drivers that have supported the multi-decade expansion of Companion Animal Medical Services. These drivers include growth in the pet population in the strengthened human pet bond as well as the ongoing expansion of pet healthcare services. Medical services is in turn enabled by diagnostics and is a key element of vet clinic growth and profitability. \n IDEXX's business strategy is focused on enabling long-term sector growth by providing unparalleled diagnostic insight through our leading testing and software solutions. This is supported by a robust innovation agenda and a high-touch customer-centered commercial model that helps clinicians test with confidence in an intuitive and efficient way, supporting their mission of delivering high levels of care. \n Our strategy is brought to life by teams across IDEXX, who collectively executed at a high level in the quarter, reflected in continued global expansion of our Diagnostics and Software Solutions and solid growth in recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues once again grew at a healthy premium to the sector, supported by solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization that reflects the increased value that our products and services deliver to our customers. IDEXX commercial teams delivered strong growth in global premium instrument placements, reflecting high interest in adopting IDEXX's point-of-care innovations including expansion of our newest platform solution, ProCyte One. \n Cloud-based software placements once again expanded in the quarter, reflecting vet clinic interest in cloud-native solutions and the IDEXX full stack software suite that continues to advance in scope and functionality. These gains supported double-digit organic growth in recurring software revenues as veterinarians turn to IDEXX to help them grow their practices and drive productivity. As Brian noted, we continue to work through dynamics in terms of staffing challenges and broader pressure on consumers that have impacted clinic visit growth levels. \n Our strong business performance demonstrates our ability to work through these near-term challenges while continuing to expand our business globally to deliver strong financial performance and advance key drivers of our long-term growth strategy and potential. Today, I'll provide an overview of IDEXX's progress against our strategic initiatives during the first quarter. Let's start with an update on our commercial efforts, which are key to driving the adoption and utilization of IDEXX's testing and software solutions. \n IDEXX commercial teams continue to execute at a high level, bringing a customer-first mindset to their work, helping IDEXX's customers to grow faster. Intuitive point of care testing platforms are foundational to this approach. Customer adoption of IDEXX solutions remains high globally, reflected in record first quarter global premium instrument placements for the third consecutive year. This performance, combined with the ability to retain our customers at consistently high levels by delivering an excellent user experience resulted in double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, in total and individually for in-clinic chemistry, premium hematology and urinalysis platforms. This progress is aligned with the approximately 220,000 global placement opportunity we see today for our business. \n A key area of commercial focus is international regions that are at earlier stages of development than the U.S. and provide a relatively more greenfield growth opportunity. Leveraging the successful commercial playbook we have developed from our decades of experience in the U.S., our international sales teams continue to deliver high international installed base growth. Progress on this front is reflected in strong international premium instrument placement gains supported by continued global expansion of our new platform innovations such as ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides significant benefits compared to our legacy hematology analyzers from a more intuitive workflow with modular reagents to a smaller benchtop footprint and even back-office productivity benefits due to its paper run model, all of which combined to drive greater utilization for customers who upgrade. \n A recent analysis revealed a 20-plus percent uplift in runs per day for customers who upgraded from LaserCyte to ProCyte One with consistent benefits noted across major regions. Upgrades and adoption of new platforms also delivers multiplier benefits to our business, to increase customer loyalty and retention and adoption of other IDEXX in -clinic analyzers. Our continued installed base expansion in our international sector results in another quarter of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. \n Our integrated platform solutions, including benefits from our software ecosystem are well aligned to also support the formation of new practices in regions like the U.S., which continues to contribute net 0.5% to 1% to sector growth. High interest in IDEXX solutions among new practices in the U.S. has become an increasingly important driver of new and competitive placements. Our flexible and customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360 modified to appeal to new practice growth dynamics have attracted strong interest in full point of care suites with high attach rates of catalysts and increased testing across modalities. \n Building on our progress advancing adoption and leverage of IDEXX solutions, we continue to make solid progress advancing our ongoing innovation agenda, including the development of new platforms for diagnostic testing. The first of 2 such new testing platforms currently under development was announced recently at VMX. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, a first of its kind, Slide 3, cellular analyzer platform, is powered by advanced topics and enabled by AI that has been trained by IDEXX's global pathology network. \n Development of this platform is proceeding to schedule and is in its final stages as we plan to begin shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of this year. Our commercial teams have begun educating busy customers on this new piece of technology while also using it to engage with customers on other IDEXX solutions that may be relevant to their practices now. This is another multiplier of new IDEXX innovation, which helps support high reach to revenue metrics in the quarter which reflect the efficacy of our commercial playbook. Early feedback from customers across the globe remains highly positive, building up the enthusiasm experience at both domestic and international veterinary conferences.\n Customers have resonated with both the medical and workflow productivity benefits. Clinicians are well, for example, by the powerful technological innovations that appreciate the clinical need for solutions to ear cytology a daily practice and blood morphology, a critical element of a complete hematology exam. The feedback is consistent across general practices, specialists and corporate accounts who seek cutting-edge tools from IDEXX. We look forward to building on this highly innovative menu by delivering 5 needle aspirate testing that reflect IDEXX's high-performance standards. \n At IDEXX, innovation goes beyond new platforms. Our technology for life approach means that we're constantly assessing our on-market portfolio for opportunities to add value to our products with new insights, greater efficiency or improved easy use. Similar to how blood morphology insights on the IDEXX inVue DX complement our premium hematology analyzers. We recently launched a new generation of our IDEXX VetLab UA platform, which complements inVue DX. \n The new UA Analyzer brings a highly attractive, modernized form factor, is easier to use and features enhanced integrations with IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, saving practice team's time on commonly run urine diagnostics. In the 8 essential urine parameters provided on IDEXX VetLab UA, including PH and protein merged with results from SediVue Dx driving actionable interpretive guidance on next steps that support clinicians to make informed medical decisions. IDEXX reference labs are also benefiting from recent innovations where we see momentum building with the recently launched IDEXX SNAP, a differentiated kidney injury detection test that further bolsters our best-in-class renal health offering for our customers. \n We've now launched in North America, U.K. and Australia and plan to launch in Europe later this year. Experience is growing with its important innovation with almost 500,000 tests ordered by over 13,000 customers since the December launch. Awareness of the test is solid, estimated at just over 50% of U.S. veterinarians based on recent survey work. Significant runway exists to increase awareness and deepen understanding of the clinical utility of this test. \n IDEXX's Software and Imaging business continues to perform well and is addressing significant unmet customer needs. Our cloud-first strategy to building a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem delivers workflow and communication advantages across a clinic that drive productivity while supporting double-digit growth of our profitable SaaS recurring revenue stream for IDEXX. \n Strong software placement growth is now virtually all via cloud-based products. It is supported by customers looking for modern tools to assess diagnostic insights, create and streamline practice workflows and communicate with an increasingly digitally native end customer. By partnering with IDEXX on these solutions, customers are increasingly freed from unrewarded administrative test to pursue their care mission for patients. \n Like our diagnostic platforms and menu, we're also focused on enhancing the IDEXX software ecosystem. Our recent announcement at the Western Veterinary Conference is an example of this, where we were thrilled to announce Vello, our newest Pet Owner Engagement platform, which officially went live in late March. Veterinarians increasingly tell us that their client communication processes and tools are disjointed, high friction and time-consuming. Vello provides veterinarians with a powerful tool that is directly embedded within our IDEXX Practice Management software, supporting streamlined interactions and more efficient workflows. \n The benefits of expanding IDEXX's vertical software suite are many, including deeper customer relationships and improved compliance that helps drive better health outcomes. Vello supports the growth of our profitable recurring software revenues while also delivering multiplier benefits to our Diagnostics business as early Vello adopters are benefiting from fewer customer no-shows and increasing their diagnostic stabilization with IDEXX. \n Another addition to the software ecosystem was the acquisition of GreenLine Pet, a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions, which was completed in the first quarter. The Greenline digital platform enhances IDEXX' partnerships with leading manufacturers in the animal health pharmaceutical and nutrition space, supporting sector development through targeted rebating to customers, made possible through deep integrations with IDEXX and third-party practice management systems. \n By delivering additional relevant solutions to our software customers like Greenline and Vello, we're able to drive strong adoption of our deeply integrated vertical SaaS applications inside of our cloud practice management systems. Providing our customers with a single unified platform for payments, workflow and client communications to name a few applications, helps drive efficiency and remove the need to toggle between multiple applications and manual reconciliations. Not only does this accelerated adoption drive practice productivity, but it also supports greater diagnostics revenue growth and very high retention rates, thereby helping drive our key recurring revenue annuity. \n Overall, we're very proud of how we have advanced our strategic initiatives across multiple business areas in the first quarter, while also delivering an excellent customer experience and strong financial results. I'll now conclude our prepared remarks by thanking the 11,000 IDEXX employees for your ongoing commitment and incredible passion for our purpose-driven work. Your contribution to IDEXX not only helps deliver against our goal of providing a better future for animals, people and our planet, but also help deliver a strong start against our financial objectives in 2024.\n The Companion Animal Diagnostics sector, including supporting software solutions remains highly attractive, and IDEXX teams play a critical role in providing excellent care based on diagnostic insights. As a result, we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long-term horizon. So on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people and livestock. \n Now let's open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure. The way I think about it is both from a customer standpoint, meaning the veterinarian and then the consumer or the pet owner standpoint. And we know that pet owners continue to prioritize spend for healthcare services and general spend on their pets vis-a-vis other priorities, be it building out the dinner, entertainment, travel, that sort of thing. When we -- the conversation we're having with customers is largely very positive. They're very positive on the outlook. They continue to invest in their practices.\n We see that from a technology standpoint, very significant increase we saw in placements of 8%. We're seeing it in software, new practice formation. So I think customers continue to be optimistic on the outlook for the animal health industry as a whole, and this continues to remain both a durable and resilient sector.\n To Brian's point, we do see some ongoing staffing challenges that the practices have been working through. They see IDEXX as a partner from both a technology and solution standpoint and being able to help them. And we also potentially recognize the cumulative macro impacts which may be affecting visit trends at the margin. We have a lot -- from our approach and standpoint and orientation, we really focus on those things that we can control. We have a lot of confidence in the operational execution of our commercial teams and the product development teams from an innovation standpoint. And I think on those dimensions, we're really very positive and hitting on all cylinders. We do. Yes. Great. I mean, from our perspective, there's a couple of things that I would highlight. One is that the clinical diagnostics revenue growth rates have continued to remain strong. We saw that in Q1 at 5%, actually higher than total practice revenue growth, which is a little bit over 3%, we continue to see healthy diagnostics frequency and utilization.\n So those metrics continue to remain strong. And it gets back to my earlier message on we see practices continuing to invest. They're investing in technology. They're investing in their staff. We know they're becoming more productive. We think tools like Vello, which is our client engagement software application will be a big help. It integrates very tightly with IDEXX's PIM systems. It enables a reduction in no-shows, which we know is a productivity drag on practices, and we think there will be benefits over time in terms of uplift to diagnostics. So we're doing our part in partnering with clinics, and we think over time, that will play out positively. Yes. I would point to a couple of things. One is, as you highlighted, our innovation agenda, the innovation portfolio we have, I think, is very strong. It consists really across the portfolio. From a point-of-care standpoint, obviously, we plan to begin shipping inVue in Q4. We think that, that has both a direct and indirect leverage impact on the overall business.\n I think our menu offering for the reference lab has never been stronger and growing. We expanded fecal antigen. We know that, that's an important preventive care screening test that really sort of builds out the overall menu [indiscernible] which is acute kidney injury and our overall -- supporting our overall renal franchise menu has been very well received in the overall sector. And then software, which has the twofer of not only being a great individual vertical business, but also the leverage and impact -- positive impact, it has on diagnostics as a whole.\n I think our commercial execution continues to really be at a very high level. We see some benefits internationally where quarter on quarter on quarter, we've really seen some nice growth. I think that the investments we've made have been paying off in individual country and regions. So we saw nice performance in EMEA, for example. And I think it's just continuing to support our customers as they work through the dynamics we've highlighted. And we have confidence really in the attractiveness of the underlying demand that pet owners are generating and what the practices are doing around retaining staff and training them and seeking productivity and we think over time those trends, those clinical visit trends will improve. Yes. They've been -- customers, in general, have been very enthusiastic about the product itself. They like the fact that it addresses very high-volume, time-consuming critical use cases within the practice, either cytology and blood morphology. One of the things that customers continue to tell us is they know they should be doing more blood morphologies that they're doing just as part of a complete CBC or hematology workup. And now they feel like they're going to be able to do it because it just makes a lot of sense.\n And so they're looking forward to it. And we think the awareness level is increasing and that they see this as really a worthy extension of our overall point-of-care VetLab suite. We're also just -- I would just remind folks that as part of the overall suite, we have a next generation of our VetLab Station, the IVLS station that provides workflow optimization and benefits, and we send that to customers, too, and they're very enthusiastic about that as a whole.\n So really excited. I think that description, as I've laid it out, fits across both journalists within practice specialists, corporate accounts are also enthusiastic about it. I think it gets to some of the questions and the discussion we've had this morning around how do we continue to support the productivity of the practice, which at least addresses the dimension of staff retention and optimization. And I think this fits a bill on both the productivity and capacity front as well as the clinical medical front. Yes, we've always said, and I think it's still true now that the very competitive landscape, I would say that on a global basis, not just in our largest market, the U.S. And the -- what we focus on, obviously, is being able to support our customers, be they independent practices or corporate with a full end-to-end suite at the point of care -- patient reference labs and increasingly software.\n We're pleased with the progress we've made provisionally in terms of advancing the overall solutions. What customers tell us is they like the integrated nature of what we provide. They see that as a differentiator or a set of differentiators relative to our competitors, and that includes being able to take software and tie it all together that supports the workflow as they want to practice within the environment.\n We think that Vello, which is our client engagement application takes that really to the next level in terms of being able to help them digitally communicate indirect with pet owners as a whole. We also are enthusiastic about new practice formation as I've indicated in my remarks where we continue to do well there, new practices, see IDEXX as a partner to be able to help them get those practices off to a strong start, and it's been an area of focus for us.\n So overall, I think our commercial agenda continues to advance nicely. Obviously, we're pretty transparent in terms of placements, new and competitive and how we're doing on that front, both within the U.S. and internationally, and we're doing well. Yes. So a couple of questions there. The inVue from a focused standpoint, obviously, the IDEXX customers who already enjoy our VetLab suite, our obvious customers from targeting or focus standpoint, we know they'll fit right in with their workflow and already partnership they have with IDEXX.\n We saw that -- by the way, we saw that with SediVue, where the mix of SediVue sales, at least initially were more focused on existing IDEXX customers. So it was a great entree into competitive accounts and opportunity to give us a fresh look, which then we leverage down the road with chemistry and hematology and other solutions.\n In terms of fine needle aspirate, all we've said at this point is it's next. We're working hard at it. We know customers are very enthusiastic about fine needle aspirate and the ability to really expand a set of cancer diagnostics, which is important to their clients and great practice of medicine. And we'll talk more about that as we get closer. Yes. Let me -- Jon, I'll take that. The -- we obviously don't control in pricing to the [indiscernible] that's up to practices and veterinarians. So lot of things factor into that. They're investing in their staff. We think that's a good thing when they retain their staff and really upscale the fellows who are supporting pet owners, that's a long-term driver and a point of stability within practices. And I think coming out of the pandemic, that was a real challenge for them.\n We continue to get back to when we have conversations with practices and customers, they're optimistic. They see some of the challenges around capacity alleviating over time. They continue to invest heavily in the business with technology, we think pricing -- their pricing helps them do that. From our standpoint, we always, from a pricing standpoint, look to maintain a good equilibrium of value for what we deliver. We continue to provide parameters and biomarkers like Cystoisospora, Cystatin B, no additional charge. So those are included in existing panels that obviously help them on the value end of the equation. But we acknowledge that the cumulative macro impacts at the margin may be affecting some pet owners. Yes. From an industry profession side, what customers tell us and what we see is that the staffing churn has largely stabilized. Coming out of the pandemic, I think there was a lot of challenges and the veterinarian pet owners responded by, I think, increasing salary and benefits and cutting back some hours. So those impacts, I think, have largely stabilized. I think practices to the extent that they were able to hire more, have hired more, in some cases, they've instituted training, more internal training programs and have taken those sort of steps. \n They've also, as I mentioned earlier, invested more in technology. I think they're just far more receptive around technology, software, equipment, use of our reference labs that helps them save time. Sometimes it may be 10 minutes, 15 minutes per procedure, but on the other hand, cumulatively, that matters, that I think can be highly worthwhile. What we see is it really increases over time even with the young adult dog. So there's obviously a lot of visits, puppies and kittens. And then as they become young adult cats and dogs that both healthcare services, there's a very modest dip, but generally, healthcare services and diagnostics as both an absolute dollar amount and proportion expands. And then there's -- it grows or accelerates even more quickly as they get into the adult and geriatric stage. \n So our focus has been able to -- is really on accelerating that through all life stages, including young adults or things like wellness testing and exams. But it does go up over time. It's just not linear through the different stages.\n Okay. And with that, we'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for all your questions and for participating this morning. I'll finish today's call by reiterating that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal Healthcare diagnostics utilization.\n IDEXX's organic growth strategy is helping lead the development of our sector, and we look forward to continued high execution against our growth initiatives supported by teams from across the organization. Our growth outlook for 2024 builds off decades of investments in business capabilities that we have made and reflects ongoing sector development and financial results aligned to our long-term framework. And now, we'll end the call. Thank you."
