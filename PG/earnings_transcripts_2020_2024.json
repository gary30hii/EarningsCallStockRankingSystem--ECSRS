        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, joining me this morning.  We're back in our offices in Cincinnati with our masks, appropriately distanced. We'd like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are also safe and are well. I'm going to provide an overview of company results, which continue to be strong. David will cast additional light on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2021, and of course, take your questions.  Fiscal 2020 was a very strong year. We grew markets and increased household penetration, driving top line growth, bottom line growth as well as market share. It's what we call balanced growth and value creation. Organic sales grew 6%. On a 2-year stack basis, organic sales growth has accelerated from 3% across fiscals '17 and '18 to 6% across fiscal '18 and '19 to 11% over the last 2 years, indicating the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of our strategy, which is driving our business.  We built strong momentum in 1.5 years leading up to the COVID crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019, including 6% in the first half of fiscal 2020. We maintained the strong momentum in the second half of fiscal 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories, significantly increased production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs.  David talked at CAGNY 4 years ago about accelerating growth in our 2 largest and most profitable markets. Fiscal year 2020, U.S. organic sales grew 10%, including 5% growth in the first half of the fiscal. China grew 8%, including 13% organic growth in the first half of the year. 9 of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care and Personal Health Care, up in the teens; Family Care, up double digits; Fabric Care and Feminine Care, up high singles. Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Oral Care, up mid-singles. Grooming, up 1. Baby, down 1. 30 of our top 50 country category combinations held or grew share.  E-commerce sales were up 40% for the year, up 30% in the first half and 50% in the second half, now over $7 billion in sales, over 10% of the company total. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were up 13%. Currency-neutral core earnings per share up 17%. Within this, core gross margin expanded 170 basis points, up 190 basis points constant FX. Core operating margin grew 180 basis points, up 210 basis points, excluding currency impacts.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 114%. We increased our dividend 6% and returned $15.2 billion of value to share owners, $7.8 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase. Capping a strong year, a very strong April-June quarter. Organic sales up more than 6% on top of a base period that was up 7%. Volume, pricing and mix, each contributed to top line growth. Strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets, up 19% in the U.S. and 14% in Greater China. Strong market share trends, with aggregate global value share up 50 basis points. At the bottom line, core earnings per share of $1.16, up 5% versus the prior year, up 11% on a currency-neutral basis, including a 7 point headwind from gains on land and small brand sales in the base period. Core gross margin, up 210 basis points, up 250 ex FX. Core operating margin, up 140 basis points, up 190 ex FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 161%.  Coming up, we delivered or overdelivered on each of our going end targets for the year: organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to share owners. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and arguably built this further during the challenging second half of the year. I know I speak for David and the rest of our leadership team when I say that credit for these results goes to our colleagues. The men and women of P&G, who have demonstrated incredible creativity, agility and commitment to serving consumers and customers every day during these unprecedented times.  We will continue to face significant challenges and perhaps a higher degree of uncertainty than any of us have ever faced. But we believe that current consumer dynamics are integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies and our focus on a few immediate priorities position us very well for the future. David?\nDavid Taylor: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is well. As we outlined last quarter, we've established 3 immediate priorities that guide our actions and our choices in this crisis period. Our first priority is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. With guidance from medical professionals, we're constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making, packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand.  This leads to the second priority: maximizing the availability of products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. These products are more important than ever given the needs created by the current crisis. There's an increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time we're all spending at home.  Third priority is supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure families have basic access to everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We're providing significant financial support to numerous relief agencies around the world. We're producing hand sanitizer, face mask and face shields in P&G facilities for our internal use and also for donation to organizations in great need.  Finally, we're using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. And P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of the employees -- of our employees, maximize the availability of P&G products to serve consumers and help society overcome the challenges in this period.  Our integrated strategic choices remain the right ones. They serve each of our immediate priorities and that the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We're focused on portfolio of daily-use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.  Within these categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. The most sustainable and profitable way to grow is to create new business versus just taking or trading it. Superior offerings, science-based products delivered to a superior packaging drive market growth, which in turn drives share, sales and profit growth. This creates a winning proposition for all concerned, high expansion versus 0 sum. It's the only growth our retailers care about. Growth that is incremental to the category. And if we lead category growth with superior offerings, we will mathematically build market share.  We strive to communicate product and packaging benefits with superior brand messaging. P&G was just named the #1 brand marketer of the decade at the Cannes Lions Festival Creativity in June. Not only has our advertising been creative, it's been increasingly effective at growing markets and building our business. I'm particularly proud of this as it speaks to sustained excellence versus a few great ads.  In addition to winning with consumers' communication, we need superior retail execution, online and in physical stores that contributes to the growth of categories and our brands. Our superior performance in this area has been recognized in third-party surveys of retailers and awards from top customers that we've been mentioned previously. Most recently, Target recognized P&G as supplier of the year across all our product categories in the store. We appreciate the recognitions we've received, but really matters is retailers' improved view of P&G as a partner and joint value creation, helping retailers grow categories and create value on strong distribution, share of shelf, display and feature.  The fifth vector of superiority is value for consumers and for customers. In performance-driven categories, consumers often see the value in paying a modest premium for noticeably better product performance. We're strengthening our innovation across price tiers with the aim of delivering superior value at each price tier where we compete. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world.  The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business, delivering strong cost and cash productivity. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future.  In this environment, agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both producing and helping more? What new needs must be met and in what new ways? We're fostering an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility.  Our new organization structure, 6 industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focused markets and enterprise markets and very small corporate groups with best-in-class functional expertise is also serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  These strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend the superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organizational focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow share, sales and profit. Some examples. Global Home Care improved its noticeable superiority from less than 60% in fiscal '18 to nearly 80% superiority this fiscal year. We invested in product performance, in packaging in each of the subcategories: hand dish, auto dish, dish care and surface care, including launching our new Microban 24 surface standardization product in February.  We step-changed consumer communication, leveraging educational TV advertising, which delivered an immediate lift to the category and our brands by showing consumers more ways to use our products. We elevated in-store execution with additional navigational and educational signage to help the consumer choose the product that is right for them. These superiority investments have yielded strong results. And most importantly, they've grown markets, both before and after the pandemic. P&G Home Care has driven over 60% of the global category market growth and accelerated organic sales growth from low single digits to double digits, increased profit, improved market share 1.5 points and increased household penetration, all in the last 2 years. The business grew organic sales 7% in fiscal '19, 7% in the first half of fiscal '20 ahead of the crisis. We had great momentum that only accelerated in the second half of the year with nearly 25% organic growth. China fem care has been driving category growth through superior innovation and demand creation. Innovation is focused on organics, overnight protection and teens. The Whisper brand has driven 25% of category growth, well above its 12% market share. The brand has grown market share over 2 points over the last 3 years and grown organic sales at an average rate in the high teens over this period. One more, P&G U.S. Personal Home Care -- Health Care, rather, has focused on improving the superiority across all 5 vectors, reaching over 80% superiority across the portfolio this year.  P&G brands drove more than 25% of category growth this past year, roughly double their market share weight. Vicks, Metamucil, Pepto-Bismol, Prilosec, Align and ZzzQuil each grew share over the past 3, 6 and 12-month periods, with total U.S. P&G Personal Health Care value share of 1 point or more over these time periods. U.S. Personal Health Care delivered its fourth consecutive year of organic sales growth with high single-digit growth in fiscal '19 and double-digit growth in fiscal '20. We think our strategies, the success we've had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and a clean home all bode well for the future. The relevance of our categories and consumers' lives has increased. There may be a long-term increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. Organizational agility, high employee engagement, to meet the changing needs of consumers and retailers likely becomes more important. We believe P&G is well positioned to serve consumers' heightened needs and their changing behaviors and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value creation. I'll turn it back over to John to cover the outlook for fiscal 2021.\nJon Moeller: To underscore David's comments, we like our long-term prospects, rooted in service of consumers with increasing needs. The near term, though, will be challenging and is more difficult to predict. Our outlook starts with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. We'll likely be operating without a vaccine or advanced therapeutics through fiscal '21. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world.  In the U.S., it's unclear how long we'll be operating at double-digit unemployment levels and how long there will be mitigating economic stimulus available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics result in an increased cost to operate. There's also a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers being shut down due to local mandates.  Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. We're targeting organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year and markets where growth could range from flat to around 3% value growth.  We're targeting core earnings per share growth of 3% to 7% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. The bottom line outlook reflects the full range of potential top line outcomes. It also incorporates $300 million after-tax of foreign exchange headwinds, largely offset by $275 million after-tax and commodity cost tailwinds. This outlook also includes a $150 million after-tax headwind from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income.  If you consider the quarterly cadence of the year, base period comps will play a significant role in top line trends. Organic sales growth should be stronger in the first half of the year and moderate in the second half as we annualize the recent acceleration in category growth. Bottom line growth should be somewhat stronger in the second half due mainly to higher cost productivity as the year progresses.  Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to share owners. We're targeting another year of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.  Now I'll hand it back quickly to David for closing comments.\nDavid Taylor: We delivered a very strong fiscal 2020, meeting or beating each of the key goals we set out at the start of the year in a challenging and volatile market. We believe we have a bright future ahead. We have the right strategies, portfolio and daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority and products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organizational focus, agility and accountability. We feel we have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the company is facing, ensuring the health -- employee health and safety, maximizing product availability and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and communities. We're investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization.  We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest, in the interest of our long-term share owners with an eye fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation.  With that, we would be happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: My question has to do with the enterprise market, both from a short-term perspective and, I guess, a longer-term, more strategic perspective. In the short term, are you seeing any of the challenges that the pandemic have sort of placed in those markets in particular, showing any signs of improvement? Are the challenges alleviating? And then longer term, kind of given where things stand, are you thinking any differently about any of those markets? Are you deciding to -- sure, the tailwind is maybe more negative than I mean, but change your investment philosophy with regard to any of those markets.\nDavid Taylor: Wendy, I'll make one comment, then I want to turn it to Jon because he has direct responsibility for the enterprise markets. The comment I'd make is the organizational structure change we made has really helped us deal with this recent pandemic. We grew in enterprise markets where they're facing just a range, as you know, of very big challenges. But if anything, it's reinforced the strength of the organization of choice and actually the possibilities we see for the future. I want to turn it to Jon to talk how we're dealing with it directly. But no, we haven't changed our long-term view on the attractiveness of the enterprise markets.\nJon Moeller: And I'm going to take one step to the side, and then I'll come hopefully back to the middle here. Remember that the whole -- from an organization structure context, one of the driving forces and the design was to free up category leaders and sector CEOs to focus on the biggest opportunities, which were the focus markets where we generate 80% of our sales and 90% of our profit. And I, of course, don't want to assert direct causality, but there's nothing to indicate that isn't exactly what's happening. So in the U.S., we grew, as we've said earlier, 10% over the year, 19% in the last quarter. In China, we grew 8% over the year, 14% in the last quarter. Those are our 2 largest focus markets. So that part of the organization strategy is working well. We also wanted to move decision-making in enterprise markets closer to consumers, competitors, customers, with the hope that we would continue to provide strong growth in those markets, both on a top and bottom line standpoint, and that continues to be the case. We grew despite all the difficulty of the last year, 3% organically on the top line. We grew 16% on the bottom line. We exited the year with only 2 of the enterprise markets. That's over 100 countries, losing money, which is unprecedented for us. And we did that, we built that profitability despite significant headwinds and while growing market share. In aggregate, the enterprise markets were up 0.2 points. But we're happy with all of that. Now to get back to the middle and answer to your questions more directly. Yes, we're facing challenges in the enterprise market as a result of the current both health and economic crisis. And yes, it is affecting market sizes negatively. And no, that's not over and arguably continues to worsen.  In terms of our long-term view on these markets, they're an incredibly important piece of the company. We generated in enterprise markets, I think we crossed $14 billion in sales this year, $1.6 billion in aftertax profit. So they're meaningful and can create value. We want to be more consistent in our efforts to do that. So we have made changes to our business models, to our cost structures, to ensure that as we grow in these markets, we can do that profitably. But we remain committed to success in these markets and highly confident we can deliver that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Congratulations on a great year. A question for David. Just on organizational priorities and how these may have shifted as a result of the pandemic. So no shortage of discussion, of course, in the marketplace around this accelerated channel shift online, more time spent working from home, which seems like it will be lasting certainly to some degree. Much bigger focus on health and wellness, broader emphasis on ESG, just to name a few. So David, could you discuss some of these bigger trends that you see as more lasting versus those that are more transitory? And perhaps how your priority and the organization's priorities may have shifted over the past 6 to 12 months in light of these consumer shifts?\nDavid Taylor: Certainly. All good questions -- many questions there. First, the -- if I look at what's happened for the last couple of years, if anything, it's just reinforced the set of choices that we've made. What we are seeing and the pandemic's, frankly, accelerated is consumers are right now moving more and more back to trusted brands. The pandemic has actually put many, many more people back in their homes. And if you think about health, hygiene and cleaning categories, and we said it a lot, and sometimes I think people get tired of it, but it's categories where performance drives brand choice really matters. And I think it matters even more now.  We were seeing that before the pandemic because we grew very, very well in the first half of the year, 6%, and we saw it through the pandemic. But those -- that focus on health, hygiene and cleaning and are having things that really matter. And one of the other points that I think in the strategy that's really working and it fits what's going on right now is because of the shift to e-commerce, there's tremendous pressure on retailers, and frankly, all participants on profitability. So if your strategy is one where innovation grows the category size, when you do that, you create the larger pie, which allows both the retailer to increase their profitability, to manufacture, and it doesn't put the rest of the industry in a bad place. It's actually in a better place. So to me, I believe the strategy is actually moving in the right place.  You mentioned ESG, I think it's another area where P&G has particular strengths. Well before it was in vogue, P&G has always had a position of being a very strong corporate citizen. We have stood up in both social sustainability and environmental sustainability with sustained efforts in those areas. It's the way we operate. It's consistent with our values. And so as there's been a greater focus on that, I think that as well matters because consumers more and more, as well as all stakeholders, one on the values of the company is behind the brand. And I think that also plays well to the strategy. What I feel one of the things best about is we have not had to make big shifts in our strategy as a result of what's happened. It's just reinforced the importance of it.  And the final point I'd make is the organizational changes that we made, which are putting more accountability closer to where our consumers or customers are and recognizing the inherent strength of our people and capability of the organization in unleashing it to me has shown sequentially stronger and stronger results and better and better activation of that strategy. And you saw it going into the crisis because, again, the crisis accelerated trends that were happening and our people stepped up magnificently well and beyond trying to deliver the business. They initiated many of these projects to, can we make mask and donate them? Can we make hand sanitizers and donate some of those? Face shields, we've never made. But a group -- 2 different groups decided they could repurpose some of our packaging equipment and turn that packaging equipment into something that can make face shields, and we've shipped hundreds of thousands of face shields to the medical community. But it just shows you that when you have engaged people that care about both the consumers and the communities, what they can do. So it's just we accelerated the choices we've made. And Kevin, I think it's put us in a very good position coming out of the pandemic because of the capabilities we've been developing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: One thing I wanted to ask about was the productivity. So beyond the 6% organic sales growth this quarter, the productivity was really remarkable, the 440 basis points in total between cost of goods and SG&A. And that was on a very strong comparison and more than double, I think, the run rate through the fiscal year-to-date. So maybe anything about what's been done kind of differently. I know productivity is typically strongest in the fourth quarter. But as you carry forward into '21 and beyond, are there things that you've been able to do differently, cost-savings opportunities, productivity opportunities that kind of presented themselves given the change in the environment? So we can be a bit informed in terms of that productivity going forward.\nDavid Taylor: I'll make one comment, again, I'll turn it to Jon on this one. We've talked a great deal about the fact that all buckets, all spin pools have been looked at and we've leveraged to me both the digital ecosystem as well as the capabilities of our organization to make substantive changes. And one of the best illustrations of that is what happened when the pandemic hit, we started to see both attendance issues and supply challenges. We've learned time and time again that when we ask groups of people to step up and address change, they can do it incredibly well. We've had plants that have operated at 90% of their effectiveness with half the people in the short run, demonstrating again there's more there. But I'll turn it to Jon to get the specifics, but both the gross margin and operating margin to meet progress has been sustained over the last several years. And if you look forward, we see still tremendous amount in both media. We see with many of our nonconsumer-facing spending areas as well as cost of goods. Jon?\nJon Moeller: Just two comments. One, I'm glad you realize, and I know you always have, that the productivity savings do accrue more to the back half of the year than the front half of the year because that's going to be important as you think about your quarterly cadence for estimates next year because the same thing, the same pattern will hold true. We have learned a ton, as David was indicating, as a result of the experience we've been through the last 4 months. And one of the things I believe we've learned is that there is even more opportunity than we thought. I'll just give you one simple and obvious example, travel and entertainment. We never really -- I don't think could have imagined that we'd be accomplishing all we are with effectively 0 travel and entertainment. And that's not the right long-term answer. But the right long-term answer is not what we were doing previously. We've all become much more effective working in very different ways with digital tools, as David indicated. I think the general comfort with digital tools that are available to us makes it much more likely that we will seek those tools out in terms of improving our work efficiency and effectiveness across all of our activity systems. So there is -- David mentioned the manufacturing efficiency, which is clearly an opportunity as well. So we continue to be committed to productivity as a fundamental foundation stone in our strategy. It enables the investment in superiority, which grows markets and then flows through the income statement.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: So we've heard a lot of CPG companies, particularly across food and beverages, but I think across the board, take this moment to or aggressively simplified base-level assortments to maximize merchant availability and maximize turns. I guess, can you talk about what steps you've taken to do likewise? And also at what pace you expect there -- you to be layering in a bit more variation, those things, hopefully, you catch up to supply constraints and things start to normalize? And I guess the real question is, when you do start to layer in more variation, would you expect that to take more of the form of you bringing back some of the things that you most recently cut out? Or is this an opportunity to redirect innovation and branding resources in new directions to best drive market growth in the future?\nDavid Taylor: Again, several questions. First, when the pandemic hit, yes, in some categories, we went to more simplified SKU lineups in order to maximize the capacity of the high turn items. And I'm sure we and many others did that. And we learned through that as well. In some cases, where there were some smaller volume SKUs that meet special consumer needs, and they will come back. There's also some opportunities for some continued SKU rationalization to better serve consumers and meet the retailers' needs. So both of those are happening. It's very category specific on what we're doing. But I'd say, in general, there's a sharper look at can we have a more focused portfolio with really differentiated products. So I think, yes, that will continue.  The change in manufacturing to me, in order to adjust the agility needed, I think is one of the other things that's really been an area that we're working before, but coming into the crisis and then through it. Looking at business continuity plans, the total supply system, look at the appropriate number of suppliers in order to ensure you have the agility to react to instantaneous capacity swings that we're seeing. I think there's all been learning in those areas. I expect on the other side of this, again, varying by category, but there will be some streamlining in order to meet the needs. And in some of the categories, because there will be a sustained increase in consumption, we're looking at what we need to do to ensure we have the right capacity to meet those needs. Because I think a lot of the spike that we've seen is not going to go away in some of these categories. Consumers are developing new habits. And I think many of us believe that will last well beyond the pandemic.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Another quarter with very strong market share momentum. Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of competitive response from key competitors on either the ad spend from a promotion front more towards the end of fiscal Q4 or so far in July? And how do you ensure that P&G's market share momentum continues going forward, if you do experience greater competitive intensity as competitors are likely to sit still here with share losses? And also, Jon, you touched on products, consumer trade down and private label share pressure potentially in this macro environment a few months ago on the Q3 call. Maybe just give us an update on where we stand today versus your viewpoint a few months back?\nDavid Taylor: Yes. First, on the market trends, our market share, global market share has actually strengthened through the year. We were up 0.3 for the total year, 0.4 for 6 months, 0.5 for the past 3. In terms of the last quarter, in terms of promotion intensity activity, as you would imagine, in categories where there's supply constraints, you'd see less promotion as everybody focuses on meeting the basic supply needs of the customers and the consumers. And on the categories of tissue/towel, which is our Family Care, Home Care, which will just surface and air, that's largely continued into this fiscal year as the demand hasn't ceased. And if you take the U.S., it's our largest market we wanted to focus on. As you know, when you watch the daily news and you hit the daily news, there's just a lot of debate on how much it will open up or even stop or even go back.  So I think the focus on Home, Personal Care, cleaning and hygiene is likely to sustain itself. And so I don't expect in the short run dramatic changes in the promotion environment, although, again, it's very category specific, and in many cases, very country specific. We've chosen to stay extraordinarily focused on the strategy, which is focused on investing in the superiority across the 5 elements we've talked. And through this last couple of years, that's consistently worked in both high promotion environments, which we see in some countries and categories, and in this last 3 to 4 months when there was lower promotion because of supply constraints. And as I think about next year, there will be, I'm sure, competitors will come in and they'll have innovation and there'll be changes in their promotion strategy. But we've tried not to get distracted from the strategy that's working and, again, across the balance of countries and categories, that continues to work, and I think it will. Jon?\nJon Moeller: On consumer trade-down, as we've talked before, we're not immune to that, and that could become an increasing dynamic going forward to the extent unemployment grows and stimulus and support shrinks. But as we've also talked, we're in a much better position to deal with that than we have been historically. And I think the environment actually helps us as well. So let me quickly unpack that. We have focused our portfolio, as we've talked several times over in this call, in categories where performance drives brand choice. By definition then, a portion of the value equation is performance. And to the extent that we have an advantage in performance, that's noticeably -- that's noticeable and obvious. That, along with a fair price, albeit a small premium, is viewed as offering value. And we have a much higher percentage of our portfolio that's well positioned in that context than as we headed into the last recession. And the needs for performance, so the degree to which performance affects our consumer's personal value equation, vis-\u00e0-vis, price is higher than it's ever been, which also works in our favor. The -- to date, this can change, obviously. But to date, if you look at private label market shares as one proxy of trade down, we're not seeing it. Private label shares in aggregate across our categories in the U.S. were down 40 basis points in the last 3 months. They were essentially flat in Europe. Last point, we have significantly built out, not always perfectly, but we've built out our pricing ladders. We didn't have items like Tide simply available for consumers in the last recession, and we have many more of those currently. So again, we're not immune. It's real. The best way to attack it is with performance, noticeably superior performance at a fair value to have the right pack sizes available for consumers who are limited in terms of their cash outlay and double down on the strategy that's working versus stepping back.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Jon, I was hoping you can just give us some more context on the guidance for next year on the top line just from a geographic perspective, just so we can understand kind of how you're thinking about the enterprise markets versus some of the focus markets and then thinking about developed Europe. That would be super helpful.\nJon Moeller: So the first piece of context I'd provide on the top line guidance for next year, because I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's all based on what we're expecting on market growth, and then we would expect to grow slightly ahead of that and continue building share. And as I mentioned, we see markets growing modestly, probably 1% to 3%. And so the 2% to 4% range is consistent with building share in that environment. If we look at our own forecast, Nick, for top line growth in enterprise versus the balance of the market, they're both within that range. So we're going to continue to expect not only total company growth, but both focus on enterprise market growth on both the top and bottom line. Clearly, in the current context, so let's just use that as a proxy for the future, we're seeing very strong growth in U.S. and China, as we've talked. If you look at the quarter, growth in Europe was much more modest, but that has picked up recently. And clearly, while we expect growth from the enterprise markets, they're currently the most challenged just in terms of the operating environment and the economic -- both economic and health pressures that families are feeling.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: You guys have clearly demonstrated better execution. Obviously, sales or competition. So just a few questions about how you think about continuing to drive that growth. Does more to come from continuing to grow into areas that have been disproportionately grown already? Or is it more around turning around underperformers? Or do you expect, so for example Baby Care, what -- can you talk about what you're doing there to turn around that performance? Maybe if you could talk about the innovation pipeline, since obviously, SK-II is going to be a bit challenging in the near term. And then how much of this -- you obviously talked about private label coming down. So how much of this is coming from established players versus the long tail of sort of newest brands potentially fading away?\nDavid Taylor: Olivia, first, just the last thing you said, whether most of this coming from the established brands or long tail, our core is going very well. Fabric care is growing. Fabric, tissue/towel, Home Care, Health Care, all going very well. Our Beauty business grew very well last year. Skin Care, Personal Care, APDO, antiperspirant and deodorant, all that grew well. So the core grew well, and again, it's central to the strategy, and it's obviously the biggest part of the business. And the 2 biggest markets grew were U.S. and China. If I look forward, in order for us to be a dependable long-term grower, we have to grow the core. And the strategy is focused on making sure the core is healthy. And the core has to continue to extend to address new benefits that are relevant in those categories. And there's many, many examples we've given in the past of that, and certainly, we get more of the Home Care examples that you see out with Microban and many of the other things that occurred on Mr. Clean brand and Febreze brands over time. We also believe in RC and certainly, some of the additional investments we've made are paying out, both internally developed innovation as well as some of the acquired innovation. Our track record is getting increasingly better on those as well. And this year, we have certainly some things coming out of our P&G venture. But that's a small portion of the total company. But what it does speak to is innovation is driven core, core and more and then in new benefit spaces, new jobs that we can do.  To me, it speaks to just the whole innovation process is working in the company. But I fully expect for the year that we're going into right now and the next several years, the core will be the biggest driver of that. And there's still significant opportunities. So what I wouldn't think is we're in mature categories. 4 years ago, people said we are mature categories. And now you see big established businesses and take Fabric & Home Care, that it have moved from low single digits to mid-single digits to high single digits in many, many countries. And if you get down to the next level and look at household penetration by item, and what you see is many of them are in the 10% to 30% range and 10% to 30%, which means the majority of consumers haven't used the product in the last year and haven't experienced the new benefit of the improved performance that we've built. So -- and we've gone back to rediscover the opportunity to build household penetration, new users, grow the market size, leverage superiority to bring their users in and then leverage additional benefits to trade people up to higher order performance. That's happened across the 10 core categories. And then when you do it well, you grow share. And probably the best example I gave earlier was in Personal Health Care where virtually every brand grew share over 3, 6 and 12 months. And it's because of new innovation that they bought to the market. It's delighting the consumers. So core, core and more and then our venture effort to me is it's now producing new brands with Zevo, an update coming out this year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. I'd like to drill down on the U.S. e-commerce business. And if you could address three aspects. One, can you give a rough sense of the kind of growth and growth momentum in the business, kind of March to June? What percent of sales? And how sticky this is looking at? And then in response to that, what are the sort of changes that you are doing organizationally, either with the sales force or the supply chain, to meet the increased demand for e-commerce as a channel? And then finally, how do you assess your competitive advantage in e-commerce versus brick and mortar?\nDavid Taylor: We'll take a cut at some of those. I'm not sure I have all the specifics. Although some of those, we can certainly get you afterwards. The e-commerce business has been growing for now several years in the 30% to 40% range. As you know, we're most developed in China. The U.S. is also growing extremely fast, and we expect it to continue. We've adjusted -- and again, it fits with the strategy. We've adjusted our supply chain, including our packaging capability, to be able to meet the needs of e-commerce, consumers and e-commerce aggregators that had different needs because of the -- instead of shipping it in a case in a pilot load to a store. It's in each going through a different path to the consumer, and that's worked well. One of the things we've worked very hard on and is present today is we want e-commerce shares growing in absolute, and we want e-commerce shares to be equal or higher than their off-line shares, and we're working to have the same profitability. And we've made very good progress on both of those as well in the U.S. and China and in Europe. And that will continue to be a priority. We want to be agnostic to where the consumers buy the product. In the most recent period, the U.S. e-commerce business that was up 50% in fiscal '20, we all know there's a spike driven by COVID. How much of that will sustain? We'll see. But I think many are developing new habits. So I think we are prepared for that to continue to grow at that pace and meet the consumers' needs and we've developed. The last point I'd make, additional capability because we've worked with many of the e-commerce companies in the bricks-and-mortar to omni providers to ensure that we minimize the cost from when we make it to when the consumer gets it, working with them to reduce the transportation or last mile. So all of those are active strategies. We can -- other than the 50% U.S., if there's more specifics that you need, ask Jon so he can to follow up with you after this meeting to get any more specifics by quarter.\nJon Moeller: I think, Robert, we are -- to your question of are we relatively advantaged within that broadly defined channel, including omni commerce and brick and click, et cetera. I continue to believe we are. That's no reason to rest. But as you and I have talked before, it is in reality a limited assortment environment from a practical shopping standpoint. And as a result of that, the barriers to entry are very, very high. The need to be on the first and second page of a search, preferences large established superior brands, which we have. Again, no guarantee of the future and no reason to rest. But we embrace the evolution of markets towards e-commerce.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nCody Ross: It's actually Cody on for Jason this morning. I just want to hit the Home Care section a little bit. You guys cited 30% growth this quarter. How does the supply-demand balance look right now across the industry? And from a supply point of view, are you guys investing in more capacity right now? And how much capacity have you seen come on already? Or do you expect to come on as competitors invest in more capacity?\nDavid Taylor: Okay. Cody, let me take a couple of those and some of the data. Certainly, I don't know what's happening with competitors on capacity. Home Care had an outstanding year. And again, in Home Care, in our world, is Dish Care, surface care and air care. So those categories and those brands globally. The category grew about 16% this year -- or our results rather, we grew ahead of the category and grew share. In terms of capacity, there are areas like our Microban launch that went out in February that we are capacity constrained now because we launched right as it was hitting, and the notes to us and the demand spiked. Today, the run rate is now in a couple of hundred million dollar range, which is more than we expected at the time we launched. We expected more of a -- more typical build although we knew it was a very attractive product because of the sustained surface benefit -- surface scale benefits it offered. In areas like Swiffer and hand dish, we're also working very hard to make sure we get inventories back up, but the demand spiked. You can imagine with people now fixing more meals at home are Dawn and around the world, Fairy. And our automatic dish, which would be cascading around the world Fairy, both of those have spiked. And we've seen the Home Care category, if I take the U.S., sometimes the category size over many of these weeks has been in the 1.30 to 1.40 range. We've been able to meet most of that need. There are again some specific items where we're working very hard to increase the capacity, and that will be coming on and kind of feather in over the next couple of quarters. But we continue to ship very, very well. And we're getting back both shelves, and eventually, the customer inventory and our inventory is back in line, but we're not there yet as we close the fiscal year and certainly into July. And as of through this July, we have not seen the demand slow down very much yet in the Home Care area, which bodes well for the year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: So wanted to touch on some of the changing consumer presence commentary and talk about SK-II in particular and trying to ask whether you still think it makes sense to own a brand with as much volatility as it has relative to the base portfolio these days. Obviously, it's had a lot of contribution to growth in recent years. So I guess can you reassess kind of broadly? Can you kind of comment a bit about that specifically in terms of how you're thinking about the portfolio today would be great?\nDavid Taylor: First, the first question, how do we feel about SK-II? Very committed and thrilled that we have it. There was certainly a bump the last 4 months that hit us hard with mainly travel retail business. But if you look even at the last few months in China, growing very nicely now. And as we go into the year works, we continue to be optimistic about the brand. Consumers love the brand. And we have brands focused on meeting consumer needs and SK-II does a great job. It's had several years of sustained top and bottom line growth. And frankly, I'm not discouraged at all by a 4- or 5-month dip because, largely, the travel retail business got impacted. In the markets that it competes with the consumers in where it is present, it continues to do well, and it's already starting to rebound. So now we're very committed to SK-II. And if I step back at the global Skin and Personal Care business, which includes, again, the Personal Care, APDO, Skin Care and Prestige skin, that whole category, even with what happened to SK-II, grew nicely last year, in the upper mid-single digits, indicating that the broad portfolio can weather a hit like that, and it's consistently the global Beauty has consistently been performing well for the last couple of years. And so they're optimistic again that the business that was travel retail will find itself somewhere else if consumers looking for the brand will go where they can find it. And we've seen that more recently with the rebound in China with SK-II.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nWilliam Chappell: Could you just talk about kind of your outlook over the next year for the Grooming category? I mean especially kind of worldwide, I mean, how it plays out? You have, obviously, corona beards in the U.S. So nice to read that mullets are coming back in Australia over the weekend. And so anything you see there that kind of how, as we come out of this, or is the category permanently impaired? Or do you see it slowly get growth as we move into calendar '21? Just any thoughts would be great.\nDavid Taylor: Sure. While we've seen a hit in the COVID period, Grooming up through January was actually making very good progress. And even with the COVID hit and people at home and less shaving because of people not going outside or may not going outside, it still grew this last year. And if I take up through January, the first 7 months of the year, it was growing faster. It was the fastest growth we've seen in several years. We've actually seen an increase this year in new users. We've got the fastest new user growth we've seen in many years, which means people are coming in. What we have done, though, and this is important, we have a -- certainly, the male Blades & Razors is the biggest part of the business, but we have male and female. We have the full ladder, including disposables, which have again grown. And now we've gotten a very fast-growing appliance business, call it Braun, which is growing share, and it's growing double digit right now as people have moved to a dry form in some places. And then we've launched a King C. Gillette initiative to address men with hair. So the shave category is really now embraced. The category is growing and is taking care of people with here, without facial hair, men, women, all price points. And as it does that, to me, it's right now creating a strategy that will allow it to grow in most environments. And I believe we will see, as people go back to look in offices and outside the home, we'll see a pickup in the wet shave rate. In the meantime, we'll continue to see very robust growth in dry save, very robust growth in this King C. Gillette new brand that addresses many of the tools needed for people with facial hair for grooming facial here. So it's also a highly profitable business that continues to -- that we're very committed to long term. One other comment, we grew double digits in China this last year, which is another indication that as the economy came back and while it's not post-COVID, China has returned more to a more normal operating environment than most countries and Grooming is growing double digit in that country, which, again, tells me that the broader portfolio can and will grow in the future and create value for the company.\nOperator: And your final question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: I'm glad to hear you well and congrats on the results. If you can give us the cadence of the fourth quarter exit rate or July to date. From your guidance, it seems we're taking some destocking in the U.S. but can you help us think about the assumptions for your sales curve, including a potential more mild cold season ahead? Or just the market share momentum you spoke throughout this call should offset a shifting against consumption dynamics?\nJon Moeller: Andrea, as you can probably appreciate, the monthly cadence, if you will, is very different by category, by market and it has been volatile. Recently, it's hard to make coherent sense out of it. But the overall thought that I would give you is that it's remained strong throughout. July has remained strong. But we also have to remember that all of that's happened, for instance, in a U.S. context with significant financial stimulus. And we don't know as we sit here today, what the future of that is going to look like and whether it will exist. And that's just one example of the pretty dramatic unknowns that make it difficult for me to say because July has started off well, we should assume the first quarter is going to be strong. I can't say that.\nDavid Taylor: One other -- just to offer is, to a large degree, it depends on what you believe the markets in broad will grow. I think Jon's earlier statement, and certainly, our view is we will grow ahead of the market, and our innovation will be a stimulant to market growth. But there are macro factors that are big enough, whether it's the recession, the COVID impact, disruptions to supply chain, but it's very hard to predict. We ended the quarter with good momentum. And certainly, as we go into the quarter, good momentum. The health, hygiene and cleaning categories, we think will be focused -- will be focused categories for consumers. And it's your guess as good as ours on when people will and increasing in numbers would turn back to offices and be working outside the home. At this point in time right now, it looks like in the U.S., that's slowing down, but it varies all over the world. In aggregate, we think we're well positioned for whatever comes at us to do better than what the market would give. And we'll work very hard to make sure that we continue to be good contributors to our consumers, our customers and to the communities in which we operate. Thank you. Thank you all.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, everybody. Jon and Kerry and myself will be available the balance of the day. We're at our normal work numbers, feel free to contact us. I know it's a busy day for many of you. I will also be here tomorrow. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is well. As we outlined last quarter, we've established 3 immediate priorities that guide our actions and our choices in this crisis period. Our first priority is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. With guidance from medical professionals, we're constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making, packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand.  This leads to the second priority: maximizing the availability of products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. These products are more important than ever given the needs created by the current crisis. There's an increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time we're all spending at home.  Third priority is supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure families have basic access to everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We're providing significant financial support to numerous relief agencies around the world. We're producing hand sanitizer, face mask and face shields in P&G facilities for our internal use and also for donation to organizations in great need.  Finally, we're using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. And P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of the employees -- of our employees, maximize the availability of P&G products to serve consumers and help society overcome the challenges in this period.  Our integrated strategic choices remain the right ones. They serve each of our immediate priorities and that the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We're focused on portfolio of daily-use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.  Within these categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. The most sustainable and profitable way to grow is to create new business versus just taking or trading it. Superior offerings, science-based products delivered to a superior packaging drive market growth, which in turn drives share, sales and profit growth. This creates a winning proposition for all concerned, high expansion versus 0 sum. It's the only growth our retailers care about. Growth that is incremental to the category. And if we lead category growth with superior offerings, we will mathematically build market share.  We strive to communicate product and packaging benefits with superior brand messaging. P&G was just named the #1 brand marketer of the decade at the Cannes Lions Festival Creativity in June. Not only has our advertising been creative, it's been increasingly effective at growing markets and building our business. I'm particularly proud of this as it speaks to sustained excellence versus a few great ads.  In addition to winning with consumers' communication, we need superior retail execution, online and in physical stores that contributes to the growth of categories and our brands. Our superior performance in this area has been recognized in third-party surveys of retailers and awards from top customers that we've been mentioned previously. Most recently, Target recognized P&G as supplier of the year across all our product categories in the store. We appreciate the recognitions we've received, but really matters is retailers' improved view of P&G as a partner and joint value creation, helping retailers grow categories and create value on strong distribution, share of shelf, display and feature.  The fifth vector of superiority is value for consumers and for customers. In performance-driven categories, consumers often see the value in paying a modest premium for noticeably better product performance. We're strengthening our innovation across price tiers with the aim of delivering superior value at each price tier where we compete. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world.  The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business, delivering strong cost and cash productivity. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future.  In this environment, agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both producing and helping more? What new needs must be met and in what new ways? We're fostering an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility.  Our new organization structure, 6 industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focused markets and enterprise markets and very small corporate groups with best-in-class functional expertise is also serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  These strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend the superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organizational focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow share, sales and profit. Some examples. Global Home Care improved its noticeable superiority from less than 60% in fiscal '18 to nearly 80% superiority this fiscal year. We invested in product performance, in packaging in each of the subcategories: hand dish, auto dish, dish care and surface care, including launching our new Microban 24 surface standardization product in February.  We step-changed consumer communication, leveraging educational TV advertising, which delivered an immediate lift to the category and our brands by showing consumers more ways to use our products. We elevated in-store execution with additional navigational and educational signage to help the consumer choose the product that is right for them. These superiority investments have yielded strong results. And most importantly, they've grown markets, both before and after the pandemic. P&G Home Care has driven over 60% of the global category market growth and accelerated organic sales growth from low single digits to double digits, increased profit, improved market share 1.5 points and increased household penetration, all in the last 2 years. The business grew organic sales 7% in fiscal '19, 7% in the first half of fiscal '20 ahead of the crisis. We had great momentum that only accelerated in the second half of the year with nearly 25% organic growth. China fem care has been driving category growth through superior innovation and demand creation. Innovation is focused on organics, overnight protection and teens. The Whisper brand has driven 25% of category growth, well above its 12% market share. The brand has grown market share over 2 points over the last 3 years and grown organic sales at an average rate in the high teens over this period. One more, P&G U.S. Personal Home Care -- Health Care, rather, has focused on improving the superiority across all 5 vectors, reaching over 80% superiority across the portfolio this year.  P&G brands drove more than 25% of category growth this past year, roughly double their market share weight. Vicks, Metamucil, Pepto-Bismol, Prilosec, Align and ZzzQuil each grew share over the past 3, 6 and 12-month periods, with total U.S. P&G Personal Health Care value share of 1 point or more over these time periods. U.S. Personal Health Care delivered its fourth consecutive year of organic sales growth with high single-digit growth in fiscal '19 and double-digit growth in fiscal '20. We think our strategies, the success we've had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and a clean home all bode well for the future. The relevance of our categories and consumers' lives has increased. There may be a long-term increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. Organizational agility, high employee engagement, to meet the changing needs of consumers and retailers likely becomes more important. We believe P&G is well positioned to serve consumers' heightened needs and their changing behaviors and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value creation. I'll turn it back over to John to cover the outlook for fiscal 2021. We delivered a very strong fiscal 2020, meeting or beating each of the key goals we set out at the start of the year in a challenging and volatile market. We believe we have a bright future ahead. We have the right strategies, portfolio and daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority and products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organizational focus, agility and accountability. We feel we have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the company is facing, ensuring the health -- employee health and safety, maximizing product availability and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and communities. We're investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization.  We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest, in the interest of our long-term share owners with an eye fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation.  With that, we would be happy to answer your questions. Wendy, I'll make one comment, then I want to turn it to Jon because he has direct responsibility for the enterprise markets. The comment I'd make is the organizational structure change we made has really helped us deal with this recent pandemic. We grew in enterprise markets where they're facing just a range, as you know, of very big challenges. But if anything, it's reinforced the strength of the organization of choice and actually the possibilities we see for the future. I want to turn it to Jon to talk how we're dealing with it directly. But no, we haven't changed our long-term view on the attractiveness of the enterprise markets. Certainly. All good questions -- many questions there. First, the -- if I look at what's happened for the last couple of years, if anything, it's just reinforced the set of choices that we've made. What we are seeing and the pandemic's, frankly, accelerated is consumers are right now moving more and more back to trusted brands. The pandemic has actually put many, many more people back in their homes. And if you think about health, hygiene and cleaning categories, and we said it a lot, and sometimes I think people get tired of it, but it's categories where performance drives brand choice really matters. And I think it matters even more now.  We were seeing that before the pandemic because we grew very, very well in the first half of the year, 6%, and we saw it through the pandemic. But those -- that focus on health, hygiene and cleaning and are having things that really matter. And one of the other points that I think in the strategy that's really working and it fits what's going on right now is because of the shift to e-commerce, there's tremendous pressure on retailers, and frankly, all participants on profitability. So if your strategy is one where innovation grows the category size, when you do that, you create the larger pie, which allows both the retailer to increase their profitability, to manufacture, and it doesn't put the rest of the industry in a bad place. It's actually in a better place. So to me, I believe the strategy is actually moving in the right place.  You mentioned ESG, I think it's another area where P&G has particular strengths. Well before it was in vogue, P&G has always had a position of being a very strong corporate citizen. We have stood up in both social sustainability and environmental sustainability with sustained efforts in those areas. It's the way we operate. It's consistent with our values. And so as there's been a greater focus on that, I think that as well matters because consumers more and more, as well as all stakeholders, one on the values of the company is behind the brand. And I think that also plays well to the strategy. What I feel one of the things best about is we have not had to make big shifts in our strategy as a result of what's happened. It's just reinforced the importance of it.  And the final point I'd make is the organizational changes that we made, which are putting more accountability closer to where our consumers or customers are and recognizing the inherent strength of our people and capability of the organization in unleashing it to me has shown sequentially stronger and stronger results and better and better activation of that strategy. And you saw it going into the crisis because, again, the crisis accelerated trends that were happening and our people stepped up magnificently well and beyond trying to deliver the business. They initiated many of these projects to, can we make mask and donate them? Can we make hand sanitizers and donate some of those? Face shields, we've never made. But a group -- 2 different groups decided they could repurpose some of our packaging equipment and turn that packaging equipment into something that can make face shields, and we've shipped hundreds of thousands of face shields to the medical community. But it just shows you that when you have engaged people that care about both the consumers and the communities, what they can do. So it's just we accelerated the choices we've made. And Kevin, I think it's put us in a very good position coming out of the pandemic because of the capabilities we've been developing. I'll make one comment, again, I'll turn it to Jon on this one. We've talked a great deal about the fact that all buckets, all spin pools have been looked at and we've leveraged to me both the digital ecosystem as well as the capabilities of our organization to make substantive changes. And one of the best illustrations of that is what happened when the pandemic hit, we started to see both attendance issues and supply challenges. We've learned time and time again that when we ask groups of people to step up and address change, they can do it incredibly well. We've had plants that have operated at 90% of their effectiveness with half the people in the short run, demonstrating again there's more there. But I'll turn it to Jon to get the specifics, but both the gross margin and operating margin to meet progress has been sustained over the last several years. And if you look forward, we see still tremendous amount in both media. We see with many of our nonconsumer-facing spending areas as well as cost of goods. Jon? Again, several questions. First, when the pandemic hit, yes, in some categories, we went to more simplified SKU lineups in order to maximize the capacity of the high turn items. And I'm sure we and many others did that. And we learned through that as well. In some cases, where there were some smaller volume SKUs that meet special consumer needs, and they will come back. There's also some opportunities for some continued SKU rationalization to better serve consumers and meet the retailers' needs. So both of those are happening. It's very category specific on what we're doing. But I'd say, in general, there's a sharper look at can we have a more focused portfolio with really differentiated products. So I think, yes, that will continue.  The change in manufacturing to me, in order to adjust the agility needed, I think is one of the other things that's really been an area that we're working before, but coming into the crisis and then through it. Looking at business continuity plans, the total supply system, look at the appropriate number of suppliers in order to ensure you have the agility to react to instantaneous capacity swings that we're seeing. I think there's all been learning in those areas. I expect on the other side of this, again, varying by category, but there will be some streamlining in order to meet the needs. And in some of the categories, because there will be a sustained increase in consumption, we're looking at what we need to do to ensure we have the right capacity to meet those needs. Because I think a lot of the spike that we've seen is not going to go away in some of these categories. Consumers are developing new habits. And I think many of us believe that will last well beyond the pandemic. Yes. First, on the market trends, our market share, global market share has actually strengthened through the year. We were up 0.3 for the total year, 0.4 for 6 months, 0.5 for the past 3. In terms of the last quarter, in terms of promotion intensity activity, as you would imagine, in categories where there's supply constraints, you'd see less promotion as everybody focuses on meeting the basic supply needs of the customers and the consumers. And on the categories of tissue/towel, which is our Family Care, Home Care, which will just surface and air, that's largely continued into this fiscal year as the demand hasn't ceased. And if you take the U.S., it's our largest market we wanted to focus on. As you know, when you watch the daily news and you hit the daily news, there's just a lot of debate on how much it will open up or even stop or even go back.  So I think the focus on Home, Personal Care, cleaning and hygiene is likely to sustain itself. And so I don't expect in the short run dramatic changes in the promotion environment, although, again, it's very category specific, and in many cases, very country specific. We've chosen to stay extraordinarily focused on the strategy, which is focused on investing in the superiority across the 5 elements we've talked. And through this last couple of years, that's consistently worked in both high promotion environments, which we see in some countries and categories, and in this last 3 to 4 months when there was lower promotion because of supply constraints. And as I think about next year, there will be, I'm sure, competitors will come in and they'll have innovation and there'll be changes in their promotion strategy. But we've tried not to get distracted from the strategy that's working and, again, across the balance of countries and categories, that continues to work, and I think it will. Jon? Olivia, first, just the last thing you said, whether most of this coming from the established brands or long tail, our core is going very well. Fabric care is growing. Fabric, tissue/towel, Home Care, Health Care, all going very well. Our Beauty business grew very well last year. Skin Care, Personal Care, APDO, antiperspirant and deodorant, all that grew well. So the core grew well, and again, it's central to the strategy, and it's obviously the biggest part of the business. And the 2 biggest markets grew were U.S. and China. If I look forward, in order for us to be a dependable long-term grower, we have to grow the core. And the strategy is focused on making sure the core is healthy. And the core has to continue to extend to address new benefits that are relevant in those categories. And there's many, many examples we've given in the past of that, and certainly, we get more of the Home Care examples that you see out with Microban and many of the other things that occurred on Mr. Clean brand and Febreze brands over time. We also believe in RC and certainly, some of the additional investments we've made are paying out, both internally developed innovation as well as some of the acquired innovation. Our track record is getting increasingly better on those as well. And this year, we have certainly some things coming out of our P&G venture. But that's a small portion of the total company. But what it does speak to is innovation is driven core, core and more and then in new benefit spaces, new jobs that we can do.  To me, it speaks to just the whole innovation process is working in the company. But I fully expect for the year that we're going into right now and the next several years, the core will be the biggest driver of that. And there's still significant opportunities. So what I wouldn't think is we're in mature categories. 4 years ago, people said we are mature categories. And now you see big established businesses and take Fabric & Home Care, that it have moved from low single digits to mid-single digits to high single digits in many, many countries. And if you get down to the next level and look at household penetration by item, and what you see is many of them are in the 10% to 30% range and 10% to 30%, which means the majority of consumers haven't used the product in the last year and haven't experienced the new benefit of the improved performance that we've built. So -- and we've gone back to rediscover the opportunity to build household penetration, new users, grow the market size, leverage superiority to bring their users in and then leverage additional benefits to trade people up to higher order performance. That's happened across the 10 core categories. And then when you do it well, you grow share. And probably the best example I gave earlier was in Personal Health Care where virtually every brand grew share over 3, 6 and 12 months. And it's because of new innovation that they bought to the market. It's delighting the consumers. So core, core and more and then our venture effort to me is it's now producing new brands with Zevo, an update coming out this year. We'll take a cut at some of those. I'm not sure I have all the specifics. Although some of those, we can certainly get you afterwards. The e-commerce business has been growing for now several years in the 30% to 40% range. As you know, we're most developed in China. The U.S. is also growing extremely fast, and we expect it to continue. We've adjusted -- and again, it fits with the strategy. We've adjusted our supply chain, including our packaging capability, to be able to meet the needs of e-commerce, consumers and e-commerce aggregators that had different needs because of the -- instead of shipping it in a case in a pilot load to a store. It's in each going through a different path to the consumer, and that's worked well. One of the things we've worked very hard on and is present today is we want e-commerce shares growing in absolute, and we want e-commerce shares to be equal or higher than their off-line shares, and we're working to have the same profitability. And we've made very good progress on both of those as well in the U.S. and China and in Europe. And that will continue to be a priority. We want to be agnostic to where the consumers buy the product. In the most recent period, the U.S. e-commerce business that was up 50% in fiscal '20, we all know there's a spike driven by COVID. How much of that will sustain? We'll see. But I think many are developing new habits. So I think we are prepared for that to continue to grow at that pace and meet the consumers' needs and we've developed. The last point I'd make, additional capability because we've worked with many of the e-commerce companies in the bricks-and-mortar to omni providers to ensure that we minimize the cost from when we make it to when the consumer gets it, working with them to reduce the transportation or last mile. So all of those are active strategies. We can -- other than the 50% U.S., if there's more specifics that you need, ask Jon so he can to follow up with you after this meeting to get any more specifics by quarter. Okay. Cody, let me take a couple of those and some of the data. Certainly, I don't know what's happening with competitors on capacity. Home Care had an outstanding year. And again, in Home Care, in our world, is Dish Care, surface care and air care. So those categories and those brands globally. The category grew about 16% this year -- or our results rather, we grew ahead of the category and grew share. In terms of capacity, there are areas like our Microban launch that went out in February that we are capacity constrained now because we launched right as it was hitting, and the notes to us and the demand spiked. Today, the run rate is now in a couple of hundred million dollar range, which is more than we expected at the time we launched. We expected more of a -- more typical build although we knew it was a very attractive product because of the sustained surface benefit -- surface scale benefits it offered. In areas like Swiffer and hand dish, we're also working very hard to make sure we get inventories back up, but the demand spiked. You can imagine with people now fixing more meals at home are Dawn and around the world, Fairy. And our automatic dish, which would be cascading around the world Fairy, both of those have spiked. And we've seen the Home Care category, if I take the U.S., sometimes the category size over many of these weeks has been in the 1.30 to 1.40 range. We've been able to meet most of that need. There are again some specific items where we're working very hard to increase the capacity, and that will be coming on and kind of feather in over the next couple of quarters. But we continue to ship very, very well. And we're getting back both shelves, and eventually, the customer inventory and our inventory is back in line, but we're not there yet as we close the fiscal year and certainly into July. And as of through this July, we have not seen the demand slow down very much yet in the Home Care area, which bodes well for the year. First, the first question, how do we feel about SK-II? Very committed and thrilled that we have it. There was certainly a bump the last 4 months that hit us hard with mainly travel retail business. But if you look even at the last few months in China, growing very nicely now. And as we go into the year works, we continue to be optimistic about the brand. Consumers love the brand. And we have brands focused on meeting consumer needs and SK-II does a great job. It's had several years of sustained top and bottom line growth. And frankly, I'm not discouraged at all by a 4- or 5-month dip because, largely, the travel retail business got impacted. In the markets that it competes with the consumers in where it is present, it continues to do well, and it's already starting to rebound. So now we're very committed to SK-II. And if I step back at the global Skin and Personal Care business, which includes, again, the Personal Care, APDO, Skin Care and Prestige skin, that whole category, even with what happened to SK-II, grew nicely last year, in the upper mid-single digits, indicating that the broad portfolio can weather a hit like that, and it's consistently the global Beauty has consistently been performing well for the last couple of years. And so they're optimistic again that the business that was travel retail will find itself somewhere else if consumers looking for the brand will go where they can find it. And we've seen that more recently with the rebound in China with SK-II. Sure. While we've seen a hit in the COVID period, Grooming up through January was actually making very good progress. And even with the COVID hit and people at home and less shaving because of people not going outside or may not going outside, it still grew this last year. And if I take up through January, the first 7 months of the year, it was growing faster. It was the fastest growth we've seen in several years. We've actually seen an increase this year in new users. We've got the fastest new user growth we've seen in many years, which means people are coming in. What we have done, though, and this is important, we have a -- certainly, the male Blades & Razors is the biggest part of the business, but we have male and female. We have the full ladder, including disposables, which have again grown. And now we've gotten a very fast-growing appliance business, call it Braun, which is growing share, and it's growing double digit right now as people have moved to a dry form in some places. And then we've launched a King C. Gillette initiative to address men with hair. So the shave category is really now embraced. The category is growing and is taking care of people with here, without facial hair, men, women, all price points. And as it does that, to me, it's right now creating a strategy that will allow it to grow in most environments. And I believe we will see, as people go back to look in offices and outside the home, we'll see a pickup in the wet shave rate. In the meantime, we'll continue to see very robust growth in dry save, very robust growth in this King C. Gillette new brand that addresses many of the tools needed for people with facial hair for grooming facial here. So it's also a highly profitable business that continues to -- that we're very committed to long term. One other comment, we grew double digits in China this last year, which is another indication that as the economy came back and while it's not post-COVID, China has returned more to a more normal operating environment than most countries and Grooming is growing double digit in that country, which, again, tells me that the broader portfolio can and will grow in the future and create value for the company. One other -- just to offer is, to a large degree, it depends on what you believe the markets in broad will grow. I think Jon's earlier statement, and certainly, our view is we will grow ahead of the market, and our innovation will be a stimulant to market growth. But there are macro factors that are big enough, whether it's the recession, the COVID impact, disruptions to supply chain, but it's very hard to predict. We ended the quarter with good momentum. And certainly, as we go into the quarter, good momentum. The health, hygiene and cleaning categories, we think will be focused -- will be focused categories for consumers. And it's your guess as good as ours on when people will and increasing in numbers would turn back to offices and be working outside the home. At this point in time right now, it looks like in the U.S., that's slowing down, but it varies all over the world. In aggregate, we think we're well positioned for whatever comes at us to do better than what the market would give. And we'll work very hard to make sure that we continue to be good contributors to our consumers, our customers and to the communities in which we operate. Thank you. Thank you all."

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, joining me this morning.  We're back in our offices in Cincinnati with our masks, appropriately distanced. We'd like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are also safe and are well. I'm going to provide an overview of company results, which continue to be strong. David will cast additional light on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2021, and of course, take your questions.  Fiscal 2020 was a very strong year. We grew markets and increased household penetration, driving top line growth, bottom line growth as well as market share. It's what we call balanced growth and value creation. Organic sales grew 6%. On a 2-year stack basis, organic sales growth has accelerated from 3% across fiscals '17 and '18 to 6% across fiscal '18 and '19 to 11% over the last 2 years, indicating the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of our strategy, which is driving our business.  We built strong momentum in 1.5 years leading up to the COVID crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019, including 6% in the first half of fiscal 2020. We maintained the strong momentum in the second half of fiscal 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories, significantly increased production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs.  David talked at CAGNY 4 years ago about accelerating growth in our 2 largest and most profitable markets. Fiscal year 2020, U.S. organic sales grew 10%, including 5% growth in the first half of the fiscal. China grew 8%, including 13% organic growth in the first half of the year. 9 of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care and Personal Health Care, up in the teens; Family Care, up double digits; Fabric Care and Feminine Care, up high singles. Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Oral Care, up mid-singles. Grooming, up 1. Baby, down 1. 30 of our top 50 country category combinations held or grew share.  E-commerce sales were up 40% for the year, up 30% in the first half and 50% in the second half, now over $7 billion in sales, over 10% of the company total. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were up 13%. Currency-neutral core earnings per share up 17%. Within this, core gross margin expanded 170 basis points, up 190 basis points constant FX. Core operating margin grew 180 basis points, up 210 basis points, excluding currency impacts.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 114%. We increased our dividend 6% and returned $15.2 billion of value to share owners, $7.8 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase. Capping a strong year, a very strong April-June quarter. Organic sales up more than 6% on top of a base period that was up 7%. Volume, pricing and mix, each contributed to top line growth. Strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets, up 19% in the U.S. and 14% in Greater China. Strong market share trends, with aggregate global value share up 50 basis points. At the bottom line, core earnings per share of $1.16, up 5% versus the prior year, up 11% on a currency-neutral basis, including a 7 point headwind from gains on land and small brand sales in the base period. Core gross margin, up 210 basis points, up 250 ex FX. Core operating margin, up 140 basis points, up 190 ex FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 161%.  Coming up, we delivered or overdelivered on each of our going end targets for the year: organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to share owners. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and arguably built this further during the challenging second half of the year. I know I speak for David and the rest of our leadership team when I say that credit for these results goes to our colleagues. The men and women of P&G, who have demonstrated incredible creativity, agility and commitment to serving consumers and customers every day during these unprecedented times.  We will continue to face significant challenges and perhaps a higher degree of uncertainty than any of us have ever faced. But we believe that current consumer dynamics are integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies and our focus on a few immediate priorities position us very well for the future. David? To underscore David's comments, we like our long-term prospects, rooted in service of consumers with increasing needs. The near term, though, will be challenging and is more difficult to predict. Our outlook starts with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. We'll likely be operating without a vaccine or advanced therapeutics through fiscal '21. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world.  In the U.S., it's unclear how long we'll be operating at double-digit unemployment levels and how long there will be mitigating economic stimulus available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics result in an increased cost to operate. There's also a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers being shut down due to local mandates.  Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. We're targeting organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year and markets where growth could range from flat to around 3% value growth.  We're targeting core earnings per share growth of 3% to 7% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. The bottom line outlook reflects the full range of potential top line outcomes. It also incorporates $300 million after-tax of foreign exchange headwinds, largely offset by $275 million after-tax and commodity cost tailwinds. This outlook also includes a $150 million after-tax headwind from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income.  If you consider the quarterly cadence of the year, base period comps will play a significant role in top line trends. Organic sales growth should be stronger in the first half of the year and moderate in the second half as we annualize the recent acceleration in category growth. Bottom line growth should be somewhat stronger in the second half due mainly to higher cost productivity as the year progresses.  Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to share owners. We're targeting another year of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.  Now I'll hand it back quickly to David for closing comments. And I'm going to take one step to the side, and then I'll come hopefully back to the middle here. Remember that the whole -- from an organization structure context, one of the driving forces and the design was to free up category leaders and sector CEOs to focus on the biggest opportunities, which were the focus markets where we generate 80% of our sales and 90% of our profit. And I, of course, don't want to assert direct causality, but there's nothing to indicate that isn't exactly what's happening. So in the U.S., we grew, as we've said earlier, 10% over the year, 19% in the last quarter. In China, we grew 8% over the year, 14% in the last quarter. Those are our 2 largest focus markets. So that part of the organization strategy is working well. We also wanted to move decision-making in enterprise markets closer to consumers, competitors, customers, with the hope that we would continue to provide strong growth in those markets, both on a top and bottom line standpoint, and that continues to be the case. We grew despite all the difficulty of the last year, 3% organically on the top line. We grew 16% on the bottom line. We exited the year with only 2 of the enterprise markets. That's over 100 countries, losing money, which is unprecedented for us. And we did that, we built that profitability despite significant headwinds and while growing market share. In aggregate, the enterprise markets were up 0.2 points. But we're happy with all of that. Now to get back to the middle and answer to your questions more directly. Yes, we're facing challenges in the enterprise market as a result of the current both health and economic crisis. And yes, it is affecting market sizes negatively. And no, that's not over and arguably continues to worsen.  In terms of our long-term view on these markets, they're an incredibly important piece of the company. We generated in enterprise markets, I think we crossed $14 billion in sales this year, $1.6 billion in aftertax profit. So they're meaningful and can create value. We want to be more consistent in our efforts to do that. So we have made changes to our business models, to our cost structures, to ensure that as we grow in these markets, we can do that profitably. But we remain committed to success in these markets and highly confident we can deliver that. Just two comments. One, I'm glad you realize, and I know you always have, that the productivity savings do accrue more to the back half of the year than the front half of the year because that's going to be important as you think about your quarterly cadence for estimates next year because the same thing, the same pattern will hold true. We have learned a ton, as David was indicating, as a result of the experience we've been through the last 4 months. And one of the things I believe we've learned is that there is even more opportunity than we thought. I'll just give you one simple and obvious example, travel and entertainment. We never really -- I don't think could have imagined that we'd be accomplishing all we are with effectively 0 travel and entertainment. And that's not the right long-term answer. But the right long-term answer is not what we were doing previously. We've all become much more effective working in very different ways with digital tools, as David indicated. I think the general comfort with digital tools that are available to us makes it much more likely that we will seek those tools out in terms of improving our work efficiency and effectiveness across all of our activity systems. So there is -- David mentioned the manufacturing efficiency, which is clearly an opportunity as well. So we continue to be committed to productivity as a fundamental foundation stone in our strategy. It enables the investment in superiority, which grows markets and then flows through the income statement. On consumer trade-down, as we've talked before, we're not immune to that, and that could become an increasing dynamic going forward to the extent unemployment grows and stimulus and support shrinks. But as we've also talked, we're in a much better position to deal with that than we have been historically. And I think the environment actually helps us as well. So let me quickly unpack that. We have focused our portfolio, as we've talked several times over in this call, in categories where performance drives brand choice. By definition then, a portion of the value equation is performance. And to the extent that we have an advantage in performance, that's noticeably -- that's noticeable and obvious. That, along with a fair price, albeit a small premium, is viewed as offering value. And we have a much higher percentage of our portfolio that's well positioned in that context than as we headed into the last recession. And the needs for performance, so the degree to which performance affects our consumer's personal value equation, vis-a\u0300-vis, price is higher than it's ever been, which also works in our favor. The -- to date, this can change, obviously. But to date, if you look at private label market shares as one proxy of trade down, we're not seeing it. Private label shares in aggregate across our categories in the U.S. were down 40 basis points in the last 3 months. They were essentially flat in Europe. Last point, we have significantly built out, not always perfectly, but we've built out our pricing ladders. We didn't have items like Tide simply available for consumers in the last recession, and we have many more of those currently. So again, we're not immune. It's real. The best way to attack it is with performance, noticeably superior performance at a fair value to have the right pack sizes available for consumers who are limited in terms of their cash outlay and double down on the strategy that's working versus stepping back. So the first piece of context I'd provide on the top line guidance for next year, because I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's all based on what we're expecting on market growth, and then we would expect to grow slightly ahead of that and continue building share. And as I mentioned, we see markets growing modestly, probably 1% to 3%. And so the 2% to 4% range is consistent with building share in that environment. If we look at our own forecast, Nick, for top line growth in enterprise versus the balance of the market, they're both within that range. So we're going to continue to expect not only total company growth, but both focus on enterprise market growth on both the top and bottom line. Clearly, in the current context, so let's just use that as a proxy for the future, we're seeing very strong growth in U.S. and China, as we've talked. If you look at the quarter, growth in Europe was much more modest, but that has picked up recently. And clearly, while we expect growth from the enterprise markets, they're currently the most challenged just in terms of the operating environment and the economic -- both economic and health pressures that families are feeling. I think, Robert, we are -- to your question of are we relatively advantaged within that broadly defined channel, including omni commerce and brick and click, et cetera. I continue to believe we are. That's no reason to rest. But as you and I have talked before, it is in reality a limited assortment environment from a practical shopping standpoint. And as a result of that, the barriers to entry are very, very high. The need to be on the first and second page of a search, preferences large established superior brands, which we have. Again, no guarantee of the future and no reason to rest. But we embrace the evolution of markets towards e-commerce. Andrea, as you can probably appreciate, the monthly cadence, if you will, is very different by category, by market and it has been volatile. Recently, it's hard to make coherent sense out of it. But the overall thought that I would give you is that it's remained strong throughout. July has remained strong. But we also have to remember that all of that's happened, for instance, in a U.S. context with significant financial stimulus. And we don't know as we sit here today, what the future of that is going to look like and whether it will exist. And that's just one example of the pretty dramatic unknowns that make it difficult for me to say because July has started off well, we should assume the first quarter is going to be strong. I can't say that. Thanks, everybody. Jon and Kerry and myself will be available the balance of the day. We're at our normal work numbers, feel free to contact us. I know it's a busy day for many of you. I will also be here tomorrow. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. I\u2019m here at home by myself coming to you through my cell phone. John Chevalier is at his home and is prepared to jump in if for any reason my connection fails and I can\u2019t reestablish it. We\u2019re all going through a difficult and challenging time. And I want to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and are well. Thank you for joining us on accelerated timing. Our motivation in advancing the timing of this release was simply transparency, giving information to you and to the market as quickly as possible. We\u2019ve had a very strong quarter, but I\u2019m going to start by outlining our priorities in the crisis period. These have been and will continue to guide our actions and our choices. I\u2019ll then move quickly to strategy, which remains unwavering. I\u2019ll discuss actual and potential results for three time periods, the quarter we just completed, which as I said was strong; the long-term on the backside of this crisis; and then, the short to midterm as we all work our way through this. Following this, I\u2019ll answer a couple of anticipated questions and then turn to additional questions that are on your or your clients\u2019 minds. Our first priority in this crisis is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. Second, we\u2019re maximizing the availability of products that help people and their families with their health hygiene and cleaning needs, which has never been greater. The next priority is helping society meet and overcome the challenges we all face. Taken together, these priorities help ensure P&G is there, there for employees, there for consumers, there for communities who have always been there for us. Let me briefly discuss each of these priorities in turn. Employee safety and health. With guidance from medical professionals, we\u2019re constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This includes temperature scans, shift rotations, queuing avoidance and physical distancing. We\u2019re performing comprehensive methodical cleaning of all production areas including regular sanitization and surface disinfection that exceeds the most rigorous health authority standards. We\u2019re also equipping and encouraging all employees to make smart appropriate choices, such as staying at home if they feel unwell or part of high risk groups or have preexisting medical conditions. In all cases, we\u2019re partnering with our colleagues individually and proactively to ensure they feel and are protected and safe. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand. Our industry-leading benefits plans play a critical role in providing P&G people with the resources they need to care for themselves and for their families. From paid leave and comprehensive medical care to flexible work arrangements and financial support, P&G people can work confidently knowing that the Company stands with and behind them. It\u2019s been very inspiring to witness the many actions service people are taking to support and care for each other, demonstrating creativity, flexibility and commitment, truly P&G people at their best. Turning to product availability. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. Our products clean your laundry, your home, your hair, your body, your hands, and we clean and shave your face. We provide hygiene products for feminine protection, Baby Care, adult incontinence and bathroom needs. Hair Care, shampoos to clean hair and conditioners and treatments to improve hair health. Facial cleansers, body wash, hand soaps and antiperspirants deodorants address additional hygiene needs. Our OTC health care products provide proactive health benefits as well as important symptom relief. These products are more important than ever, given the needs presented by the current crisis. The increased awareness around health and hygiene and the additional time we\u2019re all spending -- many of us are spending at home. Consumption of hand soaps has obviously increased. Consumers in the U.S. are doing more laundry loads per week and washing more garments after wearing them just once. More loads are being done with unit dose detergents. We\u2019ve seen a spike in demand for Tide antibacterial spray. This care consumption has increased as families eat more meals at home and are more concerned about the hygiene of their dishes, glasses and silverware. More meals at home means more surface cleaning, often with a preference for a disposable cleaning solution versus a funky sponge, dingy cloth or suspect mop, leading to increased consumption of Bounty Swiffer and Mr. Clean. In late February, we launched Microban 24, an antimicrobial technology that keeps surfaces sanitized for up to 24 hours, when used as directed. The power behind Microban 24 is a multilayer protective shield that binds the bacteria-fighting ingredient to the surface that\u2019s been cleaned, even when contacted multiple times, helping homes stay cleaner and more hygienic, longer. We\u2019ve been working lockstep with governments around the world to make sure we can continue to operate, enabling us to help people and their families meet their health hygiene and cleaning needs. Our operations have been resilient. As of today, our 108 manufacturing plants along with our network of external suppliers are broadly operational with only a few at modified capacity as a result of regulation, workforce, travel restrictions, curfews, material availability or quarantine needs. March was a true test for our product supply planning and logistics organization, which they passed with flying colors. We set records for volume of product produced and shipped. Our largest five North American plants produced and shipped 22% more cases in March than the average of the prior 12 months. The P&G supply organization delivered similar records across Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world, incredibly impressive. Moving to the next priority. P&G has a long history of supporting communities in times of need with the products we produce and other forms of support. P&G donations of product and cash are significant and will continue to increase as we work with communities around the world to support their efforts to help people through this crisis. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure that families have basic access to the everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We\u2019re partnering to provide additional support with some of the world\u2019s leading relief organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross Americares and Direct Relief and key regional organizations such as Feeding America, Matthew 25: Ministries, the Child and Youth Development Foundation, One Foundation, the Korea Disaster Relief Association, the United Way and many others. We\u2019re working to protect health care workers and first responders. United States Center for Disease Control has issued the guidance recommending proper shaving when wearing N95 and similar respiratory masks in order to ensure proper mask fit for maximum protection. Gillette has donated razors around the world to hospitals and other facilities to protect the people working to care for others. We\u2019ve modified equipment to produce hand sanitizer in nearly a dozen manufacturing sites around the world, using it to ensure our people can continue to operate safely and sharing it with hospitals, health care facilities, and relief organizations. Colleagues in our Gattatico plant in Italy volunteered to create an extra shift to produce surface cleaning and sanitizing products that are being donated to 70 hospitals across that country. Work is underway to produce critically needed nonmedical facemasks. We\u2019re already up and running in China and the U.S. and we currently have teams working to solve additional capacity in every region of the world and will quickly begin production in those areas in coming weeks. When fully operational, we expect to be producing more than 10 million masks per month. We\u2019ve leveraged P&G R&D, engineering and manufacturing capability to quickly produce face shields in Boston and Cincinnati, which are currently being used in hospitals and COVID-19 testing centers. We\u2019re using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees, maximizing availability of products and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. Our strategic choices remain the right ones and serve each of these priorities: A portfolio of daily use products, many providing health hygiene and cleaning benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice; superior science-based products delivered with superior packaging and retail execution; consumer communication and value in all price tiers where we compete. As you know, we\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth including margin expansion, each underscore the continued importance of productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program, cost productivity and cash up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In this environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both produce even helping more, what new needs must we meet and what new ways, an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility. Our new organization structure, six industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focus markets and enterprise markets, and very small corporate groups with best-in-class function expertise is serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy following to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we\u2019ve made to focus and strengthen our portfolio and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to establish and extend the superiority of our brands to make productivity is integral to our culture as innovation, to leave constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. As we said at CAGNY, the best response to the uncertainties and sources of volatility we face is to double down on this integrated set of strategies, which are delivering very strong results. These integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies are a foundation for strong balanced growth and value-creation. The best response to what we are challenged with today is to push forward, not to pull back, and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do. I want to now describe how this approach has played out in the quarter we just completed and how we think it could play out across both, the longer term and the arguably more challenging short to mid-term. First, as I\u2019ve said, strong results in the January to March quarter. When we spoke with you at the CAGNY conference on February 20th, we said that results for the January to March quarter in China and for the total Company will be materially impacted on both the top and bottom-line by the dynamics affecting the market in China. Remember at that point in time, COVID-19 was really just a China and travel retail issue. Korea had reported only 50 cases. The U.S., Japan, Italy and Iran combined had reported only 30 cases, 15 and 10, 3 and 2, respectively. At CAGNY, we were internally expecting organic sales in Greater China, our second largest and second most profitable market to be down as much as 20%. Through the incredible efforts of our organization, we did much better than we were expecting in Greater China, down only 8%, excluding travel retail. We saw a strong lift in our categories in e-commerce that make up a portion of sales lost in closed physical stores. We quickly restored production capability, built share as a result and are now operating at very close to full strength. As the pandemic unfortunately developed in the U.S. and Europe as the quarter progressed, demand surged. We finished the quarter with organic sales growth of 10% in the U.S., 14% in Canada, 6% in European focus markets, 15% in European enterprise markets and 11% in Latin America. At CAGNY, we were internally projecting Q3 organic sales growth for the Company of around 2%, we delivered 6% with 9 of 10 categories growing organic sales. We built aggregate share, despite temporary out-of-stocks in some of our highest demand items. While we don\u2019t have final U.S. all-outlet share through March, share results and track channels through March show broad-based growth. Vicks respiratory products were up more than 4 points, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol up 3 points. Olay moisturizers and Oral-B power toothbrushes up more than 2 points; Always Pads Always Discreet, Tampax, Tide, Dawn, Cascade and Gillette blades and razors each up 1 point or more; Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Native, Secret, Crest, Mr. Clean, Gain and Bounce, each growing share. As you can see in the track channel data, our share declined recently in baby and Family Care categories, due largely to out-of-stocks on our high demand brands. We\u2019re pushing production to its limits but we expect share softness to continue while consumer pantry stocking remains at extreme levels. In China, we built share in offline stores and in e-commerce. Safeguard and Gillette delivered strong share performance in both channels. Head & Shoulders is particularly strong offline in a way Whisper and Pampers posted solid online share growth. Top line results this quarter obviously benefited from consumer pantry loading in preparation for in-home quarantining. We\u2019re planning for pantry inventory levels to eventually return to normal. This higher level of consumer demand was served with our ramp-up and production levels and the depletion of retailer inventories. As at-home inventory decreases, we expect to refill the retail inventory pipeline. We believe the net effect of all of this shifted about 2 points of sales growth on a global basis from Q4 into Q3. Back to CAGNY, we were expecting a slight decline in core earnings per share for the quarter. We delivered instead a $1.17 per share, an increase of 10%. The significant volume of sales increase, related fixed cost leverage and our ongoing productivity efforts more than offset a growing FX challenge and higher virus-related operational costs. Commodities also provided a benefit. Core gross margin up 120 basis points, excluding currency up 130. Core operating margin up 100 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin up 180 basis points. Core earnings per share up 10%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%. $4.1 billion in operating cash flow, adjusted free cash flow productivity at 113%, returning $2.8 billion in cash to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchase. So, January-March, 6% organic sales growth, 10% core earnings per share growth, 113% free cash flow productivity building share. Fiscal year-to-date, 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth, over 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity building share. Just two days ago, we announced a 6% increase in our dividend, reflecting both, these results and the confidence we have in our future. This was the 64th consecutive annual increase and the 130th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, that\u2019s January through March and fiscal year-to-date, very strong results in very difficult conditions. Shifting to longer term, we remain well-positioned to serve consumers and create value in a very attractive industry. And as I said previously, our strategy to do this is unwavering. Consumption of our products is not likely to dissipate. In fact, the relevance of our categories and consumers\u2019 lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered health hygiene and cleaning focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be an increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home, more cleaning of homes with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There\u2019s potential for increased preference for established, reputable, dependable brands that solve newly framed problems better than other alternatives, potentially less experimentation. Potential for a lasting shift for e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. Increased demand has focused retailers on the core SKUs that drive the business. There\u2019s potential for this to result in a cutting of the long tail of inefficient SKUs and brands in our categories. We\u2019re discovering daily lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today\u2019s necessity birthing the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity rocket booster on the factory floor and in the office environment. So, in the longer term, we believe we are relatively well-positioned to serve consumers\u2019 heightened needs and their changing behavior to serve the needs of our retail and distributor partners across channels and geographies and to create value. In the short to midterm, outcomes are frankly anyone\u2019s guess. Epidemiologists will have wide variations in their best and worst case scenarios for viral spread, mortality, the shape and duration of the curve. We may see months of sporadic production suspension due to local quarantines or raw material supply. It\u2019s not just our operations that matter here. It\u2019s those of our suppliers, of contractors and of our transportation partners. A lot must go right in a very challenging environment and not all of it will. Customers may close stores. There will continue to be extreme foreign exchange and commodity costs volatility. Added operational complexity will result in higher costs. Unemployment will impact outcomes, perhaps severely. All of this occurs on top of what was already unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in our categories and markets. But, as you saw in the development of the business in just five weeks from CAGNY to March 31st and as we\u2019ve just talked about in our long-term outlook where there\u2019s volatility, there are opportunities to serve as well as challenges. There\u2019s a very wide range of possible near-term scenarios and it\u2019s futile to spend too much time trying to assign probabilities to each. We\u2019d be fooling ourselves and fooling you to try. As we stand here today though, we continue to believe our guidance ranges for the fiscal year on both the top and bottom lines remain relevant. Our internal forecasts remain within these ranges. But, I must again emphasize ranges and I must again emphasize the degree of uncertainty and volatility we face day to day. We currently expect organic sales growth for the year in the range of 4% to 5%, assuming continued operations in our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers. On the bottom line, we\u2019re forecasting core earnings per share growth in the range of 8% to 11% for the year. This tool assumes no significant interruption in the extended supply chain through to our retail and distributor partners. This earnings per share range now includes over $400 million of after tax foreign exchange headwinds. Just since CAGNY, FX has moved against us by approximately $0.10 per share, over 2 percentage points for core earnings per share growth on the year. And the fourth quarter FX is currently forecast to be a 7-point hit to core earnings per share growth. Please recall that our fourth quarter bottom line comps include the earnings gains from the Boston land sale and the divestiture of two Oral Care brands in the base period. These items combined are an additional 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth, Q4. While we do expect some midterm benefit in commodity costs from the recent decline in oil prices, it usually takes about six months for movements in feedstocks like oil to make their way through the raw material supply chain and our inventories to our P&L. That we don\u2019t expect to offset to FX headwinds from lower commodity costs within this fiscal year. As a result of all of this, you might likely guess that we\u2019re closer as we talk today to the bottom end of the earnings per share guidance range than the top end. But, we also go back quickly to our priorities and note that none of the three include hitting quarterly consensus estimates. We will be focused on serving colleagues, consumers, customers, communities, building our business for the many more months that will follow this crisis than the months that will exist within it. But we\u2019ll do this responsibly and keep our choices squarely centered on mid and long-term value-creation. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 100%. We\u2019ll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends, share repurchase in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. We\u2019ll provide our first outlook for fiscal 2021 on our year-end call as we typically do in July. Before turning to your questions, I want to address just two items I expect are on your minds. The first is liquidity. Our liquidity status remains very strong. We are a 183-year old company this year and we take a long-term view to balance sheet management. We aim to maintain our AA minus credit rating and to manage within the ratios that support that rating. With a $5 billion term issue three weeks ago at approximately 3%, we now have $15 billion in cash on hand and are generating more each day. We continue to have open access to the U.S. commercial paper markets, recently issuing over $3 billion on three months paper as a part of our routine financing efforts. The amount of debt maturing in the next 18 months is well within anticipated cash availability. And while we don\u2019t expect to need to draw on them, we have $8 billion in bank credit lines available if needed. That\u2019s credit, very strong. The second topic is recession. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s already here and will be here for some period of time. While we are not immune, our current strategy puts us on better footing than prior downturns to weather economic headwinds. Our portfolio is now focused on daily use items where performance drives brand choice. We have much less exposure to discretionary items than we had during the last downturn. We\u2019ve increased the superiority of our offerings, simultaneously increasing their value. While not perfect, we had stronger entries across price peers, better pricing ladders. We\u2019re emphasizing performance-based value messaging. We will serve with relevant pack sizes designed to hit key cash outlay thresholds for consumers who need to make week-to-week purchase decisions based on cash availability. Our productivity muscle is now well developed. None of these make us recession-proof, but they should each help. Summing up, the men and women at P&G working together to deliver three very strong quarters, averaging 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth and over a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, we\u2019ve built market share. Our Board has increased the dividend 6%, reflecting both strong results and confidence in the future. We really do believe there is a very bright future ahead. We\u2019ll manage the short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve health, hygiene and cleaning needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We\u2019re stepping forward, not back. We\u2019re doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We\u2019re doing this in our interest and society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. While we may not see you in person soon, we look forward to engaging with you on the phone and would love to hear your voice. We are here with you and are here for you. Feel free to call our offices as you normally would, our phones. You know where to find us. And with that, I\u2019ll be happy to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nSteve Powers: Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the comprehensive update. Clearly, a ton of questions. I guess, maybe we could start with just a little more detail on what you\u2019re expecting in terms of the shape of demand, both consumption and shipment wise as we head into the fourth quarter, especially in the U.S. where it appears shipments lag. Consumption in the March period, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting a reversal of that in the coming quarters. Just some more color there, as well as China, where as you say things seem better, on trend versus where you thought they\u2019d be in February. And then, I\u2019m also curious, just building on your final comments there around preparedness for coming recession. I guess, if you think about where you are in your fiscal \u201821 planning process, could you just give us a little insight as to how -- clearly this has been an abrupt change, but in terms P&G\u2019s planning preparedness, how recessionary planning has factored into your thinking more on a run rate basis? Like, are you -- I guess, the question from investors is, are you scrambling to put in place the recession playbook or is this something that P&G has been factoring in and considering for some time? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Steve. As it relates to the fourth quarter, there are, as you readily appreciate, a ton of moving parts. Geographies are in very different places in the cycle, categories have different levels of need and demand. There\u2019s the supply situation and then there is the retail inventory dynamics as well as consumer pantry dynamics. And again, you multiply that by a 100 countries around the world and 10 categories and many more brands and you realize that you probably don\u2019t have the answer. As we were sitting together at CAGNY five weeks ago, I don\u2019t think any of us in our conversations would have assumed how the next five weeks would unfold. And I don\u2019t pretend to know how the next 8 to 10 weeks is going to unfold. Having said that, you mentioned China. Our business there is rebounding nicely, both from an operations standpoint and from a consumption standpoint. We are seeing a continued significant demand in our categories and the supply and retail inventories are being steadily rebuilt. In the U.S., -- and I focus on these two markets because as you know, they are our largest markets, so to give you some relative feel. April has started off very strong double digit rates from an order standpoint. We expect that to tail off as the lines are set between retail inventory, restocking and consumer demand. But having said that, we are definitely seeing increased consumption levels, not just increased buying levels to put in pantries. I mentioned that in the U.S. we\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of loads of laundry that are done per week, the number of garments that are cleaned after one wearing. With much more in-home meal preparation, there\u2019s a lot more cleaning that needs to be done. And we\u2019re seeing consumption, for example at-home consumption of cleaning aids,, whether that\u2019s surface cleaners or paper towels or Swiffer continuing to be very, very strong. Our Home Care business, if I have my numbers right, was double digits in sales and that\u2019s following or in line with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of consumption. Now, having said all that, and sorry for the long answer but there\u2019s no short one. We have never faced the level of unemployment that we\u2019re likely to see in this country and potentially in others. And we don\u2019t know how long that will occur for. We\u2019ve never faced a complete shutdown of very important channels of commerce, whether that\u2019s travel retail, whether that\u2019s the electric channel in Europe, whether that\u2019s the specialty beauty channel. So, there\u2019s a huge amount of volatility we\u2019re likely to experience and we\u2019ll learn more every day. Our fourth quarter sales guidance, deductively, given fiscal year-to-date results and our fiscal year guidance is minus 2 to plus 2. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 was about 2 points. So, that minus 2 to plus 2 on an apples-to-apples basis is really zero to 4. And while that may not seem like a lot, given a 6 year-to-date, recall again a number of things. One, it\u2019s our highest comp period. So, last year, organic sales by quarter were 4, 4, 5 and 7. 2 will have a full quarter of the impact of these channel closures and store closures. 3 will have the inventory dynamics, however, those net out that I described. So, when you put all that together, zero to 4, accurate, I doubt it, but it\u2019s representative of the combination of all those dynamics. So, it\u2019s the best number we have. And again, I apologize for the length of this answer, but it\u2019s not a topic that lends itself to simple formula. On recession and recessionary playbook, I really do believe that we have made major steps as a company since the last recession that significantly improve our hand, whether that\u2019s productivity, whether that\u2019s a focus on superiority, which is critical, because certainly price points matter and we\u2019re prepared to address that. But overall, value proposition really matters. And at a time when there\u2019s heightened concern about the need for a product to work and be efficacious, as I take care of my family and my home, the superiority plays an even bigger role.  So, the changes we\u2019ve made there I think will put us in much better stead. I talked about the portfolio and the difference and the preponderance of our product serving needs on a daily basis versus much more discretionary portfolio and not daily use based in some categories that we\u2019ve divested. So, this is a playbook that we\u2019ve been developing for both good times and bad times, month-by-month, year-by-year. And I really do believe we\u2019re in a better position. Having said that, when something significant like this happens, would it be right to sit back and assume that we\u2019ve got it covered? No. So, we are making very deliberate plans business by business, market by market to ensure we\u2019re as well positioned as we can be. And there will be changes and there will be adjustments, and they won\u2019t always be right, and we\u2019ll have to remain agile and learn and adjusted as we go.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Hi, Jon. I was hoping you could talk a little bit. You mentioned that you are focusing your production on kind of key SKUs, starting to talk about thinking through changes in pack size and affordability. But, I was also wondering about promotional spending. We\u2019ve heard certainly from some of the food companies already just about promotion, more or less and stores being shut down U.S., and that\u2019s happening in Europe I\u2019m assuming by government mandate. So, how should we think about pricing going forward, even just from the standpoint of complete change in the promotional landscape, just normal everyday kind of stuff. So, that was one area of question. And the other thing I was curious about is we haven\u2019t talked much about emerging markets outside of China. And just thinking about as the virus presumably spreads and start to have a bigger impact in some of your enterprise skewing markets, how you are maybe planning for that or what\u2019s kind of built into the thought process beyond the next, probably a month or two on this getting worse in emerging markets?\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Lauren. The promotional dynamics in our categories are changing pretty significantly, just as they are in food and beverage, which you referenced. It\u2019s really nobody\u2019s interest to be promoting products when you don\u2019t have them, when there is not a sufficient inventory to supply demand. So, if we look at for the full quarter, the amount of volume in our categories as a percentage of sales that moved on promotion, that\u2019s down about 5 points, and obviously that number would be much more significant in the month of March. And I don\u2019t really know how that will develop going forward, but certainly, if I had to guess, there will be less promotion in the next couple of quarters where the job is restocking and replenishing than had been the case historically. Price in the quarter was a net benefit of plus 1. And if I look back over the last 30 quarters, price has typically been a benefit of 1 to 2, sometimes, very rarely, but sometimes zero or minus 1, sometimes a little bit more, in that range. But it\u2019s pretty much in that range. And as I mentioned, our strategy is unchanging. So, an innovation based strategy, I don\u2019t see any reason why there will be a dramatic change in the contribution of price, particularly also because you have significant currency devaluations in many parts of the world, where some amount of pricing will be needed over time, done appropriately and sensitively to recover cost structures in those markets. Right now, in emerging markets outside of China, we\u2019re operating and thinking rightly or wrongly, day-by-day, because situation changes dramatically. India is a good example. That market is effectively shut and will be at least through the end of April. We\u2019re working with governments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to establish the essential nature of our product categories for their citizens and therefore gain the ability to operate, which we largely have. That\u2019s been a significant focus area over the last five weeks, and it\u2019s a daily endeavor. And then, once we establish our ability to operate, we then have to source materials and we have to ensure that employees can get to work, which sounds simple, but is anything but. For example, we\u2019ll go back to India again, there is a prohibition on any transport of people across state lines. And you can imagine, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual that we might have a plant or two that are located close to a state border, and you might imagine that some of the people that work in that facility live on the other side of that line. So, that\u2019s just an example of kind of the level of operational agility that we\u2019re having to execute. In order to continue operating in the Philippines, we had to basically secure access to a dorm next to our production facility in which to house and protect employees as a condition of operating. So, we\u2019re not that far out in our thinking about how to operate in these markets. Right now, it\u2019s day-to-day.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So, I just want to spend some time on your market share expectations going forward. The comments were helpful in terms of thinking about a recession. Obviously, you guys have had a lot of market share momentum over the last couple of years, particularly in the U.S. Can you just discuss the forward puts and takes, as you think about a post-COVID environment, all your market share. And specifically, what I was most interested in was consumer trade-down risk in your mind and then also in emerging markets as you think about covering FX pressure there with pricing, relative to local competition. Can you talk about how market share dynamics would play into your thought process there? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Some real positive developments from a market share standpoint as I walked you through over the last quarter, and no reason for those underlying trends, not to continue, particularly when they\u2019re based on again, performance advantages at a time when performance is required more than ever. Will there be a trade down pressure? I don\u2019t know, but I think it would be silly to assume none. And will there be some share pressure as a result of pricing moves that need to be made? Undoubtedly that we\u2019re going to be very careful in terms of pricing that we do take in emerging markets and will likely tie that much more closely to local inflation than we would to the financial markets and currency and as a result should encounter fewer issues relative to competition than we would if we were just pricing to the currency conversion number. The biggest pressure on shares in the near term is none of any of that. It\u2019s the ability to supply very, very high levels of demand in some categories. I mentioned two categories in our prepared remarks, Family Care, which is our Bounty and Charmin business, and Baby Care. And let me just describe briefly some of the dynamics that occur in the Family Care category as an example. We can see a scenario where our business continues to grow at strong double digit rates and we lose share. That\u2019s because the market is growing at an even higher rate than that. Many of our competitors in that business source the industrial or commercial market, as well as the consumer market. Our business is entirely focused on the consumer market. Those companies have the ability with what is largely a shuttered hospitality industry as an example, to move production from an industrial or commercial focus to a consumer focus. You don\u2019t have that excess capacity to make that move. So, our throughput is up significantly on a per line basis. The results are going to be very, very good. But, we will probably, in that context, lose some share. So, what I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward, and I\u2019m -- here I\u2019m talking about the next three to six months is a continued steady increase in share levels. But, I also wouldn\u2019t expect significant diminution of our position. We\u2019re committed to not have that happen. We talk about that actively. But, there will be more volatility in the share numbers just because of all of the market dynamics that we\u2019re trying to manage.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nQ - Wendy Nicholson: Two question. First, pretty straight forward on Microban. It seems like great timing to have launched that, but I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t expanded it to more a consumer centered business as opposed to professional. So, any plans there? I also noticed that you don\u2019t sell Microban rights, which seems like a category that\u2019s just going to be bigger and grow there for a long time to come. So, can you just comment on why or why not you might enter that category? And then, can you talk about just e-commerce generally? I assume servicing the e-commerce channel is no different than servicing other brick-and-mortar retailers. But maybe can you talk about -- I don\u2019t know that I heard how much it grew in the quarter or what percentage of business it was in the quarter, especially in the U.S.? Thanks so much.\nA - Jon Moeller: Sure, Wendy. Let me start with the second part of your question. The e-commerce business grew about -- globally about 35% in the quarter. It\u2019s now about 10% of our business globally. As we\u2019ve talked many times previously, we view ourselves as very well positioned within that channel and continue to strengthen that position. The two largest sources of growth by far are the U.S. and China with some categories growing in e-commerce in those two markets, as much as 50%. And obviously the at-home dynamics and the unwillingness to congregate in physical stores is driving a fair amount of that. We\u2019ll have to see where that nets out, but I don\u2019t think it all goes away. I think, we\u2019ve seen a permanent shift in the percentage of business that\u2019s going to be done in e-commerce and we view that positively. And when I talk about e-commerce, I\u2019m talking broadly including omni-channel, click and pick, and all forms and varieties of e-commerce. Microban is a wonderful, fantastic product. We were serendipitous in terms of our launch timing. We are at full capacity at this point and are focused on the products we currently have in markets and the channels that we\u2019re currently operating in. But obviously, we\u2019ll work to develop that business to its full potential and that could include a number of different avenues of pursuit.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Two questions here. How does it change how you think about new product rollout timing? Do some ideas get backtracked while others get pushed out promotion strategies, how you market and build trial, because obviously market advisors can\u2019t really do their job right now? And then, secondly, in terms of margins, how does the current environment sort of help or hurt the margins? Because the categories that are moving are typically lower margin, but commodities have obviously come down and promotion isn\u2019t quite as necessary in many of these categories in the near term. But on the other hand, FX is worse and we expect it to some trade down. So, just those two areas, if you could elaborate on both, that would be great. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: So, we obviously saw a positive margin development in the quarter we just completed. We\u2019ve seen positive margin development fiscal year-to-date. Our guidance would imply positive margin development for the fiscal year. And as we talk about balance growth and value-creation, I\u2019ve explained many times, but it\u2019s not possible to get to where we want to get from a value-creation standpoint without strong top line growth and margin improvement. Yes, there are some headwinds but there are also tailwinds, commodities as you mentioned, should be a tailwind longer term. And we\u2019ve got our -- we continue our efforts on our productivity program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s additional learning that\u2019s come out of our experience the last five weeks on ways we might be even more productive, both in generating top line sales and in containing cost. So, my expectation there is that there continues to be a level of margin improvement going forward. In terms of product launch and we\u2019re in the middle now of going through each category and determining are there any changes that need to be made, either out of necessity or by design to maximize the impact of those planned initiatives. And in terms of how products are brought to market, I don\u2019t see really significant changes. For example, there\u2019s more media consumption that\u2019s occurring right now than probably there has been in the last three or four years. So, changing that model doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense. And by media, I\u2019m talking about not just TV but digital consumption as well. So, I don\u2019t see significant changes there. I think, our model with some adjustments will continue to be relevant and effective. And then, we just need to look at timing by initiative there. I wouldn\u2019t expect a net of that exercise either to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to grow.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.\nSteve Strycula: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on being able to raise the dividend in a period of time like this and deliver consistency in results. Jon, I have a question. I appreciate that the Company\u2019s pivoted and evolved this portfolio to more daily use products over the last decade. But, could you help us for the products that you still have in today\u2019s portfolio? How did the organic sales really perform during the financial crisis for those products that are still in the portfolio today? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nJon Moeller: I don\u2019t have a category by category analysis of that. I just haven\u2019t had the time to get to that, although it\u2019s a very good question. But, what we do know and we refreshed learning on over the last five weeks is what\u2019s happened to market sizes in our categories during times of recession. And as you\u2019ll readily understand, our categories are not immune from recessionary impacts, but they\u2019re much less sensitive to that dynamic and most other categories across industry. And so, if we look at recessionary periods, the market has typically contracted in terms of its growth rate. So, it\u2019s continued to grow, but has contracted maybe 1 point. So, then the question becomes, okay, one, can we do anything about that if we can. Two, what\u2019s your relative position within that market and are you well-positioned to at least hold your ground if not build your position? And again, I feel better about that than I have at any time in our recent history. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be categories that from a market standpoint aren\u2019t impacted with more than others. And that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be individual situations typically at a brand or category country level. In fact do lose some share. But, I mean, put it this way, as we think about our planning for next year, we\u2019re not giving ourselves any break relative to share. We expect to hold and build share.\nSteve Strycula: Thanks for that. And then, a quick follow-up. For emerging markets, I\u2019m not asking about the month of April. We\u2019re taking a longer-term view here. But, in a marketplace where maybe some of the points of distribution are temporary shuttered and consumers are being impacted by the macro, can you expect that volumetrically, household, personal care products as an industry should be able to grow during a period like this of volatility. And what can you guys do within Procter\u2019s capability to be able to execute under that type of environment? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Absolutely, we should expect growth in these markets, absent physical barriers, either regulations or operational barriers that prevent products from getting first into stores and into markets and into consumers\u2019 hands. It\u2019s not necessarily a harbinger of the future, but I mentioned Latin America as an example growing 11% in the last quarter. The fundamental drivers of that demand remain as we go forward. In terms of our ability to capture those opportunities, our strategy in emerging markets is fundamentally the same and it\u2019s been working very, very well from both the top line standpoint and a bottom-line standpoint. By the same, I mean, our focus on superior products in daily use categories where performance means brand choice, delivered as productively as we can, and we still have lots of opportunities to improve in that context. With excellent communication, best-in-class go-to-market execution, the playbook is the same and works in enterprise markets.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning folks. Thank for sliding me in. Jon, you\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and I appreciate the thoroughness. I\u2019d love just to dive into a couple of business in a little more depth as possible. First, you mentioned that travel retail has been a bit more challenging. Can you contextualize how large is it for you as a percentage of sales and how it performed last quarter and what you\u2019ve seen more recently? And secondly, in terms of results, Grooming was a bit of a surprise to me. And you in mentioned in the press release some weakness in North America. Maybe I missed it, but I don\u2019t think you covered off on it in prepared remarks. Can you touch on what\u2019s happening in the Grooming business, please?\nJon Moeller: Let me start in a slightly different place, but I will get to your end points. The Beauty business generally and which is a primary business that\u2019s sold in travel retail, continues to perform very strongly. We hit our 17th quarter of organic -- consecutive of organic sales growth in Beauty in what is arguably the most difficult quarter we faced in a long, long time, really significant and positive growth across almost all parts of the portfolio. So, we overcame in the quarter a greater than 20% reduction in SK-II sales with solid growth in our other categories. The travel retail business specifically is round number, is a $1 billion business that\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone because there\u2019s no travel. Having said that that -- the products that were brought in travel retail were consumed in markets and our job needs to be to make up for that travel retail loss in the near term by serving those markets. And we are for example, seeing significant uptake already on SK-II consumption purchase in mainland China, which was one of the big sources of the travel retail demand. So, generally, are performing very, very well in Beauty. And we\u2019ll continue to -- the SK-II impact will have a full quarter now going forward for the next three quarters in all likelihood. So, the challenge will become greater in terms of overcoming that. But, we\u2019re in a pretty good position to be able to at least make progress in that direction. From a Grooming standpoint, we don\u2019t share during the quarter on global basis, which is great, and follows on a number of periods in a row now of share growth for the global Grooming business. The biggest challenge we face on -- we face two challenges in Grooming currently. One is, which I just -- actually I don\u2019t even know I talked about it here, doesn\u2019t matter, is the closing of the electric channel in Europe where a large amount of Braun products were sold. That also affects, by the way our power Oral Care business, which also utilizes our channel. But presumably, as soon as that reopens, which hopefully will be soon, that challenge dissipates. The other challenge is lower shave frequency while working from home, to put it bluntly. But, that\u2019s something where we\u2019re currently working through. As I said, we\u2019ve built share, we want to maintain our share position. We need to work with our retail partners as well who have in some cases, de-prioritized grooming in the very near term to deal with the empty shelves and some of the other aisles of the store. If we can do that effectively, no reason we can\u2019t continue to hold and build share.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thanks. And I wish you continued health, to all of you on this call. Jon, I appreciate the bridge of underlying zero to 4% globally. And just to think about the puts and takes by region, what are you seeing in terms of the pickup in China? And I think you alluded a little bit on the call, an improvement in Beauty and Baby there. And do you expect, by my math, 80 basis points drag in the third quarter? It seems flat in the fourth, and be above the zero to 4 range that is implied. And also a question on mix, which is the improvement in skincare globally in China coming back help the mix effect, which I think was flat in the quarter just concluded but typically was up 50 to 100 basis points in the past. Thank you.\nA - Jon Moeller: So, definitely relative to the quarter that we just completed, China offers upside quarter-to-quarter sequentially, and I expect that upside is significant. I would see us growing that business ideally at very healthy levels, at pre-crisis levels ideally in the subsequent quarter, which you\u2019re right, would get -- give a lift to the zero to 4 kind of logic. We are seeing, at least in China, mix come back in pre-crisis levels from a positive standpoint. I mentioned the strength of the SK-II restart as an example. So, that also is a positive. But remember, we have massive challenge ahead of us collectively in the U.S. and Europe, depending on how the economy develops. I mean, we literally sense the Great Depression had not managed with the level of unemployment we might see. So, the question behind your question is, is there upside to the zero to 4, I would encourage you not to go there.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Jon, it\u2019s pretty clear looking at the data that consumers are migrating back to big brands. Now, that could be because of availability or just safety and comfort in there in what they\u2019re getting. But I\u2019m just curious on two fronts. One is, kind of as you\u2019ve been interacting with retailers, how do you think this is all going to shake out in terms of how they think about taking on the brand? I think, you made some comments earlier in the prepared remarks on that. But, any specifics would be helpful. And then, the second thing is, there\u2019s a lot of trials happening right now for a lot of brands that maybe consumers may not have tried and some of your brands. And so, I was just thinking about proactively like what Procter & Gamble could do to kind of create stickiness with some of that trial going forward?\nA - Jon Moeller:\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning Jon. Congratulations on the strong quarter, particularly in the current environment. Jon, I wanted to come back to longer term implications for consumer behavior, given the nature of the current recession, increased working from home and social distancing, and what this is going to mean longer term. You touched on some of this, so positive for cleaning products and Fabric Care, potentially negative for categories like blades and beauty for people working from home. So, I wanted to come back to this. As you see it, what are the longer term implications versus those that are more transitory? How are those conversations going internally? How is the organization balancing near-term objectives given the challenges in the current environment versus potentially modulating the playbook here a bit with what could be longer term structural changes to demand in some of these categories? So, additional thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks Jon.\nJon Moeller: We need to stay very close to consumers and their habits, needs and desires more now than ever. Just because we\u2019re at change points in their habits and their consumption levels, and we need to understand those and be responsive to those. We actually meet as a portion of the leadership group three mornings a week at 7 o\u2019clock. And one of the things that we\u2019re very focused on in that meeting is, what is changing relative to consumer need and making sure, I mentioned SKU portfolio is one example, but making sure that we\u2019re positioning ourselves to serve those changing needs as well as we possibly can. I think, the net in terms of demand impact on our total portfolio is clearly a positive longer term. And I don\u2019t -- and when I say that I almost -- I don\u2019t want to minimize for a second any amount of human suffering that\u2019s led to the situation. But, we are seeing increased levels of consumption in the majority of our product categories. Even when we come to something like Beauty, remember, I talked about how this is a 17th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth in a row. And to get to organic sales growth on Beauty with a minus 20%-plus number on SK-II, you have to assume very healthy purchase and consumption levels across the portfolio, which we\u2019re seeing. And I don\u2019t see a reason that that wanes. So, generally, thank you for pointing again to the long-term, which we view as -- we want to -- it\u2019s trite and overused statement, but we really do expect to come out of this stronger than we went into it. We really do believe that there\u2019s a very bright future ahead. And to your point, we need to be very deliberately keeping ourselves aware of what those opportunities are and putting steps in place to be able to seize those opportunities again really under the heading of fully serving consumers.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning, Jon. I wanted to ask just briefly on private label. So, how should we be thinking about, how you\u2019re thinking about what potentially happens brands versus private label as obviously unemployment increases here. Commentary, what specific things you think we should be watching for categories that are more susceptible than others, I recall paper that\u2019s being one of those that we\u2019ve watched historically. And so, what are you concerned about? What are things we should be focused on and how do you think about that in terms of playing out this time around?\nJon Moeller: Generally -- so, let me take you through recent trends and then I realize your question was more future-focused. We\u2019re seeing modest increases in private label share in North America, at the same time that we\u2019re building significant share ourselves. We\u2019re seeing private label share declines pretty consistently in Europe at a time when we\u2019re building share there as well. We can grow our business and our share and Europe is a prime example, we\u2019ve done it for years, during the time when private label is growing. So, that\u2019s the first and very, very important point. Second, in terms of recessionary dynamics, as it relates to private label, I don\u2019t -- we see a number of different behaviors, which affect that overall equation. There are certainly a subset of consumers for whom price becomes a significantly greater portion of their personal value equation. And that will in some cases result in a trade down to private label. Our job becomes having an offering alternatives for them that allows them to achieve the same objective within our branded portfolio. And we have many more rungs in that pricing ladder now than we had during the last recession. There are other consumers who move the other way for whom performance, efficacy, dependability, I can\u2019t afford to be wrong, I can\u2019t buy two, so I need to buy the best, results in a migration to branded offerings. And that\u2019s different by category and by market. But again, going back to something we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in this call, I don\u2019t see any reason for us to have an expectation of ourselves that we hold their build share over reasonable periods of time, I mean given month or given quarter, or given category or given country will have issues. But our expectation is that, whether this is a V-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s L-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s a prolonged recession, with our portfolio as it\u2019s structured today, continued to focus on superiority, continued focus on excellence and execution, we should be able to hold and build share positions.\nOperator: The next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nBill Chappell: Two quick questions. One, I\u2019m not sure you can answer, but maybe from what you\u2019ve seen in China or what you\u2019ve seen elsewhere, I mean, if you\u2019re looking at a given category that had 10% type increase, would you say like -- is there a way to say like 5% of that is pantry stocking, 2% of that is a stay-at-home orders and then the rest is just normal growth? I mean, is there any way to look at that? And then secondly, on advertising, what\u2019s the plan in this environment? It seems like most large CPG companies have moved away from product advertising and moved more to kind of this is the company message and we\u2019re all in this together, which is great, but just didn\u2019t know if -- that the longer term it\u2019s going to change or cut back or if that\u2019s something just temporary?\nJon Moeller: So, in some categories, Bill, we have -- we do have the ability to tease out increases in consumption from pantry loading, et cetera. And for example, there are several categories in the U.S. where we have a panel of either consumers or devices, washing machines, dishwashers that give us information on a routine basis on consumption levels. And where we have that in place, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to know, for example, when I mentioned earlier, what\u2019s happening to wash frequency of clothes and what constitutes that load, the same in a dishwashing context. So, we\u2019re able to in those categories, see very clearly the increase in use and consumption and obviously then deduct into what might be pantry stocking. There are other categories where we don\u2019t have as good a visibility into that, but we\u2019re working to develop that ability across each of the categories in the major markets, and that\u2019s the clear focus. But, I would say that in general, we\u2019re seeing as much as a 20% increase in consumption across categories of where you\u2019d expect to see that and the balance is pantry to some extent. But remember also, in many of our categories, pantry availability itself leads to greater usage. I start conserving on my usage for example of paper towel or certainly of bathroom tissue as I reach the end of my inventory to defer that trip to the store and certainly avoid a situation where I don\u2019t have any available. If there is lots available, I\u2019m typically not rationing or conserving. So, just having it there results in increased consumption in many of our categories. I\u2019m not the expert in the company on advertising, but I would offer a couple of thoughts. Helping consumers understand how they can meet their own perceived and critical needs for them and their family through the use of our products and many categories is a public service. And as well for many years, well before this, we focused on, if you will, both. Think about the Always Like a Girl campaign as an example. And done well, you can do both simultaneously. But, again, I\u2019m not the advertising expert. If you want more perspective on that, feel free to call my friend Marc Pritchard.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. And, Jon, thank you to you and your colleagues for all the things that you\u2019re doing to make Procter & Gamble increasingly indispensable. Two questions. First, clearly e-commerce is becoming increasingly important, obviously in the U.S. and in China. Can you talk about the things that you are doing to become increasingly advantaged and meet the needs of your e-commerce partners in the U.S. and China, and maybe what your market share looks like in e-commerce versus brick and mortar in the U.S. and China? And then, the second question, obviously 6% increase in the dividend is impressive. But, I think what would be most interesting for me is to understand the thought process in that increase, given your very clear eye view of the sorts of challenges that the world faces over the next 12-plus months. So, how did Procter & Gamble think about that sort of increase in that context? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Let me start with the second question. We have a very simple philosophy and belief, which is that the cash we generate is not ours, it\u2019s yours. And we have -- that\u2019s of course after meeting the needs of -- and opportunities that are presented by attractive investments. We\u2019re having a good year. And if we deliver against our guidance, it\u2019ll be 8% to 11% core earnings per share growth, operating earnings growth has been pretty much in line with that. And going back to the philosophy and the commitments, that results in a certain outcome. Our business is generally highly cash generative. So, I mentioned we generated $4.1 billion of cash in the quarter. Our payout ratio, with the move we\u2019ve just made is a little bit under 60%. So, there\u2019s plenty of room there, if you will. So, it really stems from our philosophy and our commitment and our result and the cash generative nature of our business. And I don\u2019t expect that to change going forward. Obviously, in extreme situations, we might come to a different conclusion. But so far we\u2019ve been weathering this situation fairly well and expect to do well as we go forward. I might also just comment on the general topic of capital allocation. I started receiving some questions on share repurchase and whether that\u2019s appropriate use of funds in this environment. And I don\u2019t fully understand the question. I do, if you\u2019re accepting government support or something like that. But again, going back to our philosophy, that\u2019s your cash, not our cash that needs to come back to you, either through a dividend or share repurchase. And probably, the worst thing we could do at this period of time when I go back to our priorities, the third one being to help society get through this crisis is take a bunch of cash and sit on it. We\u2019re much better off, I think, returning that cash to society and helping people, during a very difficult time. And as you know, we have a large percentage of retail share owners, individual people, and we have a large ownership position from pension funds, which are representing the needs and wants and dreams or desires of frontline healthcare workers, firemen, policemen, of the bus driver, of teachers. And so, I don\u2019t see any reason not to maintain the stance we\u2019ve taken for many, many years relative to cash return. And I think it\u2019s more vital now than ever. Sorry. I got kind of waylaid on that point, but it\u2019s what I feel strongly about. Relative to e-commerce, it differs pretty widely by category, by country. But, generally, our market shares in e-commerce, our online shares are equal to our offline share or slightly ahead. And also, our margins are generally in line, online and offline. In general, the things that we do to win and best serve consumers offline are relevant online as well. But, there are some specific things we can do to better serve both online shoppers and online retailers, for example, with packaging that\u2019s designed to survive the e-commerce journey, which was physically very demanding, and we\u2019re working to develop proprietary packaging that improves packaging integrity and consumer experience in that specific channel. So, there are channel specific areas of superiority that we can help our customers be relevant and in the process increase our relevance.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nJon Moeller: Thanks everybody. Stay well, stay safe. We\u2019re here. Don\u2019t hesitate to call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. I'm here at home by myself coming to you through my cell phone. John Chevalier is at his home and is prepared to jump in if for any reason my connection fails and I can't reestablish it. We're all going through a difficult and challenging time. And I want to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and are well. Thank you for joining us on accelerated timing. Our motivation in advancing the timing of this release was simply transparency, giving information to you and to the market as quickly as possible. We've had a very strong quarter, but I'm going to start by outlining our priorities in the crisis period. These have been and will continue to guide our actions and our choices. I'll then move quickly to strategy, which remains unwavering. I'll discuss actual and potential results for three time periods, the quarter we just completed, which as I said was strong; the long-term on the backside of this crisis; and then, the short to midterm as we all work our way through this. Following this, I'll answer a couple of anticipated questions and then turn to additional questions that are on your or your clients' minds. Our first priority in this crisis is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. Second, we're maximizing the availability of products that help people and their families with their health hygiene and cleaning needs, which has never been greater. The next priority is helping society meet and overcome the challenges we all face. Taken together, these priorities help ensure P&G is there, there for employees, there for consumers, there for communities who have always been there for us. Let me briefly discuss each of these priorities in turn. Employee safety and health. With guidance from medical professionals, we're constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This includes temperature scans, shift rotations, queuing avoidance and physical distancing. We're performing comprehensive methodical cleaning of all production areas including regular sanitization and surface disinfection that exceeds the most rigorous health authority standards. We're also equipping and encouraging all employees to make smart appropriate choices, such as staying at home if they feel unwell or part of high risk groups or have preexisting medical conditions. In all cases, we're partnering with our colleagues individually and proactively to ensure they feel and are protected and safe. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand. Our industry-leading benefits plans play a critical role in providing P&G people with the resources they need to care for themselves and for their families. From paid leave and comprehensive medical care to flexible work arrangements and financial support, P&G people can work confidently knowing that the Company stands with and behind them. It's been very inspiring to witness the many actions service people are taking to support and care for each other, demonstrating creativity, flexibility and commitment, truly P&G people at their best. Turning to product availability. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. Our products clean your laundry, your home, your hair, your body, your hands, and we clean and shave your face. We provide hygiene products for feminine protection, Baby Care, adult incontinence and bathroom needs. Hair Care, shampoos to clean hair and conditioners and treatments to improve hair health. Facial cleansers, body wash, hand soaps and antiperspirants deodorants address additional hygiene needs. Our OTC health care products provide proactive health benefits as well as important symptom relief. These products are more important than ever, given the needs presented by the current crisis. The increased awareness around health and hygiene and the additional time we're all spending -- many of us are spending at home. Consumption of hand soaps has obviously increased. Consumers in the U.S. are doing more laundry loads per week and washing more garments after wearing them just once. More loads are being done with unit dose detergents. We've seen a spike in demand for Tide antibacterial spray. This care consumption has increased as families eat more meals at home and are more concerned about the hygiene of their dishes, glasses and silverware. More meals at home means more surface cleaning, often with a preference for a disposable cleaning solution versus a funky sponge, dingy cloth or suspect mop, leading to increased consumption of Bounty Swiffer and Mr. Clean. In late February, we launched Microban 24, an antimicrobial technology that keeps surfaces sanitized for up to 24 hours, when used as directed. The power behind Microban 24 is a multilayer protective shield that binds the bacteria-fighting ingredient to the surface that's been cleaned, even when contacted multiple times, helping homes stay cleaner and more hygienic, longer. We've been working lockstep with governments around the world to make sure we can continue to operate, enabling us to help people and their families meet their health hygiene and cleaning needs. Our operations have been resilient. As of today, our 108 manufacturing plants along with our network of external suppliers are broadly operational with only a few at modified capacity as a result of regulation, workforce, travel restrictions, curfews, material availability or quarantine needs. March was a true test for our product supply planning and logistics organization, which they passed with flying colors. We set records for volume of product produced and shipped. Our largest five North American plants produced and shipped 22% more cases in March than the average of the prior 12 months. The P&G supply organization delivered similar records across Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world, incredibly impressive. Moving to the next priority. P&G has a long history of supporting communities in times of need with the products we produce and other forms of support. P&G donations of product and cash are significant and will continue to increase as we work with communities around the world to support their efforts to help people through this crisis. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure that families have basic access to the everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We're partnering to provide additional support with some of the world's leading relief organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross Americares and Direct Relief and key regional organizations such as Feeding America, Matthew 25: Ministries, the Child and Youth Development Foundation, One Foundation, the Korea Disaster Relief Association, the United Way and many others. We're working to protect health care workers and first responders. United States Center for Disease Control has issued the guidance recommending proper shaving when wearing N95 and similar respiratory masks in order to ensure proper mask fit for maximum protection. Gillette has donated razors around the world to hospitals and other facilities to protect the people working to care for others. We've modified equipment to produce hand sanitizer in nearly a dozen manufacturing sites around the world, using it to ensure our people can continue to operate safely and sharing it with hospitals, health care facilities, and relief organizations. Colleagues in our Gattatico plant in Italy volunteered to create an extra shift to produce surface cleaning and sanitizing products that are being donated to 70 hospitals across that country. Work is underway to produce critically needed nonmedical facemasks. We're already up and running in China and the U.S. and we currently have teams working to solve additional capacity in every region of the world and will quickly begin production in those areas in coming weeks. When fully operational, we expect to be producing more than 10 million masks per month. We've leveraged P&G R&D, engineering and manufacturing capability to quickly produce face shields in Boston and Cincinnati, which are currently being used in hospitals and COVID-19 testing centers. We're using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees, maximizing availability of products and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. Our strategic choices remain the right ones and serve each of these priorities: A portfolio of daily use products, many providing health hygiene and cleaning benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice; superior science-based products delivered with superior packaging and retail execution; consumer communication and value in all price tiers where we compete. As you know, we've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth including margin expansion, each underscore the continued importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program, cost productivity and cash up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In this environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both produce even helping more, what new needs must we meet and what new ways, an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility. Our new organization structure, six industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focus markets and enterprise markets, and very small corporate groups with best-in-class function expertise is serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy following to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to establish and extend the superiority of our brands to make productivity is integral to our culture as innovation, to leave constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. As we said at CAGNY, the best response to the uncertainties and sources of volatility we face is to double down on this integrated set of strategies, which are delivering very strong results. These integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies are a foundation for strong balanced growth and value-creation. The best response to what we are challenged with today is to push forward, not to pull back, and that's exactly what we intend to do. I want to now describe how this approach has played out in the quarter we just completed and how we think it could play out across both, the longer term and the arguably more challenging short to mid-term. First, as I've said, strong results in the January to March quarter. When we spoke with you at the CAGNY conference on February 20th, we said that results for the January to March quarter in China and for the total Company will be materially impacted on both the top and bottom-line by the dynamics affecting the market in China. Remember at that point in time, COVID-19 was really just a China and travel retail issue. Korea had reported only 50 cases. The U.S., Japan, Italy and Iran combined had reported only 30 cases, 15 and 10, 3 and 2, respectively. At CAGNY, we were internally expecting organic sales in Greater China, our second largest and second most profitable market to be down as much as 20%. Through the incredible efforts of our organization, we did much better than we were expecting in Greater China, down only 8%, excluding travel retail. We saw a strong lift in our categories in e-commerce that make up a portion of sales lost in closed physical stores. We quickly restored production capability, built share as a result and are now operating at very close to full strength. As the pandemic unfortunately developed in the U.S. and Europe as the quarter progressed, demand surged. We finished the quarter with organic sales growth of 10% in the U.S., 14% in Canada, 6% in European focus markets, 15% in European enterprise markets and 11% in Latin America. At CAGNY, we were internally projecting Q3 organic sales growth for the Company of around 2%, we delivered 6% with 9 of 10 categories growing organic sales. We built aggregate share, despite temporary out-of-stocks in some of our highest demand items. While we don't have final U.S. all-outlet share through March, share results and track channels through March show broad-based growth. Vicks respiratory products were up more than 4 points, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol up 3 points. Olay moisturizers and Oral-B power toothbrushes up more than 2 points; Always Pads Always Discreet, Tampax, Tide, Dawn, Cascade and Gillette blades and razors each up 1 point or more; Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Native, Secret, Crest, Mr. Clean, Gain and Bounce, each growing share. As you can see in the track channel data, our share declined recently in baby and Family Care categories, due largely to out-of-stocks on our high demand brands. We're pushing production to its limits but we expect share softness to continue while consumer pantry stocking remains at extreme levels. In China, we built share in offline stores and in e-commerce. Safeguard and Gillette delivered strong share performance in both channels. Head & Shoulders is particularly strong offline in a way Whisper and Pampers posted solid online share growth. Top line results this quarter obviously benefited from consumer pantry loading in preparation for in-home quarantining. We're planning for pantry inventory levels to eventually return to normal. This higher level of consumer demand was served with our ramp-up and production levels and the depletion of retailer inventories. As at-home inventory decreases, we expect to refill the retail inventory pipeline. We believe the net effect of all of this shifted about 2 points of sales growth on a global basis from Q4 into Q3. Back to CAGNY, we were expecting a slight decline in core earnings per share for the quarter. We delivered instead a $1.17 per share, an increase of 10%. The significant volume of sales increase, related fixed cost leverage and our ongoing productivity efforts more than offset a growing FX challenge and higher virus-related operational costs. Commodities also provided a benefit. Core gross margin up 120 basis points, excluding currency up 130. Core operating margin up 100 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin up 180 basis points. Core earnings per share up 10%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%. $4.1 billion in operating cash flow, adjusted free cash flow productivity at 113%, returning $2.8 billion in cash to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchase. So, January-March, 6% organic sales growth, 10% core earnings per share growth, 113% free cash flow productivity building share. Fiscal year-to-date, 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth, over 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity building share. Just two days ago, we announced a 6% increase in our dividend, reflecting both, these results and the confidence we have in our future. This was the 64th consecutive annual increase and the 130th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, that's January through March and fiscal year-to-date, very strong results in very difficult conditions. Shifting to longer term, we remain well-positioned to serve consumers and create value in a very attractive industry. And as I said previously, our strategy to do this is unwavering. Consumption of our products is not likely to dissipate. In fact, the relevance of our categories and consumers' lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered health hygiene and cleaning focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be an increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home, more cleaning of homes with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There's potential for increased preference for established, reputable, dependable brands that solve newly framed problems better than other alternatives, potentially less experimentation. Potential for a lasting shift for e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. Increased demand has focused retailers on the core SKUs that drive the business. There's potential for this to result in a cutting of the long tail of inefficient SKUs and brands in our categories. We're discovering daily lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today's necessity birthing the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity rocket booster on the factory floor and in the office environment. So, in the longer term, we believe we are relatively well-positioned to serve consumers' heightened needs and their changing behavior to serve the needs of our retail and distributor partners across channels and geographies and to create value. In the short to midterm, outcomes are frankly anyone's guess. Epidemiologists will have wide variations in their best and worst case scenarios for viral spread, mortality, the shape and duration of the curve. We may see months of sporadic production suspension due to local quarantines or raw material supply. It's not just our operations that matter here. It's those of our suppliers, of contractors and of our transportation partners. A lot must go right in a very challenging environment and not all of it will. Customers may close stores. There will continue to be extreme foreign exchange and commodity costs volatility. Added operational complexity will result in higher costs. Unemployment will impact outcomes, perhaps severely. All of this occurs on top of what was already unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in our categories and markets. But, as you saw in the development of the business in just five weeks from CAGNY to March 31st and as we've just talked about in our long-term outlook where there's volatility, there are opportunities to serve as well as challenges. There's a very wide range of possible near-term scenarios and it's futile to spend too much time trying to assign probabilities to each. We'd be fooling ourselves and fooling you to try. As we stand here today though, we continue to believe our guidance ranges for the fiscal year on both the top and bottom lines remain relevant. Our internal forecasts remain within these ranges. But, I must again emphasize ranges and I must again emphasize the degree of uncertainty and volatility we face day to day. We currently expect organic sales growth for the year in the range of 4% to 5%, assuming continued operations in our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers. On the bottom line, we're forecasting core earnings per share growth in the range of 8% to 11% for the year. This tool assumes no significant interruption in the extended supply chain through to our retail and distributor partners. This earnings per share range now includes over $400 million of after tax foreign exchange headwinds. Just since CAGNY, FX has moved against us by approximately $0.10 per share, over 2 percentage points for core earnings per share growth on the year. And the fourth quarter FX is currently forecast to be a 7-point hit to core earnings per share growth. Please recall that our fourth quarter bottom line comps include the earnings gains from the Boston land sale and the divestiture of two Oral Care brands in the base period. These items combined are an additional 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth, Q4. While we do expect some midterm benefit in commodity costs from the recent decline in oil prices, it usually takes about six months for movements in feedstocks like oil to make their way through the raw material supply chain and our inventories to our P&L. That we don't expect to offset to FX headwinds from lower commodity costs within this fiscal year. As a result of all of this, you might likely guess that we're closer as we talk today to the bottom end of the earnings per share guidance range than the top end. But, we also go back quickly to our priorities and note that none of the three include hitting quarterly consensus estimates. We will be focused on serving colleagues, consumers, customers, communities, building our business for the many more months that will follow this crisis than the months that will exist within it. But we'll do this responsibly and keep our choices squarely centered on mid and long-term value-creation. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 100%. We'll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends, share repurchase in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. We'll provide our first outlook for fiscal 2021 on our year-end call as we typically do in July. Before turning to your questions, I want to address just two items I expect are on your minds. The first is liquidity. Our liquidity status remains very strong. We are a 183-year old company this year and we take a long-term view to balance sheet management. We aim to maintain our AA minus credit rating and to manage within the ratios that support that rating. With a $5 billion term issue three weeks ago at approximately 3%, we now have $15 billion in cash on hand and are generating more each day. We continue to have open access to the U.S. commercial paper markets, recently issuing over $3 billion on three months paper as a part of our routine financing efforts. The amount of debt maturing in the next 18 months is well within anticipated cash availability. And while we don't expect to need to draw on them, we have $8 billion in bank credit lines available if needed. That's credit, very strong. The second topic is recession. We're assuming it's already here and will be here for some period of time. While we are not immune, our current strategy puts us on better footing than prior downturns to weather economic headwinds. Our portfolio is now focused on daily use items where performance drives brand choice. We have much less exposure to discretionary items than we had during the last downturn. We've increased the superiority of our offerings, simultaneously increasing their value. While not perfect, we had stronger entries across price peers, better pricing ladders. We're emphasizing performance-based value messaging. We will serve with relevant pack sizes designed to hit key cash outlay thresholds for consumers who need to make week-to-week purchase decisions based on cash availability. Our productivity muscle is now well developed. None of these make us recession-proof, but they should each help. Summing up, the men and women at P&G working together to deliver three very strong quarters, averaging 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth and over a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, we've built market share. Our Board has increased the dividend 6%, reflecting both strong results and confidence in the future. We really do believe there is a very bright future ahead. We'll manage the short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve health, hygiene and cleaning needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest and society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. While we may not see you in person soon, we look forward to engaging with you on the phone and would love to hear your voice. We are here with you and are here for you. Feel free to call our offices as you normally would, our phones. You know where to find us. And with that, I'll be happy to take questions. Thanks, Steve. As it relates to the fourth quarter, there are, as you readily appreciate, a ton of moving parts. Geographies are in very different places in the cycle, categories have different levels of need and demand. There's the supply situation and then there is the retail inventory dynamics as well as consumer pantry dynamics. And again, you multiply that by a 100 countries around the world and 10 categories and many more brands and you realize that you probably don't have the answer. As we were sitting together at CAGNY five weeks ago, I don't think any of us in our conversations would have assumed how the next five weeks would unfold. And I don't pretend to know how the next 8 to 10 weeks is going to unfold. Having said that, you mentioned China. Our business there is rebounding nicely, both from an operations standpoint and from a consumption standpoint. We are seeing a continued significant demand in our categories and the supply and retail inventories are being steadily rebuilt. In the U.S., -- and I focus on these two markets because as you know, they are our largest markets, so to give you some relative feel. April has started off very strong double digit rates from an order standpoint. We expect that to tail off as the lines are set between retail inventory, restocking and consumer demand. But having said that, we are definitely seeing increased consumption levels, not just increased buying levels to put in pantries. I mentioned that in the U.S. we're seeing an increase in the number of loads of laundry that are done per week, the number of garments that are cleaned after one wearing. With much more in-home meal preparation, there's a lot more cleaning that needs to be done. And we're seeing consumption, for example at-home consumption of cleaning aids,, whether that's surface cleaners or paper towels or Swiffer continuing to be very, very strong. Our Home Care business, if I have my numbers right, was double digits in sales and that's following or in line with what we're seeing in terms of consumption. Now, having said all that, and sorry for the long answer but there's no short one. We have never faced the level of unemployment that we're likely to see in this country and potentially in others. And we don't know how long that will occur for. We've never faced a complete shutdown of very important channels of commerce, whether that's travel retail, whether that's the electric channel in Europe, whether that's the specialty beauty channel. So, there's a huge amount of volatility we're likely to experience and we'll learn more every day. Our fourth quarter sales guidance, deductively, given fiscal year-to-date results and our fiscal year guidance is minus 2 to plus 2. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 was about 2 points. So, that minus 2 to plus 2 on an apples-to-apples basis is really zero to 4. And while that may not seem like a lot, given a 6 year-to-date, recall again a number of things. One, it's our highest comp period. So, last year, organic sales by quarter were 4, 4, 5 and 7. 2 will have a full quarter of the impact of these channel closures and store closures. 3 will have the inventory dynamics, however, those net out that I described. So, when you put all that together, zero to 4, accurate, I doubt it, but it's representative of the combination of all those dynamics. So, it's the best number we have. And again, I apologize for the length of this answer, but it's not a topic that lends itself to simple formula. On recession and recessionary playbook, I really do believe that we have made major steps as a company since the last recession that significantly improve our hand, whether that's productivity, whether that's a focus on superiority, which is critical, because certainly price points matter and we're prepared to address that. But overall, value proposition really matters. And at a time when there's heightened concern about the need for a product to work and be efficacious, as I take care of my family and my home, the superiority plays an even bigger role.  So, the changes we've made there I think will put us in much better stead. I talked about the portfolio and the difference and the preponderance of our product serving needs on a daily basis versus much more discretionary portfolio and not daily use based in some categories that we've divested. So, this is a playbook that we've been developing for both good times and bad times, month-by-month, year-by-year. And I really do believe we're in a better position. Having said that, when something significant like this happens, would it be right to sit back and assume that we've got it covered? No. So, we are making very deliberate plans business by business, market by market to ensure we're as well positioned as we can be. And there will be changes and there will be adjustments, and they won't always be right, and we'll have to remain agile and learn and adjusted as we go. Thanks, Lauren. The promotional dynamics in our categories are changing pretty significantly, just as they are in food and beverage, which you referenced. It's really nobody's interest to be promoting products when you don't have them, when there is not a sufficient inventory to supply demand. So, if we look at for the full quarter, the amount of volume in our categories as a percentage of sales that moved on promotion, that's down about 5 points, and obviously that number would be much more significant in the month of March. And I don't really know how that will develop going forward, but certainly, if I had to guess, there will be less promotion in the next couple of quarters where the job is restocking and replenishing than had been the case historically. Price in the quarter was a net benefit of plus 1. And if I look back over the last 30 quarters, price has typically been a benefit of 1 to 2, sometimes, very rarely, but sometimes zero or minus 1, sometimes a little bit more, in that range. But it's pretty much in that range. And as I mentioned, our strategy is unchanging. So, an innovation based strategy, I don't see any reason why there will be a dramatic change in the contribution of price, particularly also because you have significant currency devaluations in many parts of the world, where some amount of pricing will be needed over time, done appropriately and sensitively to recover cost structures in those markets. Right now, in emerging markets outside of China, we're operating and thinking rightly or wrongly, day-by-day, because situation changes dramatically. India is a good example. That market is effectively shut and will be at least through the end of April. We're working with governments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to establish the essential nature of our product categories for their citizens and therefore gain the ability to operate, which we largely have. That's been a significant focus area over the last five weeks, and it's a daily endeavor. And then, once we establish our ability to operate, we then have to source materials and we have to ensure that employees can get to work, which sounds simple, but is anything but. For example, we'll go back to India again, there is a prohibition on any transport of people across state lines. And you can imagine, it wouldn't be unusual that we might have a plant or two that are located close to a state border, and you might imagine that some of the people that work in that facility live on the other side of that line. So, that's just an example of kind of the level of operational agility that we're having to execute. In order to continue operating in the Philippines, we had to basically secure access to a dorm next to our production facility in which to house and protect employees as a condition of operating. So, we're not that far out in our thinking about how to operate in these markets. Right now, it's day-to-day. Some real positive developments from a market share standpoint as I walked you through over the last quarter, and no reason for those underlying trends, not to continue, particularly when they're based on again, performance advantages at a time when performance is required more than ever. Will there be a trade down pressure? I don't know, but I think it would be silly to assume none. And will there be some share pressure as a result of pricing moves that need to be made? Undoubtedly that we're going to be very careful in terms of pricing that we do take in emerging markets and will likely tie that much more closely to local inflation than we would to the financial markets and currency and as a result should encounter fewer issues relative to competition than we would if we were just pricing to the currency conversion number. The biggest pressure on shares in the near term is none of any of that. It's the ability to supply very, very high levels of demand in some categories. I mentioned two categories in our prepared remarks, Family Care, which is our Bounty and Charmin business, and Baby Care. And let me just describe briefly some of the dynamics that occur in the Family Care category as an example. We can see a scenario where our business continues to grow at strong double digit rates and we lose share. That's because the market is growing at an even higher rate than that. Many of our competitors in that business source the industrial or commercial market, as well as the consumer market. Our business is entirely focused on the consumer market. Those companies have the ability with what is largely a shuttered hospitality industry as an example, to move production from an industrial or commercial focus to a consumer focus. You don't have that excess capacity to make that move. So, our throughput is up significantly on a per line basis. The results are going to be very, very good. But, we will probably, in that context, lose some share. So, what I wouldn't expect going forward, and I'm -- here I'm talking about the next three to six months is a continued steady increase in share levels. But, I also wouldn't expect significant diminution of our position. We're committed to not have that happen. We talk about that actively. But, there will be more volatility in the share numbers just because of all of the market dynamics that we're trying to manage. So, we obviously saw a positive margin development in the quarter we just completed. We've seen positive margin development fiscal year-to-date. Our guidance would imply positive margin development for the fiscal year. And as we talk about balance growth and value-creation, I've explained many times, but it's not possible to get to where we want to get from a value-creation standpoint without strong top line growth and margin improvement. Yes, there are some headwinds but there are also tailwinds, commodities as you mentioned, should be a tailwind longer term. And we've got our -- we continue our efforts on our productivity program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's additional learning that's come out of our experience the last five weeks on ways we might be even more productive, both in generating top line sales and in containing cost. So, my expectation there is that there continues to be a level of margin improvement going forward. In terms of product launch and we're in the middle now of going through each category and determining are there any changes that need to be made, either out of necessity or by design to maximize the impact of those planned initiatives. And in terms of how products are brought to market, I don't see really significant changes. For example, there's more media consumption that's occurring right now than probably there has been in the last three or four years. So, changing that model doesn't really make a lot of sense. And by media, I'm talking about not just TV but digital consumption as well. So, I don't see significant changes there. I think, our model with some adjustments will continue to be relevant and effective. And then, we just need to look at timing by initiative there. I wouldn't expect a net of that exercise either to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to grow. I don't have a category by category analysis of that. I just haven't had the time to get to that, although it's a very good question. But, what we do know and we refreshed learning on over the last five weeks is what's happened to market sizes in our categories during times of recession. And as you'll readily understand, our categories are not immune from recessionary impacts, but they're much less sensitive to that dynamic and most other categories across industry. And so, if we look at recessionary periods, the market has typically contracted in terms of its growth rate. So, it's continued to grow, but has contracted maybe 1 point. So, then the question becomes, okay, one, can we do anything about that if we can. Two, what's your relative position within that market and are you well-positioned to at least hold your ground if not build your position? And again, I feel better about that than I have at any time in our recent history. That doesn't mean that there won't be categories that from a market standpoint aren't impacted with more than others. And that doesn't mean that there won't be individual situations typically at a brand or category country level. In fact do lose some share. But, I mean, put it this way, as we think about our planning for next year, we're not giving ourselves any break relative to share. We expect to hold and build share. Absolutely, we should expect growth in these markets, absent physical barriers, either regulations or operational barriers that prevent products from getting first into stores and into markets and into consumers' hands. It's not necessarily a harbinger of the future, but I mentioned Latin America as an example growing 11% in the last quarter. The fundamental drivers of that demand remain as we go forward. In terms of our ability to capture those opportunities, our strategy in emerging markets is fundamentally the same and it's been working very, very well from both the top line standpoint and a bottom-line standpoint. By the same, I mean, our focus on superior products in daily use categories where performance means brand choice, delivered as productively as we can, and we still have lots of opportunities to improve in that context. With excellent communication, best-in-class go-to-market execution, the playbook is the same and works in enterprise markets. Let me start in a slightly different place, but I will get to your end points. The Beauty business generally and which is a primary business that's sold in travel retail, continues to perform very strongly. We hit our 17th quarter of organic -- consecutive of organic sales growth in Beauty in what is arguably the most difficult quarter we faced in a long, long time, really significant and positive growth across almost all parts of the portfolio. So, we overcame in the quarter a greater than 20% reduction in SK-II sales with solid growth in our other categories. The travel retail business specifically is round number, is a $1 billion business that's gone. It's gone because there's no travel. Having said that that -- the products that were brought in travel retail were consumed in markets and our job needs to be to make up for that travel retail loss in the near term by serving those markets. And we are for example, seeing significant uptake already on SK-II consumption purchase in mainland China, which was one of the big sources of the travel retail demand. So, generally, are performing very, very well in Beauty. And we'll continue to -- the SK-II impact will have a full quarter now going forward for the next three quarters in all likelihood. So, the challenge will become greater in terms of overcoming that. But, we're in a pretty good position to be able to at least make progress in that direction. From a Grooming standpoint, we don't share during the quarter on global basis, which is great, and follows on a number of periods in a row now of share growth for the global Grooming business. The biggest challenge we face on -- we face two challenges in Grooming currently. One is, which I just -- actually I don't even know I talked about it here, doesn't matter, is the closing of the electric channel in Europe where a large amount of Braun products were sold. That also affects, by the way our power Oral Care business, which also utilizes our channel. But presumably, as soon as that reopens, which hopefully will be soon, that challenge dissipates. The other challenge is lower shave frequency while working from home, to put it bluntly. But, that's something where we're currently working through. As I said, we've built share, we want to maintain our share position. We need to work with our retail partners as well who have in some cases, de-prioritized grooming in the very near term to deal with the empty shelves and some of the other aisles of the store. If we can do that effectively, no reason we can't continue to hold and build share. We need to stay very close to consumers and their habits, needs and desires more now than ever. Just because we're at change points in their habits and their consumption levels, and we need to understand those and be responsive to those. We actually meet as a portion of the leadership group three mornings a week at 7 o'clock. And one of the things that we're very focused on in that meeting is, what is changing relative to consumer need and making sure, I mentioned SKU portfolio is one example, but making sure that we're positioning ourselves to serve those changing needs as well as we possibly can. I think, the net in terms of demand impact on our total portfolio is clearly a positive longer term. And I don't -- and when I say that I almost -- I don't want to minimize for a second any amount of human suffering that's led to the situation. But, we are seeing increased levels of consumption in the majority of our product categories. Even when we come to something like Beauty, remember, I talked about how this is a 17th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth in a row. And to get to organic sales growth on Beauty with a minus 20%-plus number on SK-II, you have to assume very healthy purchase and consumption levels across the portfolio, which we're seeing. And I don't see a reason that that wanes. So, generally, thank you for pointing again to the long-term, which we view as -- we want to -- it's trite and overused statement, but we really do expect to come out of this stronger than we went into it. We really do believe that there's a very bright future ahead. And to your point, we need to be very deliberately keeping ourselves aware of what those opportunities are and putting steps in place to be able to seize those opportunities again really under the heading of fully serving consumers. Generally -- so, let me take you through recent trends and then I realize your question was more future-focused. We're seeing modest increases in private label share in North America, at the same time that we're building significant share ourselves. We're seeing private label share declines pretty consistently in Europe at a time when we're building share there as well. We can grow our business and our share and Europe is a prime example, we've done it for years, during the time when private label is growing. So, that's the first and very, very important point. Second, in terms of recessionary dynamics, as it relates to private label, I don't -- we see a number of different behaviors, which affect that overall equation. There are certainly a subset of consumers for whom price becomes a significantly greater portion of their personal value equation. And that will in some cases result in a trade down to private label. Our job becomes having an offering alternatives for them that allows them to achieve the same objective within our branded portfolio. And we have many more rungs in that pricing ladder now than we had during the last recession. There are other consumers who move the other way for whom performance, efficacy, dependability, I can't afford to be wrong, I can't buy two, so I need to buy the best, results in a migration to branded offerings. And that's different by category and by market. But again, going back to something we've mentioned a couple of times in this call, I don't see any reason for us to have an expectation of ourselves that we hold their build share over reasonable periods of time, I mean given month or given quarter, or given category or given country will have issues. But our expectation is that, whether this is a V-shaped recovery, whether it's L-shaped recovery, whether it's a prolonged recession, with our portfolio as it's structured today, continued to focus on superiority, continued focus on excellence and execution, we should be able to hold and build share positions. So, in some categories, Bill, we have -- we do have the ability to tease out increases in consumption from pantry loading, et cetera. And for example, there are several categories in the U.S. where we have a panel of either consumers or devices, washing machines, dishwashers that give us information on a routine basis on consumption levels. And where we have that in place, that's how we're able to know, for example, when I mentioned earlier, what's happening to wash frequency of clothes and what constitutes that load, the same in a dishwashing context. So, we're able to in those categories, see very clearly the increase in use and consumption and obviously then deduct into what might be pantry stocking. There are other categories where we don't have as good a visibility into that, but we're working to develop that ability across each of the categories in the major markets, and that's the clear focus. But, I would say that in general, we're seeing as much as a 20% increase in consumption across categories of where you'd expect to see that and the balance is pantry to some extent. But remember also, in many of our categories, pantry availability itself leads to greater usage. I start conserving on my usage for example of paper towel or certainly of bathroom tissue as I reach the end of my inventory to defer that trip to the store and certainly avoid a situation where I don't have any available. If there is lots available, I'm typically not rationing or conserving. So, just having it there results in increased consumption in many of our categories. I'm not the expert in the company on advertising, but I would offer a couple of thoughts. Helping consumers understand how they can meet their own perceived and critical needs for them and their family through the use of our products and many categories is a public service. And as well for many years, well before this, we focused on, if you will, both. Think about the Always Like a Girl campaign as an example. And done well, you can do both simultaneously. But, again, I'm not the advertising expert. If you want more perspective on that, feel free to call my friend Marc Pritchard. Let me start with the second question. We have a very simple philosophy and belief, which is that the cash we generate is not ours, it's yours. And we have -- that's of course after meeting the needs of -- and opportunities that are presented by attractive investments. We're having a good year. And if we deliver against our guidance, it'll be 8% to 11% core earnings per share growth, operating earnings growth has been pretty much in line with that. And going back to the philosophy and the commitments, that results in a certain outcome. Our business is generally highly cash generative. So, I mentioned we generated $4.1 billion of cash in the quarter. Our payout ratio, with the move we've just made is a little bit under 60%. So, there's plenty of room there, if you will. So, it really stems from our philosophy and our commitment and our result and the cash generative nature of our business. And I don't expect that to change going forward. Obviously, in extreme situations, we might come to a different conclusion. But so far we've been weathering this situation fairly well and expect to do well as we go forward. I might also just comment on the general topic of capital allocation. I started receiving some questions on share repurchase and whether that's appropriate use of funds in this environment. And I don't fully understand the question. I do, if you're accepting government support or something like that. But again, going back to our philosophy, that's your cash, not our cash that needs to come back to you, either through a dividend or share repurchase. And probably, the worst thing we could do at this period of time when I go back to our priorities, the third one being to help society get through this crisis is take a bunch of cash and sit on it. We're much better off, I think, returning that cash to society and helping people, during a very difficult time. And as you know, we have a large percentage of retail share owners, individual people, and we have a large ownership position from pension funds, which are representing the needs and wants and dreams or desires of frontline healthcare workers, firemen, policemen, of the bus driver, of teachers. And so, I don't see any reason not to maintain the stance we've taken for many, many years relative to cash return. And I think it's more vital now than ever. Sorry. I got kind of waylaid on that point, but it's what I feel strongly about. Relative to e-commerce, it differs pretty widely by category, by country. But, generally, our market shares in e-commerce, our online shares are equal to our offline share or slightly ahead. And also, our margins are generally in line, online and offline. In general, the things that we do to win and best serve consumers offline are relevant online as well. But, there are some specific things we can do to better serve both online shoppers and online retailers, for example, with packaging that's designed to survive the e-commerce journey, which was physically very demanding, and we're working to develop proprietary packaging that improves packaging integrity and consumer experience in that specific channel. So, there are channel specific areas of superiority that we can help our customers be relevant and in the process increase our relevance. Thanks everybody. Stay well, stay safe. We're here. Don't hesitate to call. Have a great day."

            "name": "A - Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Sure, Wendy. Let me start with the second part of your question. The e-commerce business grew about -- globally about 35% in the quarter. It's now about 10% of our business globally. As we've talked many times previously, we view ourselves as very well positioned within that channel and continue to strengthen that position. The two largest sources of growth by far are the U.S. and China with some categories growing in e-commerce in those two markets, as much as 50%. And obviously the at-home dynamics and the unwillingness to congregate in physical stores is driving a fair amount of that. We'll have to see where that nets out, but I don't think it all goes away. I think, we've seen a permanent shift in the percentage of business that's going to be done in e-commerce and we view that positively. And when I talk about e-commerce, I'm talking broadly including omni-channel, click and pick, and all forms and varieties of e-commerce. Microban is a wonderful, fantastic product. We were serendipitous in terms of our launch timing. We are at full capacity at this point and are focused on the products we currently have in markets and the channels that we're currently operating in. But obviously, we'll work to develop that business to its full potential and that could include a number of different avenues of pursuit. So, definitely relative to the quarter that we just completed, China offers upside quarter-to-quarter sequentially, and I expect that upside is significant. I would see us growing that business ideally at very healthy levels, at pre-crisis levels ideally in the subsequent quarter, which you're right, would get -- give a lift to the zero to 4 kind of logic. We are seeing, at least in China, mix come back in pre-crisis levels from a positive standpoint. I mentioned the strength of the SK-II restart as an example. So, that also is a positive. But remember, we have massive challenge ahead of us collectively in the U.S. and Europe, depending on how the economy develops. I mean, we literally sense the Great Depression had not managed with the level of unemployment we might see. So, the question behind your question is, is there upside to the zero to 4, I would encourage you not to go there. Operator: Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. As this was another relatively straightforward quarter, and as David Taylor will be with us to provide additional depth at CAGNY in just a few weeks. I'm going to keep prepared remarks this morning brief, turning fairly quickly to your questions. This was another very solid quarter, top line, bottom line and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization strategies. Organic sales up 5%, three points of volume growth, two points of price mix. Two-year stack average growth of 4.5%, fiscal year-to-date organic sales growth of 6%, calendar year 2019 organic growth of 6%. This growth continues to be broad based. Nine of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal Care up double digits, Personal Health Care and Home Care grew high singles, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Grooming grew mid-single digits. Family Care grew low singles. Focus markets and enterprise markets each grew mid singles. We continue to perform very well in our two largest markets, the US up 4% and China up 13% for the quarter, aggregate market share continuing to grow. These results required us to overcome several challenges. While we're seeing real signs of progress with Grooming organic sales up 4% this quarter, we're still working to sustainably improve results in this business and in Baby Care. Sales results in Japan, our third largest market, created nearly a half point drag on total company organic sales growth due to the timing of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1. The timing as we highlighted last quarter, led to higher shipments last quarter and lower shipments in the quarter we just completed. We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets, India, the UK, Australia, Turkey, Iraq, Nigeria, Kenya, Lebanon, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Hong Kong market. Through all of this, we grew organic sales 5% on the quarter and 6% over the first half. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were up 14% versus the prior year. Foreign Exchange was a one point earnings growth headwind, so on a constant currency basis core earnings per share increased 15%. Fiscal year-to-date core earnings per share are up 18%, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin up 200 basis points in the second quarter, core operating margin up 190 basis points, continued strong cash generation, with operating cash flow of $4.4 billion and free cash flow productivity of 100%. $1.9 billion of dividends paid, $3.5 billion of P&G stock repurchased, $5.4 billion of cash returned to shareholders. We'd another strong quarter, solid volume sales and market share trends across both categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareholders. We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and of competitive response to our growth. But all in we're continuing to make progress behind a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. The strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We establish and extend the superiority of our brands. To make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability, reinforce and build on each other. They position as well within our industry to deal with near term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term. Moving to guidance, we're again increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth, for core earnings per share growth and for free cash flow productivity, as well as cash return. We started the year with organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 4%. We increased the range to 3% to 5% last quarter and are now increasing the range to 4% to 5%. This 4% to 5% range compares with underlying market growth of 3% to 4%, implying continued market share growth. On the bottom line our core earnings per share growth guidance started the year at a range of 4% to 9%. We raised the range to 5% to 10% last quarter and we're now increasing the range again to 8% to 11% for the year. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to 95% last quarter and now to 100%. We'll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash returned expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and now increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. While we've delivered strong first half results, please keep in mind that comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both top line and bottom line. Pricing annualizes as we move through the back half of the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the Boston landfill and Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors are responding to our outperformance, which will require continued innovation and equity building investments on our part. And the market level challenges I mentioned earlier will be top and bottom line headwinds for the balance of the year. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not included within the new and improved guidance ranges. We look forward to seeing many of you at the CAGNY conference in just a few weeks. As I mentioned, David Taylor will join us and we'll provide further perspective on forward looking strategies and plans. We look forward to engaging with you into benefiting from your thoughts and reactions. With that I'm happy to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey Jon, I want to just focus on organic sales growth obviously the 5% results still very healthy this quarter, but it is below 7% in each of the prior two quarters. It sounds like some of that's Japan timing based on the prepared remarks. I'm assuming perhaps the US inventory reductions as the retailer's approach fiscal year end. So just want to get your read on an underlying basis looking at retail sales growth and shipment timing ex inventory changes, has anything changed in terms of the underlying momentum as you look at the fiscal Q2 results versus the last couple of quarters. And then within that answer, perhaps you can just touch briefly on the competitive environment. Have you seen incremental promotion with the recent commodity pullback, and also give us an update on China performance in the quarter and any impact so far from the virus that we're seeing over there? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: I could complete the whole call there. On the first part of your question, we're very pleased with the top line growth in the quarter that we just completed. As you all know, we delivered 7% as you mentioned in the prior quarter, our guidance was three to five for the full fiscal year, implying something below that beyond the first quarter, and we delivered at the high end of that range. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth was broad based both across categories and regions. And we built market share. From an underlying consumption standpoint, you've seen the uptick numbers, at least through December, which continue to be very strong. And we really haven't seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook kind of first part of the current quarter. So all the fundamentals are there, our superiority levels continue to increase, we're investing behind that while building margins. We're building market share and increasingly the growth is broader as you look at both categories and geographies. We did have some headwinds in the quarter from two items. You mentioned probably three. You mentioned one which is Japan and that had a half point impact which benefited the prior quarter. The other dynamic has been a series and I mentioned this also in my prepared remarks of geopolitical, economic, societal and other impacts in individual markets. I mean, think about what's happened in the last \u2013 well, since we last gathered even. The situation in the Hong Kong market has continued to be difficult, which had a real impact on the quarter and had an impact on the travel retail business. Some of the market level events in South America whether that's Argentina or Chile, where stores were burnt and are not yet back in place. Some of the events that you're very familiar with in our headline items in the Middle East impacted our business as well. And those items will impact us going forward for the balance of the year. I'm very \u2013 we're very pleased that we were able to overcome all of that, and still deliver very strong numbers that built share and build household penetration and allow us to deliver significant bottom line benefits. From a competitive environment standpoint which was the second part of your question. Promotion levels \u2013 percentage of sales in our category sold and promotion are actually down. The index at 98 for the last quarter, that's all I have visibility to. I don't have visibility to the future. And where individual competitors are up versus year ago, they're up typically a point. So very simply and we can get into this later with others if you want more detail. We're not seeing competitive activity that's indicative of downward price spirals by any means. That can change tomorrow, but what we have in front of us today continues to look very healthy. China, we are very optimistic about our prospects in China. It's a difficult market. It moves at a very fast pace both of our consumer and trade channel standpoint. But we continue to increase the rate of growth in that market. You'll recall four years ago, we were at minus one. The following year, we were at plus seven, fusing plus \u2013 minus five, plus one, plus seven, last year plus 10 and fiscal year-to-date of plus 13. So that continues to be a very attractive market within that some really strong growth rates in some categories. I'm talking the high 20% in categories like Skin Care, Feminine Care over 20%, Fabric Care double digits, so generally a very strong market. I have no idea what the developments are going to be relative to the new virus. We're obviously monitoring that closely as it relates both to the health of our employees and broader communities. And we'll have to see what impact that has, if any, on whether this was going forward. But it's one of those things that I do think it's important to mention because it can have broad impacts well beyond China. It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market. It can affect travel, which does affect our business. And so it's one of the many pieces of volatility that's just important we keep front of us as we think about the prospects for the future which I view is generally extremely positive, but not without risking without challenge.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.\nSteve Strycula: Hi, good morning. So Jon, I'll stick to one topic here. And just to clarify one of your responses. The slowdown you're seeing in travel retail is that specific to Hong Kong or is it a little bit broader based in China. That would be a quick clarification. And the broader question would be can you talk to just what we're seeing across the global beauty spectrum in the portfolio right now, how is China performing with SK-II versus Olay and then what is the opportunity to extend SK-II to broader markets looking forward? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Another three parter, I'll try to get to each of the pieces efficiently. Travel retail concentrated in Hong Kong. Beauty broadly continues to do extremely well. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth with Q2 up 8%. That growth is broad based. Healthcare grew 6% of the quarter. Our Skin and Personal business grew to 10%. It was actually a relatively slow quarter for SK-II given both the VAT dynamic in Japan where SK-II has a big business and the Hong Kong dynamics. Skin Care broadly in China, as I mentioned, is doing extraordinarily well. Olay was up strong, strong double digits. And \u2013 but the balance of the business as well. Our Safeguard business, which is part of our beauty, grew double digits, again strong double digits over 20%. So the growth in beauty both on a global basis and within the China market is broad based. I think you asked another question, but I'd don't \u2013 SK-II expansion. Yeah. There are \u2013 so first of all, there are significant opportunities in the markets that we're in as evidenced by the current growth rates. There are also the right time and in the right way, expansion opportunities available. Are there other questions?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just want to double click on what you just said on the China \u2013 from the China, how it evolved for the quarter and if you're baking any more level of conservatism into the backend of the year given what happened recently. So I think what you also discuss is Hair Care coming back, so you've got a gating effect from what could be expected in a continuation and all the deceleration for SK-II. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Let me first talk about Hair Care and I'm assuming the questions is in the China context. We grew Hair Care in the mid to high single digits in China, which is the fastest growth rate in a period of time. And so yes, that can offer some offsets if you will to other businesses that may soften to competitive activity or other things. On the other hand, the Hair Care business is a highly, highly competitive business as are many other categories. So the dynamics can change there quite rapidly. Our job is to continue to steadily increase our margin of superiority. And if we do that, over time, if not quarter-to-quarter, we'll continue to have a strong business. In terms of the conservatism in the back half of the year, I'll answer this question both relative to China which obviously we don't provide specific guidance for and the balance of the company. One thing to keep in mind with China is the timing of Chinese New Year, which is, you know, from all the press on China recently is happening beginning as we speak. And that is earlier in the calendar year than it typically occurs. And so it's likely there was some sell in the OMD period that wouldn't have been there and the prior period. But on a global P&G basis that doesn't move the needle significantly, but something just to be aware of as relates to the China specific situation. I talked in my prepared remarks about some of the headwinds that exist that increase there in the quarter and will impact us in the back half of the year or could impact us in the back half of the year. We talked about the market level dynamics. So if you take a market that may not be that large, but take a market like Chile. That impact happened at the very end of the quarter, and will exist through the balance of the year. The same with, for example, the situation in Lebanon, the same for the situation in Iraq, the Indian market, the growth rates have slowed, still growing and we're doing very well and building chair. But the challenges there have increased and will likely remain for the balance of the year. So that's one reason, one thing that needs to be netted against to strong progress that we hope to continue to make. The other is the annualization of price increases. So for example, in February, we annualize both a Dish Care price increase from year ago and a Family Care price increase from a year ago. And I don't want to talk about how we're going to handle pricing going forward. That's kind of off limits. But regardless though the annualization impacts as well as some of the price increases we've taken for evaluation over the last year will annualize. And third is the competitive environment. And I don't know what that's going to hold. I've described what it's held so far. But most of our calendars \u2013 most of our competitors are calendar year based. They start their new fiscal years as we speak. And many of them have talked, understandably, about increasing investments for growth. That can be a very healthy thing. It can grow categories, we can all benefit from that. But certain implementations of that obviously are less healthy. Now, against all of that backdrop, we continue to make progress on the things that we control or making very strong progress, our margin of superiority is increasing across the board. It's dynamic, it's not static. So we have moves forward and moves back, but the net move is a forward move. We're in a position because of our productivity programs to invest to support communication of that superiority. And that's really driving some outsized growth in many of our categories. And over time and it will take some time. I expect we'll deliver higher growth rates on businesses like Baby Care. So overall, we're very optimistic about where we stand today and what the future holds, at least in the near term, but it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the challenges that exist.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I'm going to ask one question. And I just wanted to talk a little bit about Grooming and particularly shaving. And you'd mentioned there were still some devaluation driven pricing. And I just was curious if you could talk about performance to the business to specific to developed markets, and how things are trending the impact of Gillette sensitive, you've made some portfolio moves, right. There's been several already been apart, you've just acquired Billie. So you can maybe give us a little bit of lay of the land there how you're chipping away and making progress or not so much in shave care would be great.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Lauren. And within that one question you've managed to ask three which is very well done. Our Grooming business strengthened in the quarter overall, we were up 4% and that's the third consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, we grew global market share point three points, which is very encouraging. Shaving within that was up versus year ago, not as much as \u2013 I mean not as much as the dry shave business, but the wet shave business did grow. And we've seen pretty strong response to our investments both in products in and communication. Encouragingly, we've added 18 million new users to our brands over the last 12 months. SkinGuard is contributing to category growth; it's doing well and continues to expand. In the US, for example, razor value share on SkinGuard is now 9%, which is a third largest for a P&G sub brand. And we're building unlike most of our competitors our shave business online. We're pretty excited about the Billie acquisition. That's something that obviously needs to pass regulatory clearance. And we need to remain separate from that business until that happens. But there's a real unique set of skills, experiences and knowledge between Billie and P&G that we think has the potential to create some real magic. Clearly, they've created very effectively a fresh new brand that extends across several categories. And they've done it and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one-to-one mass marketing, which is something we're continuing to increase our focus on and capabilities related to. We have innovation capability across the majority of their categories. We have best in class manufacturing across the majority of their categories. And we have a go-to-market presence, both online and brick-and-mortar, certainly in omni channel that can accelerate the growth in that business. So we're very excited about the potential and are working through the clearance process.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: Hey, I think \u2013 I wanted to ask in more detail your view about the future on pricing for kind of the future solidness of some of recent price increases globally given there is starting to be just like Jon competitive murmurs of more investments coming. You know, like most recently Exedy [ph] in Europe, yesterday's really talking about pricing, and commodities clearly continue to fall. Again, you're not seeing anything yet. But within that context, two questions. One is what kind of lead time notice you get in terms of price competition? So can you feel comfortable saying it's all clear for a quarter or it's clear for two quarters, or just like literally this may change tomorrow? And then the second thing is part of our cost of jobs is pattern recognition. And so historically, we have seen that prices, this increased rate's been on everything down in categories, especially maybe in Family, with these types of commodity decline. Do you think this time is different and if so kind of why? So there's a technical question on timing, and there's more of a, how do you see the go for given the patterns we've seen it for. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Ali. Obviously, just related to Exedy first, they're talking about a market that we're not competing in. I know that you know that. That is a very different market. It's much more of a commodity market than our primary market from a talent standpoint, which is what I believe they were talking about, which is North America. In general, we see commodity prices as supportive of the current prices in the market. So while they're down some versus kind of historical levels and where we were before the price increases went into effect, we feel the current prices are justified that does not speak to an indication of future activity, I won't go there. And our outlook for those commodities continues to be relatively flat to slight increases, particularly in the in the pulse space. But I don't see the kind of sea change environment that would necessitate activity. Having said that each competitor will do what they choose to do and we need to be responsive to that which gets to your second question. And candidly, we do not have advance notice of the implementation of price increases. And so we are \u2013 decreases sorry, either one. And so we react as we see those in the marketplace. And that reaction time, typically is anywhere from a quarter to six months. So if we think along a reasonable period of time. I don't expect this to be a crippling dynamic or anything resembling that going forward and may cause a quarter of two of odd benefit or hurt, but not a big thing to worry about.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Unlike some of your peers who have had less margin expansion and your margin trends have been terrific. And a lot of that seems to been driven by the productivity initiatives. I know you're kind of coming. Are you in your felt for maybe of your five year program? And I'm just wondering, what's your outlook, not for the next quarter, but sort of for the next two to three years? Is there another $10 billion restructuring program coming or how do you keep this productivity benefits accruing when you come into the end of the program. Thanks\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Wendy. I mentioned as one of our strategic choices, the desire to make productivity as integral to our nature, as innovation, and be leaders in productivity just as we are in innovation. And I think we've made a lot of progress on that journey, as you rightly point out, which is reflected in our margins certainly this quarter. My hope is that as we move forward, this is simply an integral part of our operating strategy. And it needs to be because we will need to continue to invest in \u2013 of holding advancing our margin of superiority. Some of the continuous disruption we're talking about will also require some investment that's in human resources, capital, et cetera. And I feel very good about each of the business units understanding and commitment to continue delivering productivity. So that brings us to another part of the question which is, are there degrees of freedom that enable that to occur? Will is one thing, delivery is another. And I don't think we've ever been in a place where there are more degrees of freedom or more opportunities to improve productivity, the tools that we have available to us now across the digital spectrum and that's everywhere from marketing to the manufacturing floor to the office environment, had never offered more opportunity than they do today. And we have significant opportunities still in terms of how we think about our new organization structure and other opportunities within that as we learn more about it to become even more efficient and effective and I certainly believe they are \u2013 there are. I just attended along with David, a review of our product supply innovation program last week, and there are big opportunities relative to robotics, relative to a tighter sequencing of the entire supply chain from order signal all the way back to delivery where the middle of a sustainable product supply transformation across markets and geographies. So I continue to believe that productivity will be an inherent part of our operating strategy and we have the tools and opportunities to continue to deliver that.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about advertising because that continues to move up 150 basis points this quarter. And at this point, I think there's a fair bit of investment already in the base. So was that always applying to continue to increase? Or is this more optimistic than you expected? Was it \u2013 is there anything that you need to defend? Because obviously, you said that we haven't seen that much of a change in percent of sales goals on promos. So just wondering where that advertising dollar is going towards? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: A couple of things there Olivia, we've been very clear. I think that while we need to be competitive in the trade spending standpoint and need to offer attractive margins to our retail partners, where we have a degree of flexibility, we would prefer to spend that incremental dollar on advertising or innovation every day of the week. The reason is very simple. There's nothing proprietary and pricing, we can build proprietary advantage with both advertising and innovation. So again, on the margin, where we have the opportunity to make those shifts, we're doing it. And we're doing it in a way that is attractive to our retail partners as well because it drives business and grows categories. The second piece we've talked a lot about, and Marc Pritchard, our Chief Marketing Officer has talked a lot about externally is the opportunity to move what were historically a significant amount of non-working dollars into working and advertising. And that's been about a billion dollar shift and it continues. And the third piece of this is when you have innovation that's noticeably superior. You need to want to ensure would be communicating that superiority and those performance benefits and the value that comes with them to consumers. And the good news is we have a lot of very strong innovation in the marketplace that has a lot of legs left in terms of either just launched or something like paws or beads which have been on the market for a number of years that have significant household penetration opportunities and our pure delighters from a consumption standpoint. We want to be supporting those. I mentioned both as relates to competitive activity, but also in general that we will continue to invest in both equity and innovation as we move forward.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Good morning Jon. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Can we come back to China which was particularly strong in the quarter against a notably difficult comparison? Can you delineate a bit the company's progress in that market between category strength and superior Proctor market share performance and maybe how that's changed? You talk about Skin Care, obviously very strong up 20%. Fem Care, I think was up double digits. Maybe just talk a little bit about how much of this is category versus strategic execution by Proctor in certain categories and then your expectations here for the balance of the year? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Kevin. It's honestly hard to separate those because if we do our job right from an execution standpoint and an innovation standpoint of a growth, we grow markets, so we don't view market growth as something that is separate from our efforts. It's in many cases, obviously not 100%. But it's caused by our efforts. I realized that's not that helpful to you, but it's an important point. As we back up from that and I look at category growth in China, it continues to be strong in our categories. The one area that's under a little bit of pressure from a category growth stand point is Baby Care and that relates to the birth rates, which have gone from about 15 million babies a year down to 10, which is significant impact. On the other hand, within that category, there are significant premiumization opportunities and the premium part of our business is growing 20% or 30%, depending on whether that's premium tape diapers or pants style diapers, but in general and China the answer on category growth is remains very strong. The answer on if you will P&Gs specific efforts if you pretend for a second that they're not impacting category growth that also is abundant and real. I mean, we've gone \u2013 it's not that the inflection in category growth rate that has changed the results on Skin Care, it's our share of progress within the category, albeit in a very growth full category. So we've gone from declines, perennial declines on that business to perennial gains and strong double digit gains. The improvement in our Hair Care top line is still not what we'd like it to be but definitely improved from where we've been. Is a result of much stronger branding and innovation efforts as well as go-to-market strengthening, so it's hard for me to fuse those apart? The simple answer is it's both and that's a good thing.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the mind of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks and Happy New Year. Two questions for me. First on US growth, you mentioned 4%. Obviously, solid in context of the US, but it is a decel from last quarter and it comes despite an easier comp. Is there anything worth calling out any nuance to take note of there on that growth? And then secondly, on the Baby, Fem and Family Care segment, growth was a little weaker than we expected this quarter. It's kind of bleak as we've seen in a while. I know this has been one business, it's been a little harder for you to kind of get going like everything else. Can you walk us through what the game plan is and what our expectations should be for that business as we think about the next 12 months? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: I'll start where you started. US growth of 4% is indeed very strong and it's building market share. We built market share in the US over the past three, six and 12 months periods. Nine of our 10 categories grew in the US in the last quarter. The one that didn't was either at a 98.5 or 99.5 index. The difference between the quarters reflects a number of things. Part of it is trade inventory, which was reduced as we went through the second quarter. There's initiative timing that impacts this pretty significantly as well. I would expect going forward we're going to continue to see some chop, if we look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But across a slightly longer period of time, we remain very, very happy with the way the business is progressing. And if we look at underlying consumption going back to a discussion earlier in this call that continues to be as you've seen, at least the scanner data, very, very strong. From a Baby Care standpoint, if you look at the first half of the year, Baby Care was flat to up slightly which is a better position we've been in. And it ranges from \u2013 if we look at our two largest markets, China and the US, those are relatively \u2013 again on a relative basis healthy. China in the first half, we grew at 5%. That's the fastest growth where we've had from \u2013 on a semester basis in about six years. We regain market share leadership about two years ago and have continued to hold that. As I mentioned, in the last answer, we're growing our premium business our pants business, very, very strongly. The US we're about flat versus year ago, which again, is an improvement on a relative basis. And what should take both of those businesses as well as the broader Baby Care business to a stronger position is innovation which builds superiority. We have across parts of the portfolio, not been offering a superior product. It's larger than some of those cases of parody product. We have strong innovation plans in place not only in terms of eco mentality, but we really increase the pace of innovation and the amount that's coming to market, a lot of which has driven the China results that I talked about. But innovation, whether it's a Baby Care or Beauty Care, it's not an overnight endeavor and we'll continue to hopefully, improve sequentially as we go forward.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess maybe just a quick question for you, Jon. The enterprise versus rest of business seems to slow down a little bit. You guys don't really talk about EM versus DM kind of anymore, but maybe talk a bit about what has driven the slowdown you touched on Chile, Hong Kong, et cetera. How much is that in terms of country specific issues versus laughing the pricing and kind of happy to be thinking about that dynamic on a go forward basis?\nJon Moeller: We're pretty pleased with the growth rates in the enterprise markets currently. We mentioned mid-single digits. It's really at the border of mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll leave you with that. And that's despite these pretty significant impacts. If you think about two of the largest markets in the enterprise environment are India and Mexico, and I talked about the slowing growth rates in India, largely as a result of some of the monetary policies, which has created a bit of a liquidity squeeze, which is drying up inventory through the system. But we continue to grow well in India and are building share. Mexico's technically, from an economic growth standpoint, in a recession. We continue to grow reasonably well there. We have been single digits and are growing share there as well. So broadly, we continue to be pretty pleased with our progress. And just briefly, even though it wasn't part of your question on the bottom line, we're creating more value in these markets currently then we ever have. So our bottom line progress was strong double digits, well ahead of the company average. We need to be focused on value creation in these markets that includes growth where we can generate a meaningful return and that's what we're focused on doing and there's tons of opportunity.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you, Jon. I'd like to kind of focus on ecommerce. I think in the past, you've said that it's about 8% of sales is that moved up maybe closer to 10? And globally, how fast is it growing on a global basis, then specifically how fast in China, how fast in the US and are you gaining share in ecommerce in China and the US? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: It continues to be a significant opportunity for growth. It's currently growing at about 30%. And in the big ecommerce markets, well, that growth differs across categories. It's pretty much at that level across markets. It is now about 10% of our total business. And what I \u2013 just for clarity when I mention ecommerce, I'm talking obviously the totality of ecommerce which includes omni channel. And our market share in general has been increasing. Of course, there's some volatility to that, but particularly in a china context and again it differs by category. We've been making significant progress in that space, so I see us as very well positioned to succeed in that space, though that's something that requires eternal efforts, flexibility and the constructive disruption of ourselves which we're committed to, to ensure that we offer a competitive and relevant offering, wherever consumers want to shop, whether that's ecommerce, whether that's large format or that's small format. And generally, we're progressing well in each of those.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Yes. Good morning. Thanks, everyone. Jon, maybe you can talk a little bit about the Merck OTT business. I mean, health care of was a pretty nice contributor to the top line. So just wanted to understand what's driving that business, kind of what's the strategy there? Any context would be helpful. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: As you probably recall, Merck offers a very complimentary portfolio to our legacy Personal Healthcare P&G business. Has a strong presence in the developing world, complimentary categories across geographies and there were significant we felt cost synergies in addition to revenue synergies by bringing the best of both companies together and driving growth. It's early days, we're still in the middle of integrating we just closed 18 months ago, but we're very pleased with the results so far. This is the first quarter in which Merck has recorded as part of our organic sales growth rates. It contributed positively to that. It's a real asset to our overall Personal Healthcare business and it's playing out that way. The revenue synergies are on track, the cost synergies are on track with some real exciting examples of the possibility of driving both of those ahead of what our initial plans had that. The organization is a strong organization and they're doing a great job, so, so far really, really good.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nBill Chappell: Thanks, good morning. Jon, just circling back to the Billie acquisition, just a little surprised that I guess P&G thinks that that can pass with the FTC and just with your market share and also with kind of FTC cracking down on it a lot of even recent small acquisitions historically. So kind of any thoughts there on why you're moving forward with that and especially on the US positioning. And then if that's part of a plan, and do you think you got more opportunities to do tuck-ins to where you have 40-50 share of a market?\nJon Moeller: In general, just starting from the strategic level, we want to ensure that we are serving consumers in all relevant segments of the categories that we've chosen to plan. Sometimes, that's easier and more straightforward from an organic standpoint, so if you think about the natural segment, for example, something like Pampers Pure, on the other hand, getting a quick presence in some of these high growth segments or with different groups of consumers, it's sometimes easier to do the acquisition. So if I just \u2013 a good example of this is L on Feminine Care, which is now the number one natural product from a market share standpoint, obviously, very early, but so far has proven to be very strong idea to expand in a very relevant consumer segment very quickly. That's the motivation here. I'm obviously not going to speak to regulatory dynamics or anything related to that. But we're excited about this and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to really work to grow this combined set of categories grow the market and create value.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, good morning. Jon, can you talk a little bit about how you and the board think about valuation in the context of share buybacks. Your results are obviously the best that they've been probably in a decade, but so is the -- appropriately so as the value of your shares. So can you just talk a little bit about valuation in buy back context?\nJon Moeller: Sure, obviously, over the last decade, buybacks have created extraordinary value. But that's been on the back, which is implicit in your question on overtime a significant increase in the stock price. If I look at it today, first of all we don't try to forecast where the market's going to go. We don't pretend that we know that. And so, in general, we feel very strongly about our prospects as a company. There's no reason at present not to feel reasonably good about the market itself and so we're kind of, if you will, dollar cost averaging over time. The other thing that's important, though, is to think about the context of our dividend yield relative to financing rates that are available. Because at some level what you're dealing with is, can I retire a dividend rate with an incremental financing cost that's lower than that rate? And with negative interest rates in many parts of the world, this is a very attractive time to be, if you will, financing share repurchase, we're going to stay within our credit limits as we do that. That's another constraint, if you will, or another rail and we'll continually look at this. Obviously, capital allocation is a broad topic inclusive of every purchase is something that is reviewed regularly with the board and we value their input to that, but the current plan obviously reflects that as we sit here today, I don't have a reason to suggest a change in that plan.\nOperator: And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Hey, Jon, thank you. Are you concerned at all that your business has become more macro sensitive in the past five to 10 years, in some segments of outsized growth would seem to indicate that, but any historical context or consumer data you have that a farmer to spell that I'd appreciate?\nJon Moeller: I think Jon we're actually less sensitive into the macro environment. And that's been a very deliberate choice we've made. Let me explain that. We were in as we went into the last recession as an example, a lot of \u2013 for a number of relatively to highly discretionary product categories. Things like salon hair color, high end premium fragrance, just two examples. And our intentional and strategic part of our portfolio focus was to be instead in daily use categories that are used in good times and bad times because they're just important to get through the day, sometimes multiple use is important to get through the day. So if you look at the total portfolio through that lens, we're more macro resilient, I would argue today than we were some years ago. The second reason I say that is the efforts that we've made and will continue to make and the investment we've put behind it on product superiority, product package, the whole set of drivers that inherently increases consumer value. So the value of each purchase is higher than it would have been even inclusive of small price increases. And that too puts us in a better position relative to things like trade down that can happen as a result of macro dynamics and more difficult economic times. Not immune, but in a better position today. The third thing I would argue is to the extent that we've been successful, and creating a culture where productivity is as integral to our being as innovation. We have more financial flexibility and therefore more degrees of freedom. For how we manage the difficulties that the macro economic situation can present. So for those three reasons Jon I think we're going to \u2013 a much better place today. We will be impacted if there are negative developments in any part of the world. It does create challenge. It's the right question to continue to ask. And I'm not talking in absolutes, but on a relative basis, we're much more macro resilient than I think we were historically. Great, well, thanks everybody again, just a quick summary. We really view this quarter as another step in our journey forward. Strong top line progress, building market share, strong operating earnings growth, building margins, strong core earnings per share, generating cash, returning back cash to shareholders all behind an integrated strategy that's working and we will continue to execute. We look forward to seeing many of you, as I said earlier at CAGNY and I look forward to our conversations. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. As this was another relatively straightforward quarter, and as David Taylor will be with us to provide additional depth at CAGNY in just a few weeks. I'm going to keep prepared remarks this morning brief, turning fairly quickly to your questions. This was another very solid quarter, top line, bottom line and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization strategies. Organic sales up 5%, three points of volume growth, two points of price mix. Two-year stack average growth of 4.5%, fiscal year-to-date organic sales growth of 6%, calendar year 2019 organic growth of 6%. This growth continues to be broad based. Nine of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal Care up double digits, Personal Health Care and Home Care grew high singles, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Grooming grew mid-single digits. Family Care grew low singles. Focus markets and enterprise markets each grew mid singles. We continue to perform very well in our two largest markets, the US up 4% and China up 13% for the quarter, aggregate market share continuing to grow. These results required us to overcome several challenges. While we're seeing real signs of progress with Grooming organic sales up 4% this quarter, we're still working to sustainably improve results in this business and in Baby Care. Sales results in Japan, our third largest market, created nearly a half point drag on total company organic sales growth due to the timing of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1. The timing as we highlighted last quarter, led to higher shipments last quarter and lower shipments in the quarter we just completed. We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets, India, the UK, Australia, Turkey, Iraq, Nigeria, Kenya, Lebanon, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Hong Kong market. Through all of this, we grew organic sales 5% on the quarter and 6% over the first half. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were up 14% versus the prior year. Foreign Exchange was a one point earnings growth headwind, so on a constant currency basis core earnings per share increased 15%. Fiscal year-to-date core earnings per share are up 18%, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin up 200 basis points in the second quarter, core operating margin up 190 basis points, continued strong cash generation, with operating cash flow of $4.4 billion and free cash flow productivity of 100%. $1.9 billion of dividends paid, $3.5 billion of P&G stock repurchased, $5.4 billion of cash returned to shareholders. We'd another strong quarter, solid volume sales and market share trends across both categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareholders. We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and of competitive response to our growth. But all in we're continuing to make progress behind a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. The strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We establish and extend the superiority of our brands. To make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability, reinforce and build on each other. They position as well within our industry to deal with near term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term. Moving to guidance, we're again increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth, for core earnings per share growth and for free cash flow productivity, as well as cash return. We started the year with organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 4%. We increased the range to 3% to 5% last quarter and are now increasing the range to 4% to 5%. This 4% to 5% range compares with underlying market growth of 3% to 4%, implying continued market share growth. On the bottom line our core earnings per share growth guidance started the year at a range of 4% to 9%. We raised the range to 5% to 10% last quarter and we're now increasing the range again to 8% to 11% for the year. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to 95% last quarter and now to 100%. We'll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash returned expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and now increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. While we've delivered strong first half results, please keep in mind that comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both top line and bottom line. Pricing annualizes as we move through the back half of the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the Boston landfill and Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors are responding to our outperformance, which will require continued innovation and equity building investments on our part. And the market level challenges I mentioned earlier will be top and bottom line headwinds for the balance of the year. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not included within the new and improved guidance ranges. We look forward to seeing many of you at the CAGNY conference in just a few weeks. As I mentioned, David Taylor will join us and we'll provide further perspective on forward looking strategies and plans. We look forward to engaging with you into benefiting from your thoughts and reactions. With that I'm happy to take questions. I could complete the whole call there. On the first part of your question, we're very pleased with the top line growth in the quarter that we just completed. As you all know, we delivered 7% as you mentioned in the prior quarter, our guidance was three to five for the full fiscal year, implying something below that beyond the first quarter, and we delivered at the high end of that range. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth was broad based both across categories and regions. And we built market share. From an underlying consumption standpoint, you've seen the uptick numbers, at least through December, which continue to be very strong. And we really haven't seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook kind of first part of the current quarter. So all the fundamentals are there, our superiority levels continue to increase, we're investing behind that while building margins. We're building market share and increasingly the growth is broader as you look at both categories and geographies. We did have some headwinds in the quarter from two items. You mentioned probably three. You mentioned one which is Japan and that had a half point impact which benefited the prior quarter. The other dynamic has been a series and I mentioned this also in my prepared remarks of geopolitical, economic, societal and other impacts in individual markets. I mean, think about what's happened in the last \u2013 well, since we last gathered even. The situation in the Hong Kong market has continued to be difficult, which had a real impact on the quarter and had an impact on the travel retail business. Some of the market level events in South America whether that's Argentina or Chile, where stores were burnt and are not yet back in place. Some of the events that you're very familiar with in our headline items in the Middle East impacted our business as well. And those items will impact us going forward for the balance of the year. I'm very \u2013 we're very pleased that we were able to overcome all of that, and still deliver very strong numbers that built share and build household penetration and allow us to deliver significant bottom line benefits. From a competitive environment standpoint which was the second part of your question. Promotion levels \u2013 percentage of sales in our category sold and promotion are actually down. The index at 98 for the last quarter, that's all I have visibility to. I don't have visibility to the future. And where individual competitors are up versus year ago, they're up typically a point. So very simply and we can get into this later with others if you want more detail. We're not seeing competitive activity that's indicative of downward price spirals by any means. That can change tomorrow, but what we have in front of us today continues to look very healthy. China, we are very optimistic about our prospects in China. It's a difficult market. It moves at a very fast pace both of our consumer and trade channel standpoint. But we continue to increase the rate of growth in that market. You'll recall four years ago, we were at minus one. The following year, we were at plus seven, fusing plus \u2013 minus five, plus one, plus seven, last year plus 10 and fiscal year-to-date of plus 13. So that continues to be a very attractive market within that some really strong growth rates in some categories. I'm talking the high 20% in categories like Skin Care, Feminine Care over 20%, Fabric Care double digits, so generally a very strong market. I have no idea what the developments are going to be relative to the new virus. We're obviously monitoring that closely as it relates both to the health of our employees and broader communities. And we'll have to see what impact that has, if any, on whether this was going forward. But it's one of those things that I do think it's important to mention because it can have broad impacts well beyond China. It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market. It can affect travel, which does affect our business. And so it's one of the many pieces of volatility that's just important we keep front of us as we think about the prospects for the future which I view is generally extremely positive, but not without risking without challenge. Another three parter, I'll try to get to each of the pieces efficiently. Travel retail concentrated in Hong Kong. Beauty broadly continues to do extremely well. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth with Q2 up 8%. That growth is broad based. Healthcare grew 6% of the quarter. Our Skin and Personal business grew to 10%. It was actually a relatively slow quarter for SK-II given both the VAT dynamic in Japan where SK-II has a big business and the Hong Kong dynamics. Skin Care broadly in China, as I mentioned, is doing extraordinarily well. Olay was up strong, strong double digits. And \u2013 but the balance of the business as well. Our Safeguard business, which is part of our beauty, grew double digits, again strong double digits over 20%. So the growth in beauty both on a global basis and within the China market is broad based. I think you asked another question, but I'd don't \u2013 SK-II expansion. Yeah. There are \u2013 so first of all, there are significant opportunities in the markets that we're in as evidenced by the current growth rates. There are also the right time and in the right way, expansion opportunities available. Are there other questions? Let me first talk about Hair Care and I'm assuming the questions is in the China context. We grew Hair Care in the mid to high single digits in China, which is the fastest growth rate in a period of time. And so yes, that can offer some offsets if you will to other businesses that may soften to competitive activity or other things. On the other hand, the Hair Care business is a highly, highly competitive business as are many other categories. So the dynamics can change there quite rapidly. Our job is to continue to steadily increase our margin of superiority. And if we do that, over time, if not quarter-to-quarter, we'll continue to have a strong business. In terms of the conservatism in the back half of the year, I'll answer this question both relative to China which obviously we don't provide specific guidance for and the balance of the company. One thing to keep in mind with China is the timing of Chinese New Year, which is, you know, from all the press on China recently is happening beginning as we speak. And that is earlier in the calendar year than it typically occurs. And so it's likely there was some sell in the OMD period that wouldn't have been there and the prior period. But on a global P&G basis that doesn't move the needle significantly, but something just to be aware of as relates to the China specific situation. I talked in my prepared remarks about some of the headwinds that exist that increase there in the quarter and will impact us in the back half of the year or could impact us in the back half of the year. We talked about the market level dynamics. So if you take a market that may not be that large, but take a market like Chile. That impact happened at the very end of the quarter, and will exist through the balance of the year. The same with, for example, the situation in Lebanon, the same for the situation in Iraq, the Indian market, the growth rates have slowed, still growing and we're doing very well and building chair. But the challenges there have increased and will likely remain for the balance of the year. So that's one reason, one thing that needs to be netted against to strong progress that we hope to continue to make. The other is the annualization of price increases. So for example, in February, we annualize both a Dish Care price increase from year ago and a Family Care price increase from a year ago. And I don't want to talk about how we're going to handle pricing going forward. That's kind of off limits. But regardless though the annualization impacts as well as some of the price increases we've taken for evaluation over the last year will annualize. And third is the competitive environment. And I don't know what that's going to hold. I've described what it's held so far. But most of our calendars \u2013 most of our competitors are calendar year based. They start their new fiscal years as we speak. And many of them have talked, understandably, about increasing investments for growth. That can be a very healthy thing. It can grow categories, we can all benefit from that. But certain implementations of that obviously are less healthy. Now, against all of that backdrop, we continue to make progress on the things that we control or making very strong progress, our margin of superiority is increasing across the board. It's dynamic, it's not static. So we have moves forward and moves back, but the net move is a forward move. We're in a position because of our productivity programs to invest to support communication of that superiority. And that's really driving some outsized growth in many of our categories. And over time and it will take some time. I expect we'll deliver higher growth rates on businesses like Baby Care. So overall, we're very optimistic about where we stand today and what the future holds, at least in the near term, but it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the challenges that exist. Thanks Lauren. And within that one question you've managed to ask three which is very well done. Our Grooming business strengthened in the quarter overall, we were up 4% and that's the third consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, we grew global market share point three points, which is very encouraging. Shaving within that was up versus year ago, not as much as \u2013 I mean not as much as the dry shave business, but the wet shave business did grow. And we've seen pretty strong response to our investments both in products in and communication. Encouragingly, we've added 18 million new users to our brands over the last 12 months. SkinGuard is contributing to category growth; it's doing well and continues to expand. In the US, for example, razor value share on SkinGuard is now 9%, which is a third largest for a P&G sub brand. And we're building unlike most of our competitors our shave business online. We're pretty excited about the Billie acquisition. That's something that obviously needs to pass regulatory clearance. And we need to remain separate from that business until that happens. But there's a real unique set of skills, experiences and knowledge between Billie and P&G that we think has the potential to create some real magic. Clearly, they've created very effectively a fresh new brand that extends across several categories. And they've done it and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one-to-one mass marketing, which is something we're continuing to increase our focus on and capabilities related to. We have innovation capability across the majority of their categories. We have best in class manufacturing across the majority of their categories. And we have a go-to-market presence, both online and brick-and-mortar, certainly in omni channel that can accelerate the growth in that business. So we're very excited about the potential and are working through the clearance process. Thanks, Ali. Obviously, just related to Exedy first, they're talking about a market that we're not competing in. I know that you know that. That is a very different market. It's much more of a commodity market than our primary market from a talent standpoint, which is what I believe they were talking about, which is North America. In general, we see commodity prices as supportive of the current prices in the market. So while they're down some versus kind of historical levels and where we were before the price increases went into effect, we feel the current prices are justified that does not speak to an indication of future activity, I won't go there. And our outlook for those commodities continues to be relatively flat to slight increases, particularly in the in the pulse space. But I don't see the kind of sea change environment that would necessitate activity. Having said that each competitor will do what they choose to do and we need to be responsive to that which gets to your second question. And candidly, we do not have advance notice of the implementation of price increases. And so we are \u2013 decreases sorry, either one. And so we react as we see those in the marketplace. And that reaction time, typically is anywhere from a quarter to six months. So if we think along a reasonable period of time. I don't expect this to be a crippling dynamic or anything resembling that going forward and may cause a quarter of two of odd benefit or hurt, but not a big thing to worry about. Thanks, Wendy. I mentioned as one of our strategic choices, the desire to make productivity as integral to our nature, as innovation, and be leaders in productivity just as we are in innovation. And I think we've made a lot of progress on that journey, as you rightly point out, which is reflected in our margins certainly this quarter. My hope is that as we move forward, this is simply an integral part of our operating strategy. And it needs to be because we will need to continue to invest in \u2013 of holding advancing our margin of superiority. Some of the continuous disruption we're talking about will also require some investment that's in human resources, capital, et cetera. And I feel very good about each of the business units understanding and commitment to continue delivering productivity. So that brings us to another part of the question which is, are there degrees of freedom that enable that to occur? Will is one thing, delivery is another. And I don't think we've ever been in a place where there are more degrees of freedom or more opportunities to improve productivity, the tools that we have available to us now across the digital spectrum and that's everywhere from marketing to the manufacturing floor to the office environment, had never offered more opportunity than they do today. And we have significant opportunities still in terms of how we think about our new organization structure and other opportunities within that as we learn more about it to become even more efficient and effective and I certainly believe they are \u2013 there are. I just attended along with David, a review of our product supply innovation program last week, and there are big opportunities relative to robotics, relative to a tighter sequencing of the entire supply chain from order signal all the way back to delivery where the middle of a sustainable product supply transformation across markets and geographies. So I continue to believe that productivity will be an inherent part of our operating strategy and we have the tools and opportunities to continue to deliver that. A couple of things there Olivia, we've been very clear. I think that while we need to be competitive in the trade spending standpoint and need to offer attractive margins to our retail partners, where we have a degree of flexibility, we would prefer to spend that incremental dollar on advertising or innovation every day of the week. The reason is very simple. There's nothing proprietary and pricing, we can build proprietary advantage with both advertising and innovation. So again, on the margin, where we have the opportunity to make those shifts, we're doing it. And we're doing it in a way that is attractive to our retail partners as well because it drives business and grows categories. The second piece we've talked a lot about, and Marc Pritchard, our Chief Marketing Officer has talked a lot about externally is the opportunity to move what were historically a significant amount of non-working dollars into working and advertising. And that's been about a billion dollar shift and it continues. And the third piece of this is when you have innovation that's noticeably superior. You need to want to ensure would be communicating that superiority and those performance benefits and the value that comes with them to consumers. And the good news is we have a lot of very strong innovation in the marketplace that has a lot of legs left in terms of either just launched or something like paws or beads which have been on the market for a number of years that have significant household penetration opportunities and our pure delighters from a consumption standpoint. We want to be supporting those. I mentioned both as relates to competitive activity, but also in general that we will continue to invest in both equity and innovation as we move forward. Thanks Kevin. It's honestly hard to separate those because if we do our job right from an execution standpoint and an innovation standpoint of a growth, we grow markets, so we don't view market growth as something that is separate from our efforts. It's in many cases, obviously not 100%. But it's caused by our efforts. I realized that's not that helpful to you, but it's an important point. As we back up from that and I look at category growth in China, it continues to be strong in our categories. The one area that's under a little bit of pressure from a category growth stand point is Baby Care and that relates to the birth rates, which have gone from about 15 million babies a year down to 10, which is significant impact. On the other hand, within that category, there are significant premiumization opportunities and the premium part of our business is growing 20% or 30%, depending on whether that's premium tape diapers or pants style diapers, but in general and China the answer on category growth is remains very strong. The answer on if you will P&Gs specific efforts if you pretend for a second that they're not impacting category growth that also is abundant and real. I mean, we've gone \u2013 it's not that the inflection in category growth rate that has changed the results on Skin Care, it's our share of progress within the category, albeit in a very growth full category. So we've gone from declines, perennial declines on that business to perennial gains and strong double digit gains. The improvement in our Hair Care top line is still not what we'd like it to be but definitely improved from where we've been. Is a result of much stronger branding and innovation efforts as well as go-to-market strengthening, so it's hard for me to fuse those apart? The simple answer is it's both and that's a good thing. I'll start where you started. US growth of 4% is indeed very strong and it's building market share. We built market share in the US over the past three, six and 12 months periods. Nine of our 10 categories grew in the US in the last quarter. The one that didn't was either at a 98.5 or 99.5 index. The difference between the quarters reflects a number of things. Part of it is trade inventory, which was reduced as we went through the second quarter. There's initiative timing that impacts this pretty significantly as well. I would expect going forward we're going to continue to see some chop, if we look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But across a slightly longer period of time, we remain very, very happy with the way the business is progressing. And if we look at underlying consumption going back to a discussion earlier in this call that continues to be as you've seen, at least the scanner data, very, very strong. From a Baby Care standpoint, if you look at the first half of the year, Baby Care was flat to up slightly which is a better position we've been in. And it ranges from \u2013 if we look at our two largest markets, China and the US, those are relatively \u2013 again on a relative basis healthy. China in the first half, we grew at 5%. That's the fastest growth where we've had from \u2013 on a semester basis in about six years. We regain market share leadership about two years ago and have continued to hold that. As I mentioned, in the last answer, we're growing our premium business our pants business, very, very strongly. The US we're about flat versus year ago, which again, is an improvement on a relative basis. And what should take both of those businesses as well as the broader Baby Care business to a stronger position is innovation which builds superiority. We have across parts of the portfolio, not been offering a superior product. It's larger than some of those cases of parody product. We have strong innovation plans in place not only in terms of eco mentality, but we really increase the pace of innovation and the amount that's coming to market, a lot of which has driven the China results that I talked about. But innovation, whether it's a Baby Care or Beauty Care, it's not an overnight endeavor and we'll continue to hopefully, improve sequentially as we go forward. We're pretty pleased with the growth rates in the enterprise markets currently. We mentioned mid-single digits. It's really at the border of mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll leave you with that. And that's despite these pretty significant impacts. If you think about two of the largest markets in the enterprise environment are India and Mexico, and I talked about the slowing growth rates in India, largely as a result of some of the monetary policies, which has created a bit of a liquidity squeeze, which is drying up inventory through the system. But we continue to grow well in India and are building share. Mexico's technically, from an economic growth standpoint, in a recession. We continue to grow reasonably well there. We have been single digits and are growing share there as well. So broadly, we continue to be pretty pleased with our progress. And just briefly, even though it wasn't part of your question on the bottom line, we're creating more value in these markets currently then we ever have. So our bottom line progress was strong double digits, well ahead of the company average. We need to be focused on value creation in these markets that includes growth where we can generate a meaningful return and that's what we're focused on doing and there's tons of opportunity. It continues to be a significant opportunity for growth. It's currently growing at about 30%. And in the big ecommerce markets, well, that growth differs across categories. It's pretty much at that level across markets. It is now about 10% of our total business. And what I \u2013 just for clarity when I mention ecommerce, I'm talking obviously the totality of ecommerce which includes omni channel. And our market share in general has been increasing. Of course, there's some volatility to that, but particularly in a china context and again it differs by category. We've been making significant progress in that space, so I see us as very well positioned to succeed in that space, though that's something that requires eternal efforts, flexibility and the constructive disruption of ourselves which we're committed to, to ensure that we offer a competitive and relevant offering, wherever consumers want to shop, whether that's ecommerce, whether that's large format or that's small format. And generally, we're progressing well in each of those. As you probably recall, Merck offers a very complimentary portfolio to our legacy Personal Healthcare P&G business. Has a strong presence in the developing world, complimentary categories across geographies and there were significant we felt cost synergies in addition to revenue synergies by bringing the best of both companies together and driving growth. It's early days, we're still in the middle of integrating we just closed 18 months ago, but we're very pleased with the results so far. This is the first quarter in which Merck has recorded as part of our organic sales growth rates. It contributed positively to that. It's a real asset to our overall Personal Healthcare business and it's playing out that way. The revenue synergies are on track, the cost synergies are on track with some real exciting examples of the possibility of driving both of those ahead of what our initial plans had that. The organization is a strong organization and they're doing a great job, so, so far really, really good. In general, just starting from the strategic level, we want to ensure that we are serving consumers in all relevant segments of the categories that we've chosen to plan. Sometimes, that's easier and more straightforward from an organic standpoint, so if you think about the natural segment, for example, something like Pampers Pure, on the other hand, getting a quick presence in some of these high growth segments or with different groups of consumers, it's sometimes easier to do the acquisition. So if I just \u2013 a good example of this is L on Feminine Care, which is now the number one natural product from a market share standpoint, obviously, very early, but so far has proven to be very strong idea to expand in a very relevant consumer segment very quickly. That's the motivation here. I'm obviously not going to speak to regulatory dynamics or anything related to that. But we're excited about this and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to really work to grow this combined set of categories grow the market and create value. Sure, obviously, over the last decade, buybacks have created extraordinary value. But that's been on the back, which is implicit in your question on overtime a significant increase in the stock price. If I look at it today, first of all we don't try to forecast where the market's going to go. We don't pretend that we know that. And so, in general, we feel very strongly about our prospects as a company. There's no reason at present not to feel reasonably good about the market itself and so we're kind of, if you will, dollar cost averaging over time. The other thing that's important, though, is to think about the context of our dividend yield relative to financing rates that are available. Because at some level what you're dealing with is, can I retire a dividend rate with an incremental financing cost that's lower than that rate? And with negative interest rates in many parts of the world, this is a very attractive time to be, if you will, financing share repurchase, we're going to stay within our credit limits as we do that. That's another constraint, if you will, or another rail and we'll continually look at this. Obviously, capital allocation is a broad topic inclusive of every purchase is something that is reviewed regularly with the board and we value their input to that, but the current plan obviously reflects that as we sit here today, I don't have a reason to suggest a change in that plan. I think Jon we're actually less sensitive into the macro environment. And that's been a very deliberate choice we've made. Let me explain that. We were in as we went into the last recession as an example, a lot of \u2013 for a number of relatively to highly discretionary product categories. Things like salon hair color, high end premium fragrance, just two examples. And our intentional and strategic part of our portfolio focus was to be instead in daily use categories that are used in good times and bad times because they're just important to get through the day, sometimes multiple use is important to get through the day. So if you look at the total portfolio through that lens, we're more macro resilient, I would argue today than we were some years ago. The second reason I say that is the efforts that we've made and will continue to make and the investment we've put behind it on product superiority, product package, the whole set of drivers that inherently increases consumer value. So the value of each purchase is higher than it would have been even inclusive of small price increases. And that too puts us in a better position relative to things like trade down that can happen as a result of macro dynamics and more difficult economic times. Not immune, but in a better position today. The third thing I would argue is to the extent that we've been successful, and creating a culture where productivity is as integral to our being as innovation. We have more financial flexibility and therefore more degrees of freedom. For how we manage the difficulties that the macro economic situation can present. So for those three reasons Jon I think we're going to \u2013 a much better place today. We will be impacted if there are negative developments in any part of the world. It does create challenge. It's the right question to continue to ask. And I'm not talking in absolutes, but on a relative basis, we're much more macro resilient than I think we were historically. Great, well, thanks everybody again, just a quick summary. We really view this quarter as another step in our journey forward. Strong top line progress, building market share, strong operating earnings growth, building margins, strong core earnings per share, generating cash, returning back cash to shareholders all behind an integrated strategy that's working and we will continue to execute. We look forward to seeing many of you, as I said earlier at CAGNY and I look forward to our conversations. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. I know you're very busy this morning, so I'm going to make this very brief, about 10 minutes, and then turn straight to your questions. It's another strong quarter topline, bottom-line, and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization strategies. Organic sales up 7%, four points of volume growth, three points of price mix. Two-year stack growth strengthened into an average of 5.5%. Over the last five quarters, two-year average growth has accelerated 2.5%, 3%, 3%, 4%, now 5.5%. Growth continues to be broad-based. Each global category grew organic sales. Personal Care up mid-teens, Personal Health Care grew double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care, and Oral Care each grew high singles, Hair Care grew mid-singles. Each geographic region grew organic sales 4% or more. Focus markets and enterprise markets each up high singles. Our two largest markets the U.S., up 6%; China, up 13%. Japan another large market was up double-digits due in part to the timing benefit of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1st. E-commerce sales grew over 30%. All channel consumption remained ahead of underlying markets driving aggregate market share growth. Moving to the bottom-line, core earnings per share was $1.37, up 22% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $50 million after-tax headwind about $0.02 per share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share was up 24%. Very strong underlying earnings progress; core gross margin, up 190 basis points; core operating margin, up 260 basis points; continued strong cash flow with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 91%; $1.9 billion of dividends paid; $3 billion of P&G stock repurchased. In summary, a very strong quarter, solid volume, sales, and market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth, and continued high levels of cash returned to shareowners. We continue to face challenges from a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and from competitive response to our faster growth, but we're making progress behind integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. We focused and strengthened our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, in categories where we occupy a number one or number two position which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable. If you're in categories where performance drives brand choice, you better perform. We made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value in all price tiers where we compete, strengthening the short- and long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We are extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution. Additional investment will be needed to sustain this progress. The need for this investment the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the continued importance of productivity; cost out cash in; driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program; expecting strong free cash flow productivity from working capital and CapEx efficiency. Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with a rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation, revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain. We're disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of our learning through lean innovation. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact. We are disrupting in retail execution. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology. We continue to disrupt our supply chain with transformation across the globe. Finally, we're making organization structure and culture changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization focusing effort, clarifying responsibility, increasing accountability, and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives. On July 1st, we officially moved to a new organization structure designed to de-matrix the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We're operating in six industry-based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets what we call the focus markets which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of the company's profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets. We continue to invest in enterprise markets which have very attractive market growth rates. Our organizational structure there is being optimized to accelerate growth top and bottom-line in the dynamic macro environments that those markets present. The benefit of this design is the creation of a more focused, agile, accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, moving at the speed of the market. I hope it continues to be evident that we've been successfully disrupting P&G. The choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain, and to improve organization focus, agility, and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. They position us well within our industry to deal with near-term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid, and long-term. Moving now to guidance. We're raising our outlook on each key metric: organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth and free cash flow productivity. We're increasing our outlook for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 4% to a range of 3% to 5%. The markets in which we compete are growing at a 3% to 3.5% pace, so the midpoint of the higher organic sales range implies continued market share growth. On the bottom line, we're raising our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 4% to 9% to a range of 5% to 10%. This reflects very strong first quarter results and our expectation of solid margin expansion for the year. We're raising our outlook for free cash flow productivity from 90% to 95% for the fiscal year. The year will continue along track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of P&G shares in fiscal 2020. While our first quarter results enable us to raise fiscal year targets, please keep in mind that the comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both on the top line and the bottom line. Quarter year-ago top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7% as we progress through last fiscal year; bottom line 3%, 5%, 6%, 17%. Japan VAT-related timing impacts benefited Q1 company sales results by 30 basis points to 40 basis points but will cause a headwind in Q2. Pricing annualizes as we move through the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the loss of land sale and the Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors will likely respond to our outperformance, which underscores the need for continued investment and superiority. Brexit uncertainty and volatility in foreign exchange Argentina and Turkey for example will be impacting the balance of year results. Our revised guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within the new and improved guidance ranges. With that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to ask a little bit about the build for profitability. And in particular, you know an area I've been really focused on is operating leverage and as you're showing this really as you put it new and improved top line growth performance. So this quarter much of the upside was driven by in fact positive operating leverage. And yet productivity despite you calling out the importance of it ongoing in your script was quite, quite low relative to historical quarterly performance. So can you just talk a little bit, I guess, about the outlook for productivity this year? And how we should think about operating leverage? Because it accelerated sequentially even with kind of a comparable revenue performance sequentially. So, just how to kind of work through the math on operating leverage on the stronger top line. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: A stronger top line definitely provides greater operating leverage, as you rightly point out. We had about 50 points of -- 50 basis points of leverage within the gross margin improvement of 190 basis points. And we had an additional 180 basis points of sales leverage between gross and operating. So, 230 basis points overall against a margin improvement on an operating level of 260 basis points. And I think that's \u2013 generally, if we grow the rule of thumb is if we grow 4%, we should have 50 basis points to 75 basis points of leverage. That increases pretty significantly as we move up the curve beyond 4% and you saw that in the quarter we just completed. Productivity continues to be a significant focus area. Some of our savings are backloaded as we go through this year. But again, they'll be comping significantly higher earnings numbers in the base periods. There are still very large opportunities in front of us: efficiencies in media, efficiencies in organization design, significant savings as we bring on fully the product supply transformation and big opportunities top and bottom line from increasing digitization of our efforts all around.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks and congratulations on a strong start to the year. Geez lots of questions still on the table. Let me start with growth. I guess, my one question with you out there in terms of market growth. Jon you mentioned in your script that you expect price contribution to wane as the year progresses and you comped last year's price gains which I think is intuitively understandable for all of us. But you're pegging your full year guidance to a market growth rate of just 3% to 3.5%, which presumably that market growth is going to experience that same phenomenon of waning price growth. So my question is, is it reasonable to assume that market growth also slows with price moderation? Or are you seeing and do you expect to see a pickup in terms of volume mix contribution both for your firm in aggregate like we saw this quarter and the market overall?\nJon Moeller: Thanks Jason. We do expect to -- we've seen -- the underlying market growth rates there has been a price component as you rightly point out that should annualize itself as you rightly point out. But there's also been an increase in the volume component of market growth. So we are seeing an increase on the margin and market growth in the units. And that should continue as we progress forward. In terms of our own top line algorithm, price was one point of the seven in the quarter. So if you assume that completely annualizes that's one point impact.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jon I was hoping you could take a step back and talk a little bit more broadly about what you're seeing with regard to consumer demand and competition in three markets if I could: Russia, China and Brazil? Is there anything you're seeing now that concerns you in terms of competitive activity or waning demand in any of those -- in any of your key categories in those markets? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: That was Russia, Brazil, China. Generally, Steve across the board, we are seeing continued consumer strength. And generally across the board, we are seeing the levels of healthy competition that you would generally expect. If I take the markets in question. China we were up 13% in the quarter. Market growth rates continued to be strong. It's a very competitive environment always has been, likely will be for the foreseeable future just given the opportunity and the size of price. And that's both local competition and multinational competition. But we haven't seen any significant uptick in the levels of competition. It's always on always strong in a market like China. The consumer in China continues to respond to premium innovation that performs in categories where performance drives brand choice and we see that time and time again on both sides of the ledger. In terms of the other markets that you mentioned, consumer demand in Brazil continues to be strong and respond to strong innovation. But it's -- I would describe it as more volatile and more fickle than for example China. Our growth rates in Brazil vary pretty dramatically by quarter but generally continue to be strong. In the quarter we just completed we grew 2% in Brazil. But prior to that we were growing at significantly higher rates; I don't view that 2% as a slowdown in consumer as much as I do just inherent variability and volatility of that business. And Russia continues to perform as well. We grew the business 5% in the quarter in Russia. From a competitive standpoint, again those markets are very strong as it relates to competition, nothing specific to note.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: Hi, guys. So I just had a couple of questions if I could. One is just actually the broader question here is on sustainability of such strong results. And I guess you're guiding throughout to a little bit of slowdown lapping tough numbers et cetera. So I was hoping you could give some more color, a little bit about two pieces in particular and you touched on it a moment ago. But just more around pricing, particularly pricing as commodities perhaps are rolling over here and you have less of a cost justified reason to take the pricing up. And secondly in terms of the volumes you mentioned certainly growth in the category from unit\u2019s perspective, but your unit growth is outsized. And I just wonder how much of that is from what we're actually seeing on shelf, which is more shelf space growth. So how just kind of same-store sales same square foot sales versus growth from a shelf space perspective? That's a sustainability question. And a sub-question to that is you, obviously, like everybody else have some really good categories more than really good right now, really good businesses and some that aren't doing so well, obviously, Grooming regarding some pieces of Baby Care et cetera. I'm trying to figure out whether you're seeing different retailer reactions or interactions with you given your haves and have not-type categories. I understand you have fewer categories than perhaps most that aren\u2019t firing on all cylinders, but are you seeing that retailers pull different levers when things aren't growing the way they'd like to be? Thanks very much.\nJon Moeller: First, as it relates to sustainability of the results. Comp issues aside and the comp issues are -- or the comp dynamic is obviously real and prevalent and increasingly prevalent as we progress through the fiscal year. We've really tried to ensure two things are an inherent part of how we think about the business and operate the business and both lend themselves to sustainability of results over the long-term. The first is balance across the top and bottom line. I think you saw in the quarter that we just reported, it's a very balanced quarter in terms of strong growth on both. And to the extent that we can continue to deliver both, which we're committed to do the overall value creation result becomes much more sustainable. We've witnessed periods of time in our company and certainly within the industry and adjacent industries where the focus has disproportionately shifted, for example, to the bottom line. That is not a sustainable strategy in our view. And we've seen instances certainly in our own experience where focus has shifted disproportionately to the top line, which also is not a sustainable strategy in our view. So the balancing of the top and bottom line does lead to an expectation of more sustainable value creation delivery. The second piece is probably even more important and that is how we\u2019re thinking about sources of growth. And we're really trying as part of our superiority strategy to source growth through creation of business in the marketplace by driving market growth. That is a much more sustainable and generally more profitable way to drive our business. We\u2019re creating business not taking business from others. And when you are the driver of market growth, you will mathematically build share. So those two concepts are not incongruent. They're in complete congruence. And the question is how do you most sustainably and profitably build share? And we're now contributing to market growth at rates above our market share, which is exactly where we want to be, but that's important to the dynamics that I just described. It's also much more meaningful and relevant to our retail partners. They frankly could care less about P&G market share gains. What they care about is the overall market basket and the margins that they earn on that basket. So both of those focuses from a business model standpoint should conceptually increase the sustainability of our results. We'll have to demonstrate that in the marketplace. But certainly over the last five quarters if you look at the top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 7% doesn't guarantee anything in the future but it's been sustainable progress at least for a period of time. Relative to pricing, we -- I want to be careful on commenting on future pricing activities. What I would say is that to date, we feel good about the pricing that we've taken both as it relates to commodities and as it relates to foreign exchange and some of the developing markets. But that's something we look at on a category country basis every morning when we make up, and we'll adjust as we need to. Relative to the source of volume growth, I mentioned a significant portion of our growth is coming through creation of new business. There is as well and you're right to point out increase in distribution as you would expect given the demonstrated ability to grow markets for our retail partners. But those two things are not separable. And we've talked previously about the retail view of P&G, which has improved significantly, earning top consumer, products manufacturer at Walmart, really across the board and increasing \u2013 you saw the Advantage Monitor, survey where we're number one in our industry across all metrics that are measured and number one by a significant margin. We need to keep improving that. That's not any guarantee for success tomorrow but it is one of the reasons coupled with demonstrated ability to grow markets in many categories that we are increasing the level of distribution. And I don't see that as a step-function curve. I think it has room to continue to grow. Obviously to the extent that we demonstrate the same dynamic across more categories that's another driver of future growth.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning, guys. So sticking to the subject of top line growth and sustainability, I was hoping you'd give us an update on what you saw in fiscal Q1 in terms of a competitive response both on the pricing front as well as in terms of marketing spend from your key competitors given your market share gains. And give us a sense of what you're assuming in guidance in the balance of the year from a competitive environment standpoint, if the environment heats up as you cycle some of these price increases and theoretically competitors look to regain some share momentum.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Dara. You've certainly heard and not surprisingly competition talking about reinvesting in their businesses. I think that's driven by two things. One is the turnover of a generation of leadership in many of our competitive set. And two is the result situation that, we've been talking about together here this morning. We have not seen anything destructive in a mass aggregate scale in the market place from a competitive standpoint. We operate in very competitive industries so that doesn't change. But there hasn't been a step-function increase for example in the level of volume that's being sold on promotion. There has been increased initiative activity innovation driven. That's generally constructive for market growth. So we support that and we'll see. I do expect generally competition to increase as we continue going through the fiscal year. And remember, the time that exist between when you state an intent and when you can actually execute in the market is not short. It's relatively long, just given shelf set dynamics at retail, execution dynamics associated with for example innovation. So I wouldn't say that, we've seen everything that we're going to see. We're in a better position to deal with that than we've been in a long time given increasing percentage of our sales that are superior from a product package communication go-to-market standpoint. We still have work to do, which is why we're going to continue to invest and fund that through productivity. And that's our best defense.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper in some category specifics there. So, curious your thoughts about, what you're seeing in kind of real time in paper goods and competitive dynamics in laundry. It seems like you've had kind of the strongest volume growth on very strong comparisons there. Pricing maybe dipped a little bit sequentially underlying. I'm just curious, if that's a competitive response if that's proactive. Is there something in the market that's kind of changed? Just sort of there any color there will be helpful on those categories. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Laundry had a very strong quarter, up 8% driven by momentum really across the globe. We continue to advance the premium segment both laundry and fabric enhancers. Global value share was up about 0.5 point. Our growth on those premium segments, which include single-unit dose and scent beads, was high-teens and that's \u2013 that's really e-commerce sales up almost 50%. So, really what we're seeing there is innovation-driven, superiority-driven, market-growth-accretive growth, which to the point of the earlier question I expect would be sustainable at some level. And that's what I think about when I think about the laundry and fabric enhancer's category not a specific competitive dynamic. We continue to grow the paper businesses at very high levels in aggregate. And that segment, because of its \u2013 those segments because of their capital intensity are a little bit more responsive from a competitive dynamic standpoint to a variety of factors. But again, I would characterize the landscape as innovation-driven superiority-driven market-accretive growth. Think about \u2013 let's take one of those businesses Feminine Care as an example. Feminine Care in a quarter we grew 7% and that's composed of both strong growth on our base feminine protection business and high-teens level growth on our adult incontinence business. And we had an objective as we entered that category to source our growth through increased market growth. And we essentially doubled the rate of market growth for the adult incontinence category across the geographies where we've entered. So, again that is the predominance or the character of the landscape and the growth drivers as I see it.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Good morning. My question has to do with the U.S. market the U.S. consumer and it's less about pricing than it is maybe the mix of your businesses and brands. If the U.S. consumer is going to slow number one, do you think you see that coming early enough to react and to make sure that the fact that so many of your brands are relatively premium priced in your categories don't cede share? So, I guess the question is on brands, like Luvs or Gain, are you thinking about doing more innovation there more, promotion there, more feature displays? Or is it a pack size issue? In other words, if the economy slows how do you make sure that people don't feel pinched and trade down from some of your more premium-priced brands? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: In terms of predicting any kind of consumer acceleration or consumer slowdown, we really \u2013 we aren't in that business. There are many things that can affect consumer confidence that are things we wouldn't even have the ability to anticipate today, certain geopolitical events, certain political developments within a country, et cetera. So your guess is as good as ours in terms of what market growth does going forward. We have seen no signs of weakness. We have seen continued sequential improvement on the margin. But that can change pretty quickly as we've all witnessed during our lifetimes. We are better positioned today for several reasons to deal with a downturn than we were for example in 2007, 2008. Number one, we are largely out of highly discretionary categories. This was part and parcel of our thinking as we moved to daily-use categories, categories that consumers are much less likely to go without on a daily basis. Generally, we don't see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession. To your point, they may trade down and I'll come to that in a second. But from a category standpoint and a portfolio composition standpoint, we are much better positioned than we were previously. That's number one. Number two, as we've been talking about throughout this call, we are much better positioned from a brand advantage standpoint. The products performing at noticeable levels of superiority in terms of meeting very important consumer needs and desires. And that is a major contributor to the overall value equation that consumers use as they assess their brand choice. There are two portfolio matters: So we've moved not only into daily-use categories but into categories where performance drives brand choice. And we're continuing to invest to build that advantage which is no guarantee but does increase the resilience of the portfolio to headwinds from a consumer standpoint. Third, we've worked to improve the pricing ladders, the availability of product at different price points, different pack sizes. That also is not a guarantee. But you put all of that together, again no guarantees but we're in a much better place. We will use tools like value messaging, like pack sizes, like performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we're as best positioned for consumers who are in a pinch.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Steve Strycula with UBS.\nSteve Strycula: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So I have a question on supply chain in click and collect and the rise of online with that \u2013 how that impacts your business. Specifically, wanted to understand, as you see in stores require more and more inventory for stuff going out the side of the door, how do we think about that impacting your categories? Are you reducing your SKU count at all? How does that impact the weeks of supply in stock throughout the supply chain? Because we've noticed over, let's call it the last two years, most CPG companies have been reporting the national retailers are bringing down these weeks of supply. Would you say they were kind of like near a bottom, especially in a portfolio like Proctor, where you're seeing the sales productivity lift much higher? Should we expect a \u2013 you talk rate a little bit differently than the peer set? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: We want to be SKU efficient and have the right assortment at the shelf both in terms of serving the consumer and in terms of the right turnover for our retail partners. Nothing has really changed in that context. Relative to the trade inventory situation, I think we mentioned on the last call, a slight increase in inventories across the retail channel not consistently but in aggregate to support the things that you are describing as well as a commitment from a delivery standpoint to have product available for consumers on shorter and shorter notice, which requires higher inventories. In the quarter that we just \u2013 that \u2013 we saw that dynamic in the fourth quarter of last year. Those inventory levels have generally remained but we haven't seen any significant change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Just want to follow up on your comp \u2013 you were discussing about driving growth or creating businesses new categories. And you've obviously shown your ability across your portfolio with that. So can you talk a little bit about what's changed in terms of R&D, your market research processes, your marketing processes, the change in your reporting structure that's driven that change? Are there more people external partnerships? How does the reporting structure potentially change? How does that restructure change help aid that? If you could just dive into that a little bit more that would be great. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: That's a big question, Olivia. I'll do my best. First, every category needs to be working to create additional sources of market growth within their \u2013 within the definitions of their existing category and in adjacencies relative to their existing category and that's going to be the predominant source of our growth. And whether that's a fabric enhancer, bead execution, whether that's a laundry single-unit dose execution both of which have significantly inflected market growth rates just as two examples. Some of the initiatives in our Beauty business are doing the same efforts in Power Oral Care as a way to grow markets really across the world. So that is a continuation of what we've been trying to do. And then we've added to that what we call PG Ventures, which is a innovation effort outside of existing categories and we brought products to market like Zevo, which is a natural insecticide. We're working across five or six pretty exciting opportunities that have come out of PG Ventures. That reports to Mary Lynn Ferguson. So it doesn't report into each and every category like she coordinates those efforts for us along with our outside venture partners. From a overall standpoint, whether it's internal innovation to drive superiority to drive market growth or innovation in P&G Ventures, we're operating much more through the lens of lean innovation which simplistically we could spend a day on that. But simplistically is designed to deliver faster, better learning, more shots on goal to increase the chance of breaking through and really having something meaningful to bring to market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on the strong result. Jon, I want to come back to the U.S. and maybe drill down a little bit on some of the channel dynamics. So obviously another really strong result: organic sales growth up 6% in the U.S. but probably like 3x roughly the market growth rate, which I would estimate is probably closer to 2. And looking at the scanner data that's probably about 300 basis points higher, so it looks like that gap is widening and understanding obviously online is growing quite rapidly. I think it was up mid-20s. I missed it this quarter. I apologize for that. Maybe you could provide us that number. But the questions would be number one any timing benefit that will potentially reverse out in the upcoming quarter? And then maybe spend a little bit of time on discussing some of the channel dynamics between tracked versus non-tracked that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Kevin. The tracked number as you know was effectively 3% in the U.S. for the quarter. And as you cited, the overall number was about 6%. That delta is almost entirely due to faster growth rates in non-tracked channels. I mentioned global growth from a e-commerce standpoint at 30%. So customers like Amazon are growing at higher rates than some others. But also for example the club channel is growing at rates that are above the rate of market growth. There are not significant one-timers within the quarter in the U.S. The one significant one-timer that is in our aggregate results is the sell in ahead of the VAT increase, which went into effect on October 1 in Japan. That had about a 30 or 40 basis point impact on our numbers.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning. Just echoing the congrats. So I was hoping Jon if you can comment a bit more on China where you grew 13%, you accelerated from 12% in the last quarter. But you faced tough comps ahead. So do you think it's -- growth is still driven by SK-II and Olay or is it more broad-based now into hair and other categories? So are you worried about your comps is getting tougher starting in this quarter or -- and related to that you comment on price in baby is still being deflationary. So when do you think you can cycle that process and offset with more premium diapers growth? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: We're always concerned about comps getting tougher, always working to run harder. That's a part of the world that we live in. Generally, it is not just for example SK-II and Olay which are growing at fantastic rates in China, but our growth profile across the categories has broadened significantly. You mentioned Baby Care. We were up high single-digits in Baby Care in the quarter very strong response to the innovation that we've brought to market. We are growing generally across the board. The one exception which has improved significantly is Hair Care. In Hair Care, we had very modest growth, but that's an improvement versus where we've been the last couple of quarters. So everything's on the rise in China. I feel -- we feel good about our prospects there. For perspective, if you look at China ex Olay and SK-II, we grew 9% in the quarter. So there is much more to the story than just those two businesses though we're very happy with the story on those two businesses.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nGrant O'Brien: Hi. This is actually Grant on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one on Latin America and in particular Mexico. We've heard from some other companies that the consumer has slowed maybe a little bit there. I was wondering if you were seeing the same thing or any other changes in that market in particular? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: We have been seeing something similar. But frankly consumption in the month of September was very strong and we ended up with top line growth rates at very attractive level in Mexico for the last quarter at 10%.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you, good morning. Jon I wanted to circle back on your Beauty business and just really understand how sustainable the strong growth that you're seeing out of that business. How confident you are that this can continue especially as the comps get tougher? Maybe you could help us understand what it will be driven by. Is it better and stronger innovation? If so can you give us some examples maybe of what's been working. And then give us a sense of the levels of innovation in your pipeline this year versus last year. And then finally maybe help us understand why some of your innovation seem to be better resonating with the consumer ultimately driving what I assume to be share gains? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: One thing that gives us confidence about continued success in Beauty are the sustainability of the results we've been delivering is the breadth of those results. And I think as I reflect on several of the conversations that we've had together there's a bit of a misunderstanding that it's all driven by SK-II and that just isn't the case. So we grew hair, our Hair Care business mid single-digits in the last quarter. We grew that business at 6% in the U.S. All aspects of our Skin and Personal Care business are growing. Our Personal Care business which is deodorants and body washes and those kinds of products grew at 10% in the quarter. Obviously, Skin Care and SK-II grew at even higher rates than that. If I looked just at SK-II it's one -- it's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio. Our new user attraction continues to be our focus. And as long as we keep that door open, we should continue to grow and that's been happening. But again breadth of success across Beauty.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thanks, good morning everyone. Jon I was hoping you can talk about the big dialogue that's been over the last few years, big brands versus small brands. And I was wondering if you could just kind of give us your perspective on this whole next-day same-day delivery battle between Amazon and Walmart and other retailers kind of getting into the fray now. And how that impacts big brands versus small brands in the sense of supply chain integrity and things like that? So maybe you could just give us some thoughts around that dynamic?\nJon Moeller: I'm not sure I know Nik exactly what the impact is going to be on those two subsets of businesses, small brands versus large brands directly as a result of what you just described. What I have felt for a long time, what we have felt for a long time and have been talking about for a long time is the relevance -- the continued relevance of large brands, as well as the relevance of small brands in certain instances across our ecosystem. Our large brands historically have grown about 4 points faster than our small brands. And when you look at the absolute growth that comes from that, it's significantly higher. But large -- every large brand started off as a small brand and so we can't ignore that dynamic either. As you know, we've been buying and building some smaller brands to serve some rapidly growing consumer segments particularly in the natural space, but not confined to that. I generally think -- we generally think that the ecosystem as we move forward at minimum does not disadvantage big brands. And I can make pretty strong arguments for why it should advantage big brands. When you think about e-commerce as the fastest growing channel in many -- well certainly in our two largest markets in the U.S. and China and the dynamic of big brands versus small brands in that environment. It disproportionately favors big brands, not at the exclusion of small brands by any means, but certainly doesn't disadvantage big brands. And I'd be happy to talk for hours about that, but I will spare the group that diatribe right here. But generally, we feel that both large brands and small brands will have relevance moving forward. There is nothing structurally or a from a society standpoint that disadvantages big brands particularly and this important when you focus your portfolio on categories where performance drives brand choice. There are very few consumers that sit in front of a physical or virtual shelf and how ask how large a brand is? They're wondering, how well it will to do the job they're buying it to do and will it meet their needs and solve their problems?\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.\nCaroline Levy: Good morning and thank you very much. Jon I wonder, if you could dive in a little deeper into Grooming and talk about what you found is working, which regions it's working in? And how you think about the future? I mean it's -- is there any opportunity to return to growth in this business for you and what's the plan?\nJon Moeller: Definitely, opportunities to return to growth, in fact, we've been growing albeit modestly. Each of the last two quarters we grew on a global basis. If you think about -- I mean, there are number of reasons to be positive going forward. One is, the growth potential that exists in developing markets and the mix potential that exists in those markets as people move up potentially from a double edge or disposables use into systems use. Strong opportunity to further penetrate, though, the double-edge and disposable businesses, particularly in some of the developing markets where for example a lot of the shaves are executed in the context of a barber. So significant opportunities for growth, we're also seeing a very strong response to our newest innovation which is designed to address one of the major barriers to shave and that's skin irritation. And for many men this is a significant issue. This isn't a minor issue. And it literally prevents them from shaving more frequently. So SkinGuard is designed to address that need and increase as a result the frequency of shave and the number of people who do shave. And we've doubled the rate of razor growth with that entry in Europe. If you look at consumer ratings on that product in the U.S., they're very strong. I think they're 4.5, 4.6. And the retailer reaction in terms of space allocation has been very favorable. There are also significant opportunities to address the needs of men who choose not to shave and that's where we're also spending a lot of incremental effort to make sure that we're meeting his needs. And if we do that in a superior way, for both shavers and non-shavers, this category will grow and it's extraordinarily profitable.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Jon, earlier on I think you mentioned that in aggregate you had seen some pickup in demand, I think, maybe from roughly 3% to 3% to 3.5%. Could you perhaps be -- give us a little bit more detail in terms of which countries you see somewhat better demand than over, let's say, the last 12 months and which categories? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: The U.S. is front and center and that's generally across categories, with Grooming being an exception.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.\nJon Andersen: Hey, thanks. Just a quick one. Personal Healthcare was up double digits in the quarter. You did mention that there was some benefit from presets by retailers about the cough-cold season. How much of a benefit was that? I mean, was that just kind of a comp issue relative to last year? Are they planning for a stronger season this year? And then if you could talk briefly about the integration of the Merck business.\nJon Moeller: Acquisition of -- or integration of the Merck business is going very well and a quick thank you to all those who are involved in that effort. We continue to grow that business at very attractive rates and continue to grow our heritage P&G Personal Healthcare business at very attractive rates. As you said, the total grew double digits in the quarter. If anything, if my knowledge is correct, it may not be, but if anything we saw, a slower buy in ahead of the season of this year as compared to, for example, last year, but certainly not a significant impact either way.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Edward Lewis with Atlantic Equities. \nEdward Lewis: Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to drill down into Europe, because I guess you're close to start where you suggests all geographic regions are growing at 4% or more. I guess, Europe's included with that. And, I guess, things really haven't been that great of late. So I was just wondering, it's a tougher operating environment. You've got lots of regions to survey or to execute against. And you've rolled out the -- your focus on superiority and end-to-end SBU strategy a bit later. But it does seems as though the market share trends and the underlying growth rate seems to be improving over here as well.\nJon Moeller: Europe is definitely included in the characterization of all regions growing at 4% or more. Our big focus markets in Europe grew at 4% during the quarter. The more developing parts of Europe grew at 5% during the quarter. Really broad growth across countries within Europe: Germany, for example, up 6%; Russia up 5%; the combination of France and the U.K. up 2% to 3%. So we're seeing certainly growth ahead of the market in Europe. We built share -- our share position very nicely over the past 12, six, three and one-month period. So we're very happy with our performance there.\nJon Moeller: I want to thank everybody. I know this is a busy morning with a number of companies reporting, so thank you for your time. John, Katie and I are available the balance of the day to answer any questions that you have to the best of our ability. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. I know you're very busy this morning, so I'm going to make this very brief, about 10 minutes, and then turn straight to your questions. It's another strong quarter topline, bottom-line, and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization strategies. Organic sales up 7%, four points of volume growth, three points of price mix. Two-year stack growth strengthened into an average of 5.5%. Over the last five quarters, two-year average growth has accelerated 2.5%, 3%, 3%, 4%, now 5.5%. Growth continues to be broad-based. Each global category grew organic sales. Personal Care up mid-teens, Personal Health Care grew double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care, and Oral Care each grew high singles, Hair Care grew mid-singles. Each geographic region grew organic sales 4% or more. Focus markets and enterprise markets each up high singles. Our two largest markets the U.S., up 6%; China, up 13%. Japan another large market was up double-digits due in part to the timing benefit of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1st. E-commerce sales grew over 30%. All channel consumption remained ahead of underlying markets driving aggregate market share growth. Moving to the bottom-line, core earnings per share was $1.37, up 22% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $50 million after-tax headwind about $0.02 per share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share was up 24%. Very strong underlying earnings progress; core gross margin, up 190 basis points; core operating margin, up 260 basis points; continued strong cash flow with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 91%; $1.9 billion of dividends paid; $3 billion of P&G stock repurchased. In summary, a very strong quarter, solid volume, sales, and market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth, and continued high levels of cash returned to shareowners. We continue to face challenges from a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and from competitive response to our faster growth, but we're making progress behind integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. We focused and strengthened our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, in categories where we occupy a number one or number two position which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable. If you're in categories where performance drives brand choice, you better perform. We made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value in all price tiers where we compete, strengthening the short- and long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We are extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution. Additional investment will be needed to sustain this progress. The need for this investment the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the continued importance of productivity; cost out cash in; driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program; expecting strong free cash flow productivity from working capital and CapEx efficiency. Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with a rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation, revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain. We're disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of our learning through lean innovation. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact. We are disrupting in retail execution. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology. We continue to disrupt our supply chain with transformation across the globe. Finally, we're making organization structure and culture changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization focusing effort, clarifying responsibility, increasing accountability, and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives. On July 1st, we officially moved to a new organization structure designed to de-matrix the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We're operating in six industry-based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets what we call the focus markets which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of the company's profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets. We continue to invest in enterprise markets which have very attractive market growth rates. Our organizational structure there is being optimized to accelerate growth top and bottom-line in the dynamic macro environments that those markets present. The benefit of this design is the creation of a more focused, agile, accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, moving at the speed of the market. I hope it continues to be evident that we've been successfully disrupting P&G. The choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain, and to improve organization focus, agility, and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. They position us well within our industry to deal with near-term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid, and long-term. Moving now to guidance. We're raising our outlook on each key metric: organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth and free cash flow productivity. We're increasing our outlook for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 4% to a range of 3% to 5%. The markets in which we compete are growing at a 3% to 3.5% pace, so the midpoint of the higher organic sales range implies continued market share growth. On the bottom line, we're raising our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 4% to 9% to a range of 5% to 10%. This reflects very strong first quarter results and our expectation of solid margin expansion for the year. We're raising our outlook for free cash flow productivity from 90% to 95% for the fiscal year. The year will continue along track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of P&G shares in fiscal 2020. While our first quarter results enable us to raise fiscal year targets, please keep in mind that the comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both on the top line and the bottom line. Quarter year-ago top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7% as we progress through last fiscal year; bottom line 3%, 5%, 6%, 17%. Japan VAT-related timing impacts benefited Q1 company sales results by 30 basis points to 40 basis points but will cause a headwind in Q2. Pricing annualizes as we move through the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the loss of land sale and the Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors will likely respond to our outperformance, which underscores the need for continued investment and superiority. Brexit uncertainty and volatility in foreign exchange Argentina and Turkey for example will be impacting the balance of year results. Our revised guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within the new and improved guidance ranges. With that, I'm happy to take your questions. A stronger top line definitely provides greater operating leverage, as you rightly point out. We had about 50 points of -- 50 basis points of leverage within the gross margin improvement of 190 basis points. And we had an additional 180 basis points of sales leverage between gross and operating. So, 230 basis points overall against a margin improvement on an operating level of 260 basis points. And I think that's \u2013 generally, if we grow the rule of thumb is if we grow 4%, we should have 50 basis points to 75 basis points of leverage. That increases pretty significantly as we move up the curve beyond 4% and you saw that in the quarter we just completed. Productivity continues to be a significant focus area. Some of our savings are backloaded as we go through this year. But again, they'll be comping significantly higher earnings numbers in the base periods. There are still very large opportunities in front of us: efficiencies in media, efficiencies in organization design, significant savings as we bring on fully the product supply transformation and big opportunities top and bottom line from increasing digitization of our efforts all around. Thanks Jason. We do expect to -- we've seen -- the underlying market growth rates there has been a price component as you rightly point out that should annualize itself as you rightly point out. But there's also been an increase in the volume component of market growth. So we are seeing an increase on the margin and market growth in the units. And that should continue as we progress forward. In terms of our own top line algorithm, price was one point of the seven in the quarter. So if you assume that completely annualizes that's one point impact. That was Russia, Brazil, China. Generally, Steve across the board, we are seeing continued consumer strength. And generally across the board, we are seeing the levels of healthy competition that you would generally expect. If I take the markets in question. China we were up 13% in the quarter. Market growth rates continued to be strong. It's a very competitive environment always has been, likely will be for the foreseeable future just given the opportunity and the size of price. And that's both local competition and multinational competition. But we haven't seen any significant uptick in the levels of competition. It's always on always strong in a market like China. The consumer in China continues to respond to premium innovation that performs in categories where performance drives brand choice and we see that time and time again on both sides of the ledger. In terms of the other markets that you mentioned, consumer demand in Brazil continues to be strong and respond to strong innovation. But it's -- I would describe it as more volatile and more fickle than for example China. Our growth rates in Brazil vary pretty dramatically by quarter but generally continue to be strong. In the quarter we just completed we grew 2% in Brazil. But prior to that we were growing at significantly higher rates; I don't view that 2% as a slowdown in consumer as much as I do just inherent variability and volatility of that business. And Russia continues to perform as well. We grew the business 5% in the quarter in Russia. From a competitive standpoint, again those markets are very strong as it relates to competition, nothing specific to note. First, as it relates to sustainability of the results. Comp issues aside and the comp issues are -- or the comp dynamic is obviously real and prevalent and increasingly prevalent as we progress through the fiscal year. We've really tried to ensure two things are an inherent part of how we think about the business and operate the business and both lend themselves to sustainability of results over the long-term. The first is balance across the top and bottom line. I think you saw in the quarter that we just reported, it's a very balanced quarter in terms of strong growth on both. And to the extent that we can continue to deliver both, which we're committed to do the overall value creation result becomes much more sustainable. We've witnessed periods of time in our company and certainly within the industry and adjacent industries where the focus has disproportionately shifted, for example, to the bottom line. That is not a sustainable strategy in our view. And we've seen instances certainly in our own experience where focus has shifted disproportionately to the top line, which also is not a sustainable strategy in our view. So the balancing of the top and bottom line does lead to an expectation of more sustainable value creation delivery. The second piece is probably even more important and that is how we're thinking about sources of growth. And we're really trying as part of our superiority strategy to source growth through creation of business in the marketplace by driving market growth. That is a much more sustainable and generally more profitable way to drive our business. We're creating business not taking business from others. And when you are the driver of market growth, you will mathematically build share. So those two concepts are not incongruent. They're in complete congruence. And the question is how do you most sustainably and profitably build share? And we're now contributing to market growth at rates above our market share, which is exactly where we want to be, but that's important to the dynamics that I just described. It's also much more meaningful and relevant to our retail partners. They frankly could care less about P&G market share gains. What they care about is the overall market basket and the margins that they earn on that basket. So both of those focuses from a business model standpoint should conceptually increase the sustainability of our results. We'll have to demonstrate that in the marketplace. But certainly over the last five quarters if you look at the top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 7% doesn't guarantee anything in the future but it's been sustainable progress at least for a period of time. Relative to pricing, we -- I want to be careful on commenting on future pricing activities. What I would say is that to date, we feel good about the pricing that we've taken both as it relates to commodities and as it relates to foreign exchange and some of the developing markets. But that's something we look at on a category country basis every morning when we make up, and we'll adjust as we need to. Relative to the source of volume growth, I mentioned a significant portion of our growth is coming through creation of new business. There is as well and you're right to point out increase in distribution as you would expect given the demonstrated ability to grow markets for our retail partners. But those two things are not separable. And we've talked previously about the retail view of P&G, which has improved significantly, earning top consumer, products manufacturer at Walmart, really across the board and increasing \u2013 you saw the Advantage Monitor, survey where we're number one in our industry across all metrics that are measured and number one by a significant margin. We need to keep improving that. That's not any guarantee for success tomorrow but it is one of the reasons coupled with demonstrated ability to grow markets in many categories that we are increasing the level of distribution. And I don't see that as a step-function curve. I think it has room to continue to grow. Obviously to the extent that we demonstrate the same dynamic across more categories that's another driver of future growth. Thanks, Dara. You've certainly heard and not surprisingly competition talking about reinvesting in their businesses. I think that's driven by two things. One is the turnover of a generation of leadership in many of our competitive set. And two is the result situation that, we've been talking about together here this morning. We have not seen anything destructive in a mass aggregate scale in the market place from a competitive standpoint. We operate in very competitive industries so that doesn't change. But there hasn't been a step-function increase for example in the level of volume that's being sold on promotion. There has been increased initiative activity innovation driven. That's generally constructive for market growth. So we support that and we'll see. I do expect generally competition to increase as we continue going through the fiscal year. And remember, the time that exist between when you state an intent and when you can actually execute in the market is not short. It's relatively long, just given shelf set dynamics at retail, execution dynamics associated with for example innovation. So I wouldn't say that, we've seen everything that we're going to see. We're in a better position to deal with that than we've been in a long time given increasing percentage of our sales that are superior from a product package communication go-to-market standpoint. We still have work to do, which is why we're going to continue to invest and fund that through productivity. And that's our best defense. Laundry had a very strong quarter, up 8% driven by momentum really across the globe. We continue to advance the premium segment both laundry and fabric enhancers. Global value share was up about 0.5 point. Our growth on those premium segments, which include single-unit dose and scent beads, was high-teens and that's \u2013 that's really e-commerce sales up almost 50%. So, really what we're seeing there is innovation-driven, superiority-driven, market-growth-accretive growth, which to the point of the earlier question I expect would be sustainable at some level. And that's what I think about when I think about the laundry and fabric enhancer's category not a specific competitive dynamic. We continue to grow the paper businesses at very high levels in aggregate. And that segment, because of its \u2013 those segments because of their capital intensity are a little bit more responsive from a competitive dynamic standpoint to a variety of factors. But again, I would characterize the landscape as innovation-driven superiority-driven market-accretive growth. Think about \u2013 let's take one of those businesses Feminine Care as an example. Feminine Care in a quarter we grew 7% and that's composed of both strong growth on our base feminine protection business and high-teens level growth on our adult incontinence business. And we had an objective as we entered that category to source our growth through increased market growth. And we essentially doubled the rate of market growth for the adult incontinence category across the geographies where we've entered. So, again that is the predominance or the character of the landscape and the growth drivers as I see it. In terms of predicting any kind of consumer acceleration or consumer slowdown, we really \u2013 we aren't in that business. There are many things that can affect consumer confidence that are things we wouldn't even have the ability to anticipate today, certain geopolitical events, certain political developments within a country, et cetera. So your guess is as good as ours in terms of what market growth does going forward. We have seen no signs of weakness. We have seen continued sequential improvement on the margin. But that can change pretty quickly as we've all witnessed during our lifetimes. We are better positioned today for several reasons to deal with a downturn than we were for example in 2007, 2008. Number one, we are largely out of highly discretionary categories. This was part and parcel of our thinking as we moved to daily-use categories, categories that consumers are much less likely to go without on a daily basis. Generally, we don't see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession. To your point, they may trade down and I'll come to that in a second. But from a category standpoint and a portfolio composition standpoint, we are much better positioned than we were previously. That's number one. Number two, as we've been talking about throughout this call, we are much better positioned from a brand advantage standpoint. The products performing at noticeable levels of superiority in terms of meeting very important consumer needs and desires. And that is a major contributor to the overall value equation that consumers use as they assess their brand choice. There are two portfolio matters: So we've moved not only into daily-use categories but into categories where performance drives brand choice. And we're continuing to invest to build that advantage which is no guarantee but does increase the resilience of the portfolio to headwinds from a consumer standpoint. Third, we've worked to improve the pricing ladders, the availability of product at different price points, different pack sizes. That also is not a guarantee. But you put all of that together, again no guarantees but we're in a much better place. We will use tools like value messaging, like pack sizes, like performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we're as best positioned for consumers who are in a pinch. We want to be SKU efficient and have the right assortment at the shelf both in terms of serving the consumer and in terms of the right turnover for our retail partners. Nothing has really changed in that context. Relative to the trade inventory situation, I think we mentioned on the last call, a slight increase in inventories across the retail channel not consistently but in aggregate to support the things that you are describing as well as a commitment from a delivery standpoint to have product available for consumers on shorter and shorter notice, which requires higher inventories. In the quarter that we just \u2013 that \u2013 we saw that dynamic in the fourth quarter of last year. Those inventory levels have generally remained but we haven't seen any significant change. That's a big question, Olivia. I'll do my best. First, every category needs to be working to create additional sources of market growth within their \u2013 within the definitions of their existing category and in adjacencies relative to their existing category and that's going to be the predominant source of our growth. And whether that's a fabric enhancer, bead execution, whether that's a laundry single-unit dose execution both of which have significantly inflected market growth rates just as two examples. Some of the initiatives in our Beauty business are doing the same efforts in Power Oral Care as a way to grow markets really across the world. So that is a continuation of what we've been trying to do. And then we've added to that what we call PG Ventures, which is a innovation effort outside of existing categories and we brought products to market like Zevo, which is a natural insecticide. We're working across five or six pretty exciting opportunities that have come out of PG Ventures. That reports to Mary Lynn Ferguson. So it doesn't report into each and every category like she coordinates those efforts for us along with our outside venture partners. From a overall standpoint, whether it's internal innovation to drive superiority to drive market growth or innovation in P&G Ventures, we're operating much more through the lens of lean innovation which simplistically we could spend a day on that. But simplistically is designed to deliver faster, better learning, more shots on goal to increase the chance of breaking through and really having something meaningful to bring to market. Thanks, Kevin. The tracked number as you know was effectively 3% in the U.S. for the quarter. And as you cited, the overall number was about 6%. That delta is almost entirely due to faster growth rates in non-tracked channels. I mentioned global growth from a e-commerce standpoint at 30%. So customers like Amazon are growing at higher rates than some others. But also for example the club channel is growing at rates that are above the rate of market growth. There are not significant one-timers within the quarter in the U.S. The one significant one-timer that is in our aggregate results is the sell in ahead of the VAT increase, which went into effect on October 1 in Japan. That had about a 30 or 40 basis point impact on our numbers. We're always concerned about comps getting tougher, always working to run harder. That's a part of the world that we live in. Generally, it is not just for example SK-II and Olay which are growing at fantastic rates in China, but our growth profile across the categories has broadened significantly. You mentioned Baby Care. We were up high single-digits in Baby Care in the quarter very strong response to the innovation that we've brought to market. We are growing generally across the board. The one exception which has improved significantly is Hair Care. In Hair Care, we had very modest growth, but that's an improvement versus where we've been the last couple of quarters. So everything's on the rise in China. I feel -- we feel good about our prospects there. For perspective, if you look at China ex Olay and SK-II, we grew 9% in the quarter. So there is much more to the story than just those two businesses though we're very happy with the story on those two businesses. We have been seeing something similar. But frankly consumption in the month of September was very strong and we ended up with top line growth rates at very attractive level in Mexico for the last quarter at 10%. One thing that gives us confidence about continued success in Beauty are the sustainability of the results we've been delivering is the breadth of those results. And I think as I reflect on several of the conversations that we've had together there's a bit of a misunderstanding that it's all driven by SK-II and that just isn't the case. So we grew hair, our Hair Care business mid single-digits in the last quarter. We grew that business at 6% in the U.S. All aspects of our Skin and Personal Care business are growing. Our Personal Care business which is deodorants and body washes and those kinds of products grew at 10% in the quarter. Obviously, Skin Care and SK-II grew at even higher rates than that. If I looked just at SK-II it's one -- it's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio. Our new user attraction continues to be our focus. And as long as we keep that door open, we should continue to grow and that's been happening. But again breadth of success across Beauty. I'm not sure I know Nik exactly what the impact is going to be on those two subsets of businesses, small brands versus large brands directly as a result of what you just described. What I have felt for a long time, what we have felt for a long time and have been talking about for a long time is the relevance -- the continued relevance of large brands, as well as the relevance of small brands in certain instances across our ecosystem. Our large brands historically have grown about 4 points faster than our small brands. And when you look at the absolute growth that comes from that, it's significantly higher. But large -- every large brand started off as a small brand and so we can't ignore that dynamic either. As you know, we've been buying and building some smaller brands to serve some rapidly growing consumer segments particularly in the natural space, but not confined to that. I generally think -- we generally think that the ecosystem as we move forward at minimum does not disadvantage big brands. And I can make pretty strong arguments for why it should advantage big brands. When you think about e-commerce as the fastest growing channel in many -- well certainly in our two largest markets in the U.S. and China and the dynamic of big brands versus small brands in that environment. It disproportionately favors big brands, not at the exclusion of small brands by any means, but certainly doesn't disadvantage big brands. And I'd be happy to talk for hours about that, but I will spare the group that diatribe right here. But generally, we feel that both large brands and small brands will have relevance moving forward. There is nothing structurally or a from a society standpoint that disadvantages big brands particularly and this important when you focus your portfolio on categories where performance drives brand choice. There are very few consumers that sit in front of a physical or virtual shelf and how ask how large a brand is? They're wondering, how well it will to do the job they're buying it to do and will it meet their needs and solve their problems? Definitely, opportunities to return to growth, in fact, we've been growing albeit modestly. Each of the last two quarters we grew on a global basis. If you think about -- I mean, there are number of reasons to be positive going forward. One is, the growth potential that exists in developing markets and the mix potential that exists in those markets as people move up potentially from a double edge or disposables use into systems use. Strong opportunity to further penetrate, though, the double-edge and disposable businesses, particularly in some of the developing markets where for example a lot of the shaves are executed in the context of a barber. So significant opportunities for growth, we're also seeing a very strong response to our newest innovation which is designed to address one of the major barriers to shave and that's skin irritation. And for many men this is a significant issue. This isn't a minor issue. And it literally prevents them from shaving more frequently. So SkinGuard is designed to address that need and increase as a result the frequency of shave and the number of people who do shave. And we've doubled the rate of razor growth with that entry in Europe. If you look at consumer ratings on that product in the U.S., they're very strong. I think they're 4.5, 4.6. And the retailer reaction in terms of space allocation has been very favorable. There are also significant opportunities to address the needs of men who choose not to shave and that's where we're also spending a lot of incremental effort to make sure that we're meeting his needs. And if we do that in a superior way, for both shavers and non-shavers, this category will grow and it's extraordinarily profitable. The U.S. is front and center and that's generally across categories, with Grooming being an exception. Acquisition of -- or integration of the Merck business is going very well and a quick thank you to all those who are involved in that effort. We continue to grow that business at very attractive rates and continue to grow our heritage P&G Personal Healthcare business at very attractive rates. As you said, the total grew double digits in the quarter. If anything, if my knowledge is correct, it may not be, but if anything we saw, a slower buy in ahead of the season of this year as compared to, for example, last year, but certainly not a significant impact either way. Europe is definitely included in the characterization of all regions growing at 4% or more. Our big focus markets in Europe grew at 4% during the quarter. The more developing parts of Europe grew at 5% during the quarter. Really broad growth across countries within Europe: Germany, for example, up 6%; Russia up 5%; the combination of France and the U.K. up 2% to 3%. So we're seeing certainly growth ahead of the market in Europe. We built share -- our share position very nicely over the past 12, six, three and one-month period. So we're very happy with our performance there. I want to thank everybody. I know this is a busy morning with a number of companies reporting, so thank you for your time. John, Katie and I are available the balance of the day to answer any questions that you have to the best of our ability. Thanks a lot."

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that, during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor.\nDavid Taylor: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Last evening, we announced that I will retire as CEO on November 1 and John Moeller was elected as the incoming CEO. I will remain as Executive Chair of the Board. We also announced that Shailesh Jejurikar has been elected Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2021, transitioning behind John Moeller. These moves have been thoughtfully planed and provide P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward. I truly have full confidence and strongly support these changes. John, you know, well, he has a distinguished track record throughout his 33-year career with P&G, including more than 12 years as CFO. More recently, John added responsibilities as Vice-Chairman and then Chief Operating Officer with P&L responsibility and ownership for our enterprise markets. In my nearly six years as CEO, I've had the benefit of partnering with John and an outstanding global leadership team to integrate a comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. Now to go back, in 2012, John led the initial work to make productivity, an integral part of P&G\u2019s business. Our team doubled down on this strategy when we announced our second five-year $10 billion cost savings program in 2017. Today, productivity is built into our operating model and is an ongoing part of our strategy in every part of our business. We worked together for several years to focus the company's portfolio on faster growing, more profitable daily use categories, where product solve problems and performance drives consumer brand choice. The team largely completed this work with the divestiture of several fashion driven beauty categories in 2016. This strategy continues to guide our disciplined approach to managing our category and brand portfolio. At the CAGNY Conference in 2016, we first discussed the test we were doing on a new approach to our organization design. We refined and formalize the plans and announced the new focus market and enterprise market design at our November 2018 Analyst Day. Our objective was to create a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, which is exactly what we've done. In April, 2017, we first discussed our work to set a much higher bar for measuring the success of our innovation and execution across products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. If there were any doubts about the importance of consistently delivering irresistible superiority, our results over the last few years should have put those to bed. And finally, in 2018, we first talked about the need to lead constructive disruption in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. We continue to drive disruption in innovation, brand building, digitization, supply chain transformation, and with our citizenship and ESG efforts. Over several years through many challenges, our organization responded brilliantly as we integrated each element of the strategy, building momentum that is evident in our results in the past three fiscal years. The team fully embraced the idea that we must be willing to change anything and everything needed to win. The only things we will not change are our purpose, values, and principles in our commitment to winning. This has been especially evident during the continuing COVID crisis where the organization has demonstrated from ministry agility to meet the needs of consumers while ensuring the safety of our employees in supporting communities around the world to deal with the impacts of this crisis. Through all of it, delivering results, should delight owners and do it in a way that makes us proud to be P&G years. Put simply our strategies are working, our team is outstanding and I could not be more confident in the next-generation of leadership that will take the range of P&G later this year. Now let's turn it over to Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer, to lead us through the fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and yearend earnings announcement. Andre?\nAndre Schulten: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Joining David and me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of company results for fiscal 2021 and fourth quarter and David will add perspective on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2022. And then take your questions. Fiscal 2021 was another very strong year. Our focus on superiority and strong investment in the business, funded with strong productivity improvements and cost savings drove market growth, and it turns strong sales share earnings and cash results leading to balance growth and value creation. Organic sales for the fiscal year grew more than 6%, up more than 12% on a two-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with each our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Home Care up high teens, Oral Care up double digits, Skin and Personal Care up high single digits, Grooming, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Personal Health Care, organic sales each up mid-single digits, Family Care grew low singles, Baby Care was in line with prior year. We delivered strong results in our two largest and most profitable markets annualizing strong base periods. Organic sales were up 8% in the U.S. and 12% in greater China for the fiscal year. Focus markets grew 7% for the year. Enterprise markets were up 5% despite significant market growth impacts from the pandemic. E-commerce sales were up 35% for the year at over $10 billion in sales representing 14% of company total. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the fiscal year. All outlet value share in the U.S. improved through the year growing from 33% over the past 12 months, to 33.5% for the past six months, to 34% over the past quarter. One of the highest absolute value shares in the last 20 years. Consumers are increasingly choosing P&G brands. We translated the strong top-line growth into strong earnings and cash results. Core earnings per share grew 11% for the year. Currency neutral core EPS was also up 11%. Within this core gross margin expanded 20 basis points, up 60 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 80 basis points up 130 points, excluding currency impacts. Productivity improvements helped operating margin by 250 basis points, enabling strong \u2013 reinvestment in marketing programs. Advertising was a 10.8% of sales, an increase of more than 40 basis points. Adjusted free cashflow productivity was 107%. We increased our dividend by 10% and returned $19 billion of value to share owners, $8 billion in dividends and $11 billion in share repurchase. Moving on to the April, June quarter, organic sales grew 4%, volume, pricing and mix, each contributed more than one point to topline growth. Growth rates by market reflected the volatility and shipments and the base period. Organic sales were down 1% in the U.S. However, this is still 18% growth on a two-year stack. Recall that in the April, June quarter last year, organic sales were up 19% in the U.S. 13 points above track channel sales as we work to restock depleted trade inventories. Organic sales in greater China were up 5% also comping a strong base period, on a two-year stack, Greater China up 19%. Focus markets were up 2%, enterprise markets were up 14% in the quarter. Strong market share trends with aggregate global value share up 70 basis points. All the share in the U.S. increased 260 basis points for the quarter to 34.1%.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.13, down 3% versus prior year, down 4% on a currency neutral basis, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input cost as we had anticipated. Core gross margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core gross margin also down 260 points. This includes 220 basis points impact from higher commodity and freight costs, nearly 400 million in just this quarter. We also saw a sharp headwind from mix of 210 basis points, mainly geographic mix impacts. Recall that in our fourth quarter last year, the U.S. and China accounted for more than 100% of organic sales growth. In this year\u2019s fourth quarter Enterprise Markets lead the growth. Core operating margin decreased 230 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 210 basis points. Productivity improvements were 320 basis point helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was 117%. In summary, we exceeded each of our growth targets for the year. Organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free chase productivity, and cash returned to shareholders. Our team has operated with excellent discipline in a challenging and volatile environment. And with that, I'll pass it back to David.\nDavid Taylor: Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. In our April earnings call last year, we said we would step forward into the challenge of COVID not back. We said we would double down to serve consumers, and that's exactly what our team has done. As we continue to manage the crisis, we will remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And third priority supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices that I outlined earlier are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. I'd like share just a few examples. First in our Oral Care business, superior offerings to driving market growth across forms. Last summer, we launched Oral-B iO power brush, which offers an irresistible consumer brushing experience. The value of this superior performance is evident to the consumers, even with the premium price. P&G\u2019s global value share in the brush segment is up more than 2.5 points over the past year. And the U.S. power brush category is up nearly 14 points since the innovation launched, with IO contributing more than half of the category growth. We recently launched the next breakthrough in teeth whitening Crest Whitening Emulsions create a micro thin layer of concentrated peroxide droplets, enabling consumers to move beyond occasion-based whitening to a product that can be used up to four times per day with no rinsing or brushing needed. This innovation is a leading contributor to our more than 20% organic sales growth of our tooth whitening business in fiscal 2021. And it's driving two-thirds of the U.S. whitening category growth. In Personal Health Care, NyQuil and DayQuil Honey launched last summer, offering a great tasting formula, while also delivering powerful relief. NyQuil Honey is the number one new item in the U.S. respiratory market and our Vicks share is up 90 basis points over the past 12 months despite the soft market due to the very weak cough-cold season. When consumers are shopping in the category, they\u2019re increasingly choosing Vicks. For some consumers, the environmental aspects of our product offering are taking on increased importance in their assessment of superiority. We are offering a superior performing product or products that are more sustainable in educating consumers on the benefits of those products with superior brand communication. I\u2019ll switch to Fabric Care. Here, Tide and Ariel are innovating to extend their superior cleaning performance advantages, while encouraging consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. Ariels\u2019 new campaign Every Degree Makes a Difference advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry\u2019s carbon footprint comes from heating the water in the washing machine. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To achieve our goals, we continue to innovate to ensure superior fabric cleaning performance in cold water and we utilized superior communication to educate the consumer on the benefits. This innovation has helped contribute to global Fabric Care\u2019s 120 basis points of value share growth over the past 12 months. In our European Shave Care business, we\u2019re driving superiority across all five vectors and improving sustainability along the way. We\u2019re moving to a plastic-free packaging on our razor systems, simplifying our lineup, improving on shelf fundamentals and improving margin for our retail partners. This innovation contributed to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in our European Grooming business in fiscal 2021 with market share up one point; good business results and good for the environment. This packaging innovation will save the equivalent of 85 million water bottles per year when it\u2019s fully launched around the world. More important and one example is the common theme of superior innovation and execution that drives market growth. Leading category growth builds business for our retail partners and mathematically builds market share for P&G. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands and we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to contribute to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through the crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. In cost of goods, we\u2019re delivering flexible formulations that can allow us to change between ingredients to lower cost or create supply chain flexibility, while ensuring no impact on consumer preference for our brands. We\u2019re optimizing plastic bottle designs to reduce the amount of plastics we use, while also lowering costs. We\u2019re improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising investments, bringing some media planning work in-house to achieve greater cost efficiency, while also enabling us to place ads with greater precision based on more granular analytics to reduce waste and increase effectiveness. No area of cost is left untouched. We\u2019ve given more authority and accountability to the business units to decide how to balance the need for more resources in some areas of the business with the opportunities for savings in other areas. They need to make the choices that are best for their business as they work to deliver a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Our success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption; a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to meet new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grows share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during the crisis, and they will serve us well on the other end of this crisis. We\u2019re confident they remain the right strategic choices as we move through and beyond the pandemic. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2021 in a very challenging environment. While we\u2019re pleased with these results and the overall strength of our business, the external environment continues to be volatile and difficult to predict and our eyes are wide open to the many challenges we face. We compete in product categories against highly-capable multinational and local competitors. Raw material and transport freight costs have risen sharply. Increased social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world are putting pressure on local GDP growth and the pandemic continues to create risk for consumers, retail partners and supply chains. With these challenges, there are also opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. The relevance of our categories in consumers\u2019 lives likely remains elevated. We will serve what will likely become a forever-altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home; more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There is potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly-framed problems better than alternatives; potentially less experimentation; potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We\u2019re discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources; today\u2019s necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and in our office environment. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We have the right strategies, we have the right portfolio, we have the right organizational structure. We have a team of 100,000 employees focused on executing to delight consumers, win with customers and deliver balanced growth and value creation. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2022. Andre?\nAndre Schulten: As David said, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the crisis. Our quarterly results will be heavily influenced by top-line volatility embedded in base period results, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Input costs have risen sharply. Current spot prices for materials such as resins, chemicals and other ingredients are up anywhere from 30% to 200% versus April 2020. Most of the material cost increases occurred in this calendar year and will disproportionately affect the first half of fiscal 2022. Based on current spot prices, we estimate a $1.8 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Freight costs have also increased substantially due to several factors affecting the supply of drivers and the demand for drivers and trucks and diesel fuel prices are up 35% so far in the calendar. We currently expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $100 million after-tax headwind in fiscal 2022. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases, but there is a lag between the time when costs begin to rise and when pricing is implemented to provide an offset. As discussed last quarter, our Baby Care, Feminine Care and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced increases in the U.S. that will go into effect in mid-September. Earlier this year, we executed a significant product upgrade on our Japan liquid Ariel detergent, coupled with a 35% price increase. In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently announced that this price increase on Tide Simply, Cheer, and Era liquid detergents, effective in September. In U.S. Home Care, we\u2019ve announced double-digit price increases across all product forms of the Swiffer brand. These increases are effective mid-September. We have announced price increases in many Central Eastern European markets to offset a portion of recent currency impacts. In Latin America, we\u2019ve taken a cumulative high-single-digit price increase across our business over the past 12 months. We are analyzing input costs and foreign exchange rate impacts on other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. When opportunities allow, we will close couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. We believe this is a temporary bottom-line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business and not a reason to redesign a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Our guidance ranges for fiscal 2022 incorporate these dynamics. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The high end of this range assumes global markets continue growing at about 3% or so and P&G continues to grow above market level. The low end of this range assumes deterioration in global markets to 2% or lower with P&G growth at or above underlying markets. This range also reflects the strong organic sales growth, more than 8%, that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021. Given this base period dynamic, we expect organic sales growth to be stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022 versus the front half. On the bottom-line, we expect core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%. This outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.9 billion from \u2013 after-tax from commodity cost of freight, as I mentioned earlier, with a modest offset, overall, of $100 million after-tax from foreign exchange rate benefits. The combined impact of materials, freight and FX is approximately a $0.70 per share headwind to EPS or a 12%-point headwind to EPS growth in fiscal 2022. Considering the costs challenge is weighted heavily towards the front half of the year. Our earnings growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% starting the year. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase between $7 billion and $9 billion of common stock; combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now back to David for closing comments.\nDavid Taylor: Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow through and beyond the crisis. We will manage what is likely to be a volatile near term, consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exists in many parts of the world. We\u2019ll continue to step forward toward our opportunities, not back. We remain committed to our strategies and fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund investment and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth over the long term. We\u2019re doing this in our interest, in society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about marketing both in terms of the efficiencies you've been realizing over the last several years and sort of thought process on the amount of spending necessary kind of going forward. So, and also relevant to the succession plans announced last night. So, you've delivered $2 billion in media spending efficiencies over five years, right? And then marketing reinvestment this quarter was way stronger than we had expected. I think it was up 170 basis points on top of a 270-basis point investment last year. So, one, how much has really left to go for on that efficiency side of the equation? Two, as you think about incremental reinvestment, there's so much funding in the base from the past two years. How are you thinking about that for fiscal 2022? And then finally, I've been asked a few times over email, just CFO becoming a CEO, should the marketers be worried? I'd love to hear everyone's perspective. Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: Okay. Let me start with the last part first. And then Andre can hit some of that the marketing spending numbers. But first, no, the marketer should not be worried. The marketer should feel wonderful, and that we've got a senior leadership that is maintaining a high degree of consistency. And you all know Jon very, very well. He has supported these investments in media, to the extent they grow the market and grow market share and are helping drive awareness and trial of superior products and brands. That's a good thing. It's about creating value, not reducing or increasing one element of cost. And Jon has been very engaged with me and the leadership team in these decisions. The other thing about our organization structure, we leave it to the sector CEOs and the enterprise leader to decide how much to invest in their businesses. This is not a decision we make at the headquarters. It's a decision made by each one of the business leaders and we hold them accountable to create the top and bottom-line growth and cash generation for their business. And I think the results the last three years speaks in themselves. And so, they actually should feel very good as do I, that the leadership of the company and the organization structures working very well. And one comment on the marketing spending efficiency, then Andre can add some additional comment. We have increased meaningfully the investment in marketing. But we have also increased the rate of meaningful innovation that grows the market. So, one of the key parts is you have to help consumers understand what the product is, how to use it, and then help drive awareness and trial. And these investments have done that. It's evidenced and again, in the top line growth, you recall very well. If you go back four or five years ago, our average growth was about 2%. We moved up to the past four years. Past five years, we've averaged 4%. In the last three years 6%.  And we've got the strongest share growth we've seen in many years, which tells me the combination of the superiority strategy and the brand execution by our people is really working. And we'll continue to invest behind both brands that are winning and invest to make sure we get the trial. And Andre, any comments on the specific numbers?\nAndre Schulten: Look, I think we've increased our ad spending year-over-year in fiscal 2021 versus 2020 by $850 million. And as David said, superior communication is a core element of our superiority framework and we've not reached the point of diminishing return on those investments. So, we'll continue to invest at around that level in percent of sales. We also do believe that there is significant productivity improvements still within the media spend. When you think about shift into digital media improved targeting capability with first party audiences or third-party audiences and ability to sharpen our focus, even on TV audiences with our own data. So there continues to be a significant leverage in terms of direct media spend efficiencies that we can create to improve quantity of reach and quality of reach. In the indirect space, we also striving to continue to improve production costs agency structures. So you'll see us continue to work in that direction mostly to reinvest in superiority and superior communication.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks. And good morning. And congrats to you both this morning Jon and David. It feels like the businesses being passed off with great momentum. So again, congrats to you both. I guess my question, I think, it's probably a question for Andre mostly. Andre, I think you said that China was up 5% in the quarter. I don't know if you provided a U.S. growth rate in the quarter. But if you have one that would be great. And I'm thinking the question really is that, as you said, both those businesses had very difficult comps in the year-ago quarter. Those difficult comparisons continue in the first half of 2022. So just in terms of the makeup of growth first half, second, half geographically is there anything to call out there? Do you feel like the U.S. can stay positive in the first half? Does anything to call it in terms of the context of growth via geography? Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: Yes, very good. So, U.S. quarter four growth was a minus 1%. If you look on the two-year stack basis, that's 18%. Last year's quarter four was 19% growth and the strong growth in last year's quarter was mainly driven about 13 points, I believe by restocking retail inventories after strong consumption. So, in comparison, minus one on a 19% base. The U.S. consumption I think we believe at this point in time, we'll return to normal levels. Most importantly, we see our shares at record levels in the U.S. Our brands are continuing to strive. We're gaining share across categories. Our retail partnerships are strong and we have very strong innovation programs hitting in the U.S. So, we remain confident, but I think you're rightfully cautious in terms of base period effects, especially in the first half. On the China side, we expect the market to continue to grow mid singles. Our mantra is to grow ahead of that. And I would tell you the same thing I told you for the U.S. We feel good about the strength of our brands. In China, we feel good about our go-to-market capabilities, and we'll continue to invest in innovation and supporting those innovations in the market. Same comment considering base period is going to be prudent for China and the entire focus markets environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. So just taking a step back now that we've got a full quarter in the books where you've cycled a period where COVID was unfortunately with us, and the leadership change going forward. I was just hoping you could review maybe some of the more enduring consumer changes that you see post-COVID, again from a consumer perspective and how you think P&G is positioned relative to those changes. And then, regarding the CEO change down the road, any sort of tweaks in strategy here or areas of just increased emphasis either in that post-COVID environment or with the change in leadership. Thanks.\nDavid Taylor: A couple of comments about the consumer changes that we think are endearing, and then certainly Andre and Jon can jump in with some comments as well. We do believe that the health cleaning and hygiene brands will continue to play an increased role. There's some statistics that I saw a while back that pre-pandemic about 5% of people work from home, and then post-pandemic estimated 20. I don't know what the number will be, but certainly there's a significant number of people that will be in home more than they were pre-pandemic. That bodes well for us. I believe the strength of our brands and actually the shift toward trusted brands will likely last a good while we've had meaningful, increased household penetration on some of our brands as there was a stock-up and then people got exposed to the superior performance. I think that will have a lingering, positive impact. So, you've got both more people at home, not take the U.S. especially, more occasions at home. You've got a shift toward trusted brands and the role that health plan and hygiene place will anniversary some tough comps, but the health of the brands and the share of momentum. And to me, it gives me a lot of confidence going forward. The U.S. and Europe, I call it our biggest focus markets are having some of the strongest share progress they've had in every one of those categories. And absolute share is higher than they were pre-pandemic with the exception of family care that had a supply issue for the first part and just couldn't supply because the increased demand and their growing share in the fourth quarter. So, we've got good momentum, consumers continue to vote for trusted superior performing brands. And that I think those consumer habit changes will likely last.\nAndre Schulten: What I'd say, maybe I think our portfolio positions us well. There were many categories that did not benefit from COVID tailwinds in our portfolio. When you think about adult incontinence, deodorants, shave care, some of the tooth whitening that we see coming back, Personal Health Care had a very low cough-cold season with everyone wearing masks and our professional business certainly that serves hotels and restaurants did not do well. So as mobility increases, those businesses pick up and we see that as a positive going forward obviously. Geographically, many of the markets we operate in specifically the enterprise markets never did see a benefit in terms of consumption from COVID as consumers and retailers were impacted by the crisis. So hopefully as these markets work through the pandemic, that will also provide a tailwind from a geographic standpoint.\nJon Moeller: And relative to the question on strategic changes as we go forward, we will always be responsive to consumers and customers whose needs will continue to evolve over time. I don't foresee that leading to any major change in the strategies that the team has been executing with excellence. But again, we will continue to be very attentive to and responsive to consumer and customer needs.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. My first question, actually, David, sort of before you go. One of the categories that seems to sort of be, I don't want to say persistently weak, but kind of lagging in terms of sustained global market share improvements is baby care. And I know the last 12 months has been really funny. You've actually had some market share recovery, because they were depressed last year, given supply issues, but still just sort of in totality, Baby Care just looks to be such a competitive marketplace. I think Kimberly sounded more aggressive and more optimistic about their market share positions. You've obviously got lots of fragmentation in the category with more organic, all natural players, sort of trying to gain traction. So, can you kind of give us a state of the union on Baby Care in particular where you think Proctor is? Why you think there it's been sort of a stubborn business for you in terms of being able to really make progress, especially in China? That would be great. Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: Sure. Happy to. First, it has been a challenging category for several years. And as we were very open several years ago, it would take time because the technical changes we need to make to deliver product superiority. And we continue to make those changes, but I'm actually very encouraged by the progress they've made. Our focus markets grew top line and profits last year. All-in profits increased global Baby Care made progress. Our North America business especially was plus 3%. The highest has been in six years. We're leading the category growth. We actually have strong share growth now in North America, most recent period, it's up a point or more. Our superiority metric, which is really important, back several years ago, it was 25%, which is unacceptable. It's up to 60% rising and we'll continue to be investing to again, delight consumers. But with North America doing better. Europe returned to growth for the first time in six years. You're right. It's been challenging, both the birth rate, but returned to growth, expanded the margins, we addressed some of the challenges we had in our enterprise markets. Jon and his team did a great job there working to make sure we had structurally profitable businesses and adjusting the business model and supply systems where need be. So, you look across those. And then this shift toward fast growth segments. Our wipes business was up 10%. Our pants business was up 12%. We doubled our bed wetter segment growth to 12% behind the successful Ninjamas launched. So, there's a number of things going well. We still have much work to do. And we understand that. Baby Care does take time, but this was the best year we've had in six years and the trends are positive. We're now playing in fast-growing segments and the product superiority is getting better each year. So, I become more optimistic on Baby Care each year. I think the leader and their team are doing a really nice job recognizing that this is a mid to long-term game and they're continuing to make the right investments.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI.\nJavier Escalante: Hi, good morning, everyone. And congratulations to David and Jon from Robert and I well deserved. My question has to do with your plan to offset the increases in raw material the $1.9 billion hit. And if you could just split the pricing versus savings, how much you're going to need in terms of not taking pricing. How much is pricing and if you could help us understand what is happening geographically. We have a good feel of the U.S. We do not about Western Europe in particular and both two of their competitors, Colgate and Unilever reported negative pricing in Western Europe which is surprising. And I think that they were even talk about the inflation. So, if you can talk about pricing in general and what's leading this deflation, is the consumer, is the retailer, is competitive dynamic? Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: I'll give one quick comment and turn it to Andre. Javier, we have many tools to deal with the commodity cost increase. And one thing that is very clear is that hits everybody. That hits local brands, international brands equally in many ways more severely if you don't have scaled supply systems and the buying power that a company like P&G dash, where we work collaboratively with our suppliers. So, we've got the tools that include innovation, which I think is the strongest I've seen it in years. We have certainly pricing, but we have a very active productivity program. So, we've got the tools. If you get into specifics for Europe and others, I'm going to turn it to Andre to get into. But again, I think we're well positioned to deal with it, and we have our eyes wide open that it's going to be meaningful. And especially in some of the categories that have some of the increased amounts of raw materials that have been hit the most. Andre, you want to give any specific comments about Europe?\nAndre Schulten: What I would say is similar to what David mentioned, I think productivity is going to be a core driver of the offsets that we will continue to focus on. The commodity pressures that we're seeing as you have heard broad based in the industry and therefore the same pressures exist in the market around the world. In terms of pricing, we've mentioned that we've taken and announced pricing in Central and Eastern European markets. We've announced pricing in the U.S., which you referenced, and we've also have taken pricing and cumulatively high single digits in Latin America over the past 12 months. We will continue to evaluate pricing opportunities around the world. And we are encouraged, I think by our ability to execute pricing in the markets where we have announced. But I cannot comment on any additional pricing that we might or might not take again, that is within the discretion of the sector leaders. And we'll come out as we see fit.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations to David and Jon. Broader portfolio question, just to kind of pull back a little bit. So really beyond fiscal 2022, and it relates specifically around strategic priorities and where you see the greatest opportunities to accelerate profitable growth. So, Jon understanding your comments that the strategies indeed working. This is just going to be sort of a continuation and execution against that. And David, you talked about what the company has done with respect to productivity structure, culture innovation. And I think, there's sort of general recognition among the investment community. You look at the market share momentum and the results. It is a strategy that's clearly working, but that being said, as you look across your geographies, your categories and your cost structure, I would like to get your perspective on the areas where you see the greatest opportunity to accelerate growth and maximize profitability. And Jon, how you intend to prioritize those? Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: Yes, I'll give comment now and I'll turn it to Jon. First, there are many opportunities, but it starts right here in the U.S. It's our largest market. We have \u2013 we declared several years ago, the U.S. is a growth market. We don't have any markets that aren't growth markets. It's our job to create the innovation that drives the growth. And I think it's best illustrated by the U.S. We are averaging 1% to 2% and we've moved to mid singles. And certainly, the last two years, we've been in high singles and it has driven by the innovation and the communication, just the superiority strategy being brought to health and executed in a very good way. We have had some bolt-on acquisitions that you're well aware of. There've been some categories that we've been open about. We added the Merck international business to our health care, and that's done very well. And you've seen the growth recently in our healthcare business. That remains an interesting segment. You've seen some bolt-on acquisitions in the beauty care business. Again, that remains an interesting business as well. And each of the sector leaders has the opportunity to evaluate whether they see bolt-on acquisitions or acquisitions that would be helpful. The core though is most important, driving the core and the focus markets, and then continuing to have smart growth and value creations in the enterprise markets is working. And I believe that's the right strategy. I'll turn it to Jon to offer any comments about how he's thinking about the future. But we've worked together on these and been aligned that it starts with delivering the core and seeing market growth is a key responsibility of each category.\nJon Moeller: Kevin, I really like, when you've heard me talk about this before each of the categories that we've decided to play in, as we've focused on strengthened our portfolio. And I firmly believe that they all have opportunity to grow and to create value. And you're seeing that, and the results that Andre described, for example, there's very broad progress that's occurring across those businesses. Similarly, from a geographic standpoint, what people would view as mature markets have significant growth potential that exists within them. You've seen the results in the U.S. If you look at category development outside of the U.S., on average is 20% of U.S. levels. So, there's significant opportunity across geographies to continue to develop these categories to grow markets and increased consumption. And historically, while we probably felt that way for the focus markets, we were a little bit concerned about what kind of future the enterprise markets held for us. But the team there has made significant progress in the last couple of years in dramatically increasing the structural profitability of those businesses. So, they are investment grade, and we can take advantage of the population on income growth that will occur in those markets and do so in a very profitable value accretive way. We exited last year with one country well over 100 countries and the enterprise markets losing any money. So, the majority are contributing positively to the company's topline and bottom line. So, I don't want to in any way backhand the question. But I really do believe that we have opportunities for growth and value creation in each of our categories and broadly across the global geography. And then it becomes executing the strategy that we've all talked about a number of times, and that as Andre mentioned, we will continue to double down on stepping forward, not back.\nOperator: Your next question will be from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks. And morning everybody. Wanted to ask about thoughts on sustainability of EBIT margin expansion that we've seen in recent years. I get the comments about the roughly three points or so if my math is right of input commodity cost headwinds for 2022. So, I guess, broader picture 2021 sounds like you are saying that's a base. You think you can obviously expand over time in a normalized world. I guess, maybe you could just talk a bit about how holistically you are thinking about that. And then maybe drilling in a little bit as well, looking at segments most of the \u2013 where the strongest rate of expansion has come from household products, whether it's a household care, or a fabric or baby, et cetera. So how sustainable is that? What can you do there to further improve? And just, as I said, broadly, kind of, how are you thinking about margins? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: So, I think, as David explained and Jon explained we are very pleased with the categories we\u2019re operating in. I think they all offer continued growth opportunity. If you think about either growing the market via innovation with the examples that David mentioned earlier, if you think about trading consumers up into premium propositions will have superior profitability in terms of penny profit for us. If you, for example, liquid fabric enhancers, household penetration in the U.S. is only 37% and only 52% of those households use fabric enhancer with every load. So, there's tons of runway. When you think about beats [ph], those numbers are even lower. Those propositions accretive to all portfolio, are accretive to all margins and we\u2019ll continue to focus on those. And they provide a good source for future growth, both top and bottom line. Productivity is another key lever that still has enormous runway across the balance sheet and across the P&L. Our supply chain continues to have significant opportunity in terms of synchronization. But also, every innovation that we bring basically creates a new cost S curve that we can then optimize from. We talked about media and advertising spend as a significant source of future profitability, growth and productivity. And I would add, go-to-market specifically in terms of go-to-market logistics, but also go-to-market spend as a source So, we feel confident in our ability to deliver, even with cost headwinds, which is reflected in our guidance for next year. And we do believe there's enough leavers in the portfolio from trade up, to usage expansion, to be able to continue to do so.\nDavid Taylor: Some of you have heard me talk about this before, but there is a chart that I share with our leadership team whenever we're together. That highlights the importance of growth on both the topline and margin, and delivering top third, total shareholder return. We need to do both to dependably deliver a top third shareholder return over reasonable periods of time. So that will continue to be the focus and the emphasis. Having said that, margin as a metric, has many issues associated with it. The first being, I can't put margin in a bank, I can't return margin to share owners. What matters most is what Andre referred to, which is penny profit and overall profit and profitability. And we've got to make sure that we keep our eyes firmly on that as we work to grow the topline.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning. And congrats to all of you in particular, David. And thanks for your leadership. And congrats to Jon and Chevalier. I have a question on the Beauty and follow-up on Baby Care. What are you expecting for fiscal 2022 in terms of recovering skincare in Japan and China for both SK-II and Olay? And for baby, David, your comments of improvement most recently, are you putting a question now for John more money behind innovation this fall here's to because Pampers Pure was a good launch but it seems that core Pampers is still lagging? And a clarification on the $1.9 billion headwind for fiscal 2022, are you embedding that commodities and transportation costs will be stabilize, or decline, or have you conservatively assumed that these cost pressures will linger at ground levels, given understandably wide EPS range that you gave?\nDavid Taylor: Let me start with a couple of those. There are quite a few questions there. So, you have to help me if we don't answer each one. First, you mentioned a Beauty business and specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased if I just take SK-II as an example, you would have expected it to get hit very, very hard because of travel retail, virtually stopping in Asia. And it's certainly a huge channel. But the team pivoted amazingly well and was able to actually grow the business last year, the business was up double digits up 13%. So, SK-II is actually healthy and continues to run nicely because the consumption that did not happen in travel retail happened in the home market. And then there was the duty-free area in Heinemann province, they did a really nice job, making sure that the brand was both available and had the innovation and communication to win. So, SK-II is healthy, and I expect \u2013 I don't know when travel retail will resume, you can take your guess, it looks like it's going to be a while. But the good news is at the strong growth that we're seeing already, we're not dependent on that. It could be a help if and when it opens up anytime soon. More broadly the Skin and Personal Care business had a strong year last year as to the overall beauty business. So, again I feel very good about the business. How strong it grows next year will be dependent again on many of the factors that we've already mentioned. While there's meaningful cost headwinds, the innovation that both Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care has launched and will be launching I feel very good about. So, both businesses had strong years on the top and bottom line, and I feel good about those. Baby Care, I made a number of comments earlier, so I'm not sure what else would be helpful. Yes, we are very committed to the category. The innovation coming, and will continue to come. We are on the multi-year innovation program. Certainly, part of it has hit the market and you see that improvement in percent superiority from 25% to 60%. We will continue to work to move that up significantly. And we also recognize that for many consumers in the mini markets, the premiumization is critically important in these high growth areas. And that allows us to offset some of the challenges that you're well aware of on the birthright. And still grow the category, and grow share, and create value. And Baby Care did create value this year. It's a very strong year, strong improvement. So, all these businesses to me have meaningful upside. And especially the Beauty business has very good momentum and Baby Care is accelerating. So, I feel good about both.\nJon Moeller: And Andrea, to answer your question on the commodity exposure and freight exposure, we are forecasting a spot. So, we assume spot prices will sustain throughout the year. So, we don't expect an easing of these commodity pressures within the guidance that we've given.\nOperator: Okay. Next question will be from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. So just two specific questions. I'll keep it brief. So, just on Grooming, volume is up for the first time in a while on a fiscal year, pricing as well. Have we turned the corner in the business? I'm also conscious there could be some cyclical recovery with return to office. Any perspective on just where you think the business sits on this recovery curve, and if that's by geography or priced here? Any perspective would be helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on SK-II, I noticed that in the press release talks about in pricing premiumization, but not volume. Is it safe to assume, it's been more driven by price of late and not volume? So, any clarification there would be helpful? Thanks so much.\nDavid Taylor: It's actually very balanced volume and pricing. But let me take one and then we can give the specific numbers. First, on Grooming, Grooming had a very strong year. They grew mid-single digits on the top and double digit on the bottom. Importantly, they grew share almost every segment across whether it was male shaved, female shave, appliance, all of those making very good progress, which contributed to the strong growth. And as you rightfully said, as people return to working outside the home, I think that will benefit the category. And what the team has done, which I think is very strong and very important going for the future, we're no longer a wet shave business. We're truly a Grooming business, with growth in wet shave, dry shave, which we call appliances. We're also growing in many of the new areas, like IPL, the intense pulsed light area, all of those to me, give me confidence and these new segments as well. We have innovation come on King C. Gillette, which helps people with facial hair. So, it's a broader portfolio, innovation across all those different forms and segments. And it's leading to mid singles top and double-digit bottom. So that's the strongest year we've had in many, many years in Grooming. And the reason is strong, should continue because it's innovation-driven, consumer-driven.\nJon Moeller: And on SK-II, what David said is certainly right. Growth is very strong 13% as David mentioned for the fiscal year, but 35% for quarter four. The pricing taken was mid-single. So, by far there is a significant volume component to it as the team shifted consumption into high non, which is a big part of the offset to travel retail reduction. So again, growth on SK-II is both volume and price mix driven.\nOperator: Your next question will be from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning, everyone. And David and John, I want to offer my congratulations as well. So, I guess I just wanted to ask about the business momentum and growth from here. And I mean the quarterly performance, and what we can see in the data is very impressive. So, congrats on that. And I know the health of the brand is very strong. But when you think about the magnitude of growth versus your peers, I mean, do you expect this level of out-performance to continue? I mean you mentioned record share like how much more room do you have on the share side, because a lot of your competitors are really implementing a similar playbook in attempting to innovate with superiority as well? So just like any comments on the relative out-performance from here would be really helpful. Thanks.\nDavid Taylor: I won't speculate too much on the relative out performance. What I can say is the strength of just what you said, the brands are strong and the measures we use, which I think are really important, our superiority metrics are relative to the best competitor in each brand, in each country. So, it pushes us to maintain and try to extend the advantage we have. Now we have full respect for our competitors. And you're right we have very strong growth in both North America, Europe, and Latin America. And in those markets that we'll see what happens next year. But if this share of growth has been now sustained in North America for three years and in Europe for three years. So, the focus markets are performing very well. And as John mentioned, we have very strong progress in the enterprise markets. We are mid singles with double digit growth in a very, very difficult environment. So that gives me confidence. We're at least well positioned. But the other thing is very real, you have to earn it every day. And so, our teams understand that our competitors are refocusing and those that lost share will come back with their innovations and investments. And it's our job to go earn it. But it's very clear that's what they're accountable to deliver. And based on the last three years, I've got confidence that we\u2019ll continue.\nJon Moeller: And just a reminder, excuse me. How you gain, share how we gained, share is very important in the answer to this question. And Dave has talked many times in our discussion this morning as is Andre about our intent to be a disproportionate driver of market growth. The math that falls out of that create share growth. But the notion that we're taking business from competitors, and it's only a matter of time and that that's not how we look at things. Our job is to be constantly expanding the pie, constantly expanding the number of households that we serve. And if we do that well, there's no reason that growth shouldn't be sustainable.\nOperator: All right, we\u2019ll next, go to Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. I'm not one who typically says congratulations on these types of calls. But I just want to take a step David the retirement couldn't be more deserved. Looking back six years ago in terms of where the company was, and especially where investor sentiment was, it's been remarkable that where we are today. And knowing you for decade plus and how integral you've been in kind of the turnaround. I mean, you are, I think most people would agree on the call, Mr. P&G. So, so well-deserved. And I applaud the Board and everyone for making these changes, because I think it's just well done. So, with that moving on to the actual question, kind of on trade promotion, as we look back with pandemics trade promotion dropped off, it's not coming back kind of to full extent as you would expect as you are taking pricing and what have you. And just kind of want to understand if you think this is kind of a permanent change, if we've kind of made a shift back to where marketing and innovation really take the lead in terms of investment dollars and trade promotion never really kind of goes back to where it was pre-pandemic levels, or if you do see it starting to creep back into pre-pandemic levels. Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: So, I just offer a couple of thoughts. First, thank you for the kind words. The organization deserves a ton of credit and the total leadership team. But I appreciate your comments on me and very much agreeing to comments on John. In terms of trade promotion, certainly it's in our best interest to bring to our retail partners programs that build their business and build their margin. I do believe, as you said, that that can best be done by innovation and market growing plans. And there's walls they play with us and making sort of things like the shelf, but a virtual or physical shelf is arranged in a way that creates market growth and helps consumers find the brands that they're most apt to use. We worked with retail partners around the world. And the ones we've partnered with best success is they grow the market, grows, the margin grows and that we helped them do it, we get rewarded. So, we will continue with that certainly objective. Certainly, our eyes are wide open. I expect from a very low base, we will see an increase in trade spending. Do I believe it to go all the way back to what it was before? I think many retailers are very interested in finding smart ways and they have the same pressures that we do with the commodity costs, they need as well as we to find ways to create value. So, I'm hopeful that we'll see some thoughtful change in promotion strategy that is more value creating for the market.\nJon Moeller: Yes. And then to add a few numbers to David's statements quarter four in the U.S. we saw trade promotions, volumes sold on deals back to 27%, which was in line with quarter three, but it's still below pre-pandemic levels, which was around 33%. So, we're certainly getting back to a more normalized level in quarter four.\nOperator: All right. And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much. And let me add my congratulations, David, Jon known better. A quick one, and then a little bit more involved one please. The quick one, does the point guidance you gave us on cost headwinds and ForEx benefits, does that include hedging current or anticipated? And then the second, maybe a little more in follow-up one is we've had a lot of discussions with consumer staples leaders in the past really two weeks about the state of retailer inventory. And that's largely a U.S. question, but it seems all over the Board, a lot of retailers are seeing better foot traffic, certain retailers, certain channels have had unprecedented volume that's stuck around. And there is a little bit of a mentality of maybe taking on more inventory and shipping, maybe not matching up with measured takeaway, not only in the U.S. but other places. And I think it cuts both ways. So, I know there's a lot to that question, but anything you could say about retailer inventories, where you think that is, and you have to say your big markets, say your focused markets where you stand and how that plays into your guidance for 2022? What are your thoughts about that, how that plays in? I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nDavid Taylor: So, I'll let Andre comments on the hedging question just a second. The way I think about the retailers\u2019 approach to their business, I don't really think about it through an inventory lens so much as I think about it through a desire to maintain dependability of supply. And those manufacturers that can offer that assurance are often being rewarded with increased shelf space and increased focus on the part of our retail partners. There's a small amount of inventory bill, but that's not really the focus. The focus is on how do we ensure supply and maintain the satisfaction of our shoppers. And that's a very fertile place for us to apply. With regard to hedging Andre.\nAndre Schulten: So, yes, the short answers that $1.9 billion that we've communicated is the net impact to P&G.\nJohn Chevalier: Good, thank you very much. I think that concludes the call. We very much appreciate your engagement. P&G has got strong momentum. We've got a strong leadership, leadership team and organization, and we will continue to work aggressively to deliver strong results and value for our shareholders. Thank you all for your support and your comments today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Taylor",
            "content": "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Last evening, we announced that I will retire as CEO on November 1 and John Moeller was elected as the incoming CEO. I will remain as Executive Chair of the Board. We also announced that Shailesh Jejurikar has been elected Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2021, transitioning behind John Moeller. These moves have been thoughtfully planed and provide P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward. I truly have full confidence and strongly support these changes. John, you know, well, he has a distinguished track record throughout his 33-year career with P&G, including more than 12 years as CFO. More recently, John added responsibilities as Vice-Chairman and then Chief Operating Officer with P&L responsibility and ownership for our enterprise markets. In my nearly six years as CEO, I've had the benefit of partnering with John and an outstanding global leadership team to integrate a comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. Now to go back, in 2012, John led the initial work to make productivity, an integral part of P&G's business. Our team doubled down on this strategy when we announced our second five-year $10 billion cost savings program in 2017. Today, productivity is built into our operating model and is an ongoing part of our strategy in every part of our business. We worked together for several years to focus the company's portfolio on faster growing, more profitable daily use categories, where product solve problems and performance drives consumer brand choice. The team largely completed this work with the divestiture of several fashion driven beauty categories in 2016. This strategy continues to guide our disciplined approach to managing our category and brand portfolio. At the CAGNY Conference in 2016, we first discussed the test we were doing on a new approach to our organization design. We refined and formalize the plans and announced the new focus market and enterprise market design at our November 2018 Analyst Day. Our objective was to create a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, which is exactly what we've done. In April, 2017, we first discussed our work to set a much higher bar for measuring the success of our innovation and execution across products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. If there were any doubts about the importance of consistently delivering irresistible superiority, our results over the last few years should have put those to bed. And finally, in 2018, we first talked about the need to lead constructive disruption in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. We continue to drive disruption in innovation, brand building, digitization, supply chain transformation, and with our citizenship and ESG efforts. Over several years through many challenges, our organization responded brilliantly as we integrated each element of the strategy, building momentum that is evident in our results in the past three fiscal years. The team fully embraced the idea that we must be willing to change anything and everything needed to win. The only things we will not change are our purpose, values, and principles in our commitment to winning. This has been especially evident during the continuing COVID crisis where the organization has demonstrated from ministry agility to meet the needs of consumers while ensuring the safety of our employees in supporting communities around the world to deal with the impacts of this crisis. Through all of it, delivering results, should delight owners and do it in a way that makes us proud to be P&G years. Put simply our strategies are working, our team is outstanding and I could not be more confident in the next-generation of leadership that will take the range of P&G later this year. Now let's turn it over to Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer, to lead us through the fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and yearend earnings announcement. Andre? Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. In our April earnings call last year, we said we would step forward into the challenge of COVID not back. We said we would double down to serve consumers, and that's exactly what our team has done. As we continue to manage the crisis, we will remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And third priority supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices that I outlined earlier are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. I'd like share just a few examples. First in our Oral Care business, superior offerings to driving market growth across forms. Last summer, we launched Oral-B iO power brush, which offers an irresistible consumer brushing experience. The value of this superior performance is evident to the consumers, even with the premium price. P&G's global value share in the brush segment is up more than 2.5 points over the past year. And the U.S. power brush category is up nearly 14 points since the innovation launched, with IO contributing more than half of the category growth. We recently launched the next breakthrough in teeth whitening Crest Whitening Emulsions create a micro thin layer of concentrated peroxide droplets, enabling consumers to move beyond occasion-based whitening to a product that can be used up to four times per day with no rinsing or brushing needed. This innovation is a leading contributor to our more than 20% organic sales growth of our tooth whitening business in fiscal 2021. And it's driving two-thirds of the U.S. whitening category growth. In Personal Health Care, NyQuil and DayQuil Honey launched last summer, offering a great tasting formula, while also delivering powerful relief. NyQuil Honey is the number one new item in the U.S. respiratory market and our Vicks share is up 90 basis points over the past 12 months despite the soft market due to the very weak cough-cold season. When consumers are shopping in the category, they're increasingly choosing Vicks. For some consumers, the environmental aspects of our product offering are taking on increased importance in their assessment of superiority. We are offering a superior performing product or products that are more sustainable in educating consumers on the benefits of those products with superior brand communication. I'll switch to Fabric Care. Here, Tide and Ariel are innovating to extend their superior cleaning performance advantages, while encouraging consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. Ariels' new campaign Every Degree Makes a Difference advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in the washing machine. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To achieve our goals, we continue to innovate to ensure superior fabric cleaning performance in cold water and we utilized superior communication to educate the consumer on the benefits. This innovation has helped contribute to global Fabric Care's 120 basis points of value share growth over the past 12 months. In our European Shave Care business, we're driving superiority across all five vectors and improving sustainability along the way. We're moving to a plastic-free packaging on our razor systems, simplifying our lineup, improving on shelf fundamentals and improving margin for our retail partners. This innovation contributed to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in our European Grooming business in fiscal 2021 with market share up one point; good business results and good for the environment. This packaging innovation will save the equivalent of 85 million water bottles per year when it's fully launched around the world. More important and one example is the common theme of superior innovation and execution that drives market growth. Leading category growth builds business for our retail partners and mathematically builds market share for P&G. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to contribute to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through the crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. In cost of goods, we're delivering flexible formulations that can allow us to change between ingredients to lower cost or create supply chain flexibility, while ensuring no impact on consumer preference for our brands. We're optimizing plastic bottle designs to reduce the amount of plastics we use, while also lowering costs. We're improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising investments, bringing some media planning work in-house to achieve greater cost efficiency, while also enabling us to place ads with greater precision based on more granular analytics to reduce waste and increase effectiveness. No area of cost is left untouched. We've given more authority and accountability to the business units to decide how to balance the need for more resources in some areas of the business with the opportunities for savings in other areas. They need to make the choices that are best for their business as they work to deliver a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Our success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption; a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to meet new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grows share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during the crisis, and they will serve us well on the other end of this crisis. We're confident they remain the right strategic choices as we move through and beyond the pandemic. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2021 in a very challenging environment. While we're pleased with these results and the overall strength of our business, the external environment continues to be volatile and difficult to predict and our eyes are wide open to the many challenges we face. We compete in product categories against highly-capable multinational and local competitors. Raw material and transport freight costs have risen sharply. Increased social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world are putting pressure on local GDP growth and the pandemic continues to create risk for consumers, retail partners and supply chains. With these challenges, there are also opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. The relevance of our categories in consumers' lives likely remains elevated. We will serve what will likely become a forever-altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home; more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There is potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly-framed problems better than alternatives; potentially less experimentation; potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We're discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources; today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and in our office environment. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We have the right strategies, we have the right portfolio, we have the right organizational structure. We have a team of 100,000 employees focused on executing to delight consumers, win with customers and deliver balanced growth and value creation. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2022. Andre? Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow through and beyond the crisis. We will manage what is likely to be a volatile near term, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exists in many parts of the world. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities, not back. We remain committed to our strategies and fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund investment and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth over the long term. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Okay. Let me start with the last part first. And then Andre can hit some of that the marketing spending numbers. But first, no, the marketer should not be worried. The marketer should feel wonderful, and that we've got a senior leadership that is maintaining a high degree of consistency. And you all know Jon very, very well. He has supported these investments in media, to the extent they grow the market and grow market share and are helping drive awareness and trial of superior products and brands. That's a good thing. It's about creating value, not reducing or increasing one element of cost. And Jon has been very engaged with me and the leadership team in these decisions. The other thing about our organization structure, we leave it to the sector CEOs and the enterprise leader to decide how much to invest in their businesses. This is not a decision we make at the headquarters. It's a decision made by each one of the business leaders and we hold them accountable to create the top and bottom-line growth and cash generation for their business. And I think the results the last three years speaks in themselves. And so, they actually should feel very good as do I, that the leadership of the company and the organization structures working very well. And one comment on the marketing spending efficiency, then Andre can add some additional comment. We have increased meaningfully the investment in marketing. But we have also increased the rate of meaningful innovation that grows the market. So, one of the key parts is you have to help consumers understand what the product is, how to use it, and then help drive awareness and trial. And these investments have done that. It's evidenced and again, in the top line growth, you recall very well. If you go back four or five years ago, our average growth was about 2%. We moved up to the past four years. Past five years, we've averaged 4%. In the last three years 6%.  And we've got the strongest share growth we've seen in many years, which tells me the combination of the superiority strategy and the brand execution by our people is really working. And we'll continue to invest behind both brands that are winning and invest to make sure we get the trial. And Andre, any comments on the specific numbers? Yes, very good. So, U.S. quarter four growth was a minus 1%. If you look on the two-year stack basis, that's 18%. Last year's quarter four was 19% growth and the strong growth in last year's quarter was mainly driven about 13 points, I believe by restocking retail inventories after strong consumption. So, in comparison, minus one on a 19% base. The U.S. consumption I think we believe at this point in time, we'll return to normal levels. Most importantly, we see our shares at record levels in the U.S. Our brands are continuing to strive. We're gaining share across categories. Our retail partnerships are strong and we have very strong innovation programs hitting in the U.S. So, we remain confident, but I think you're rightfully cautious in terms of base period effects, especially in the first half. On the China side, we expect the market to continue to grow mid singles. Our mantra is to grow ahead of that. And I would tell you the same thing I told you for the U.S. We feel good about the strength of our brands. In China, we feel good about our go-to-market capabilities, and we'll continue to invest in innovation and supporting those innovations in the market. Same comment considering base period is going to be prudent for China and the entire focus markets environment. A couple of comments about the consumer changes that we think are endearing, and then certainly Andre and Jon can jump in with some comments as well. We do believe that the health cleaning and hygiene brands will continue to play an increased role. There's some statistics that I saw a while back that pre-pandemic about 5% of people work from home, and then post-pandemic estimated 20. I don't know what the number will be, but certainly there's a significant number of people that will be in home more than they were pre-pandemic. That bodes well for us. I believe the strength of our brands and actually the shift toward trusted brands will likely last a good while we've had meaningful, increased household penetration on some of our brands as there was a stock-up and then people got exposed to the superior performance. I think that will have a lingering, positive impact. So, you've got both more people at home, not take the U.S. especially, more occasions at home. You've got a shift toward trusted brands and the role that health plan and hygiene place will anniversary some tough comps, but the health of the brands and the share of momentum. And to me, it gives me a lot of confidence going forward. The U.S. and Europe, I call it our biggest focus markets are having some of the strongest share progress they've had in every one of those categories. And absolute share is higher than they were pre-pandemic with the exception of family care that had a supply issue for the first part and just couldn't supply because the increased demand and their growing share in the fourth quarter. So, we've got good momentum, consumers continue to vote for trusted superior performing brands. And that I think those consumer habit changes will likely last. Sure. Happy to. First, it has been a challenging category for several years. And as we were very open several years ago, it would take time because the technical changes we need to make to deliver product superiority. And we continue to make those changes, but I'm actually very encouraged by the progress they've made. Our focus markets grew top line and profits last year. All-in profits increased global Baby Care made progress. Our North America business especially was plus 3%. The highest has been in six years. We're leading the category growth. We actually have strong share growth now in North America, most recent period, it's up a point or more. Our superiority metric, which is really important, back several years ago, it was 25%, which is unacceptable. It's up to 60% rising and we'll continue to be investing to again, delight consumers. But with North America doing better. Europe returned to growth for the first time in six years. You're right. It's been challenging, both the birth rate, but returned to growth, expanded the margins, we addressed some of the challenges we had in our enterprise markets. Jon and his team did a great job there working to make sure we had structurally profitable businesses and adjusting the business model and supply systems where need be. So, you look across those. And then this shift toward fast growth segments. Our wipes business was up 10%. Our pants business was up 12%. We doubled our bed wetter segment growth to 12% behind the successful Ninjamas launched. So, there's a number of things going well. We still have much work to do. And we understand that. Baby Care does take time, but this was the best year we've had in six years and the trends are positive. We're now playing in fast-growing segments and the product superiority is getting better each year. So, I become more optimistic on Baby Care each year. I think the leader and their team are doing a really nice job recognizing that this is a mid to long-term game and they're continuing to make the right investments. I'll give one quick comment and turn it to Andre. Javier, we have many tools to deal with the commodity cost increase. And one thing that is very clear is that hits everybody. That hits local brands, international brands equally in many ways more severely if you don't have scaled supply systems and the buying power that a company like P&G dash, where we work collaboratively with our suppliers. So, we've got the tools that include innovation, which I think is the strongest I've seen it in years. We have certainly pricing, but we have a very active productivity program. So, we've got the tools. If you get into specifics for Europe and others, I'm going to turn it to Andre to get into. But again, I think we're well positioned to deal with it, and we have our eyes wide open that it's going to be meaningful. And especially in some of the categories that have some of the increased amounts of raw materials that have been hit the most. Andre, you want to give any specific comments about Europe? Yes, I'll give comment now and I'll turn it to Jon. First, there are many opportunities, but it starts right here in the U.S. It's our largest market. We have \u2013 we declared several years ago, the U.S. is a growth market. We don't have any markets that aren't growth markets. It's our job to create the innovation that drives the growth. And I think it's best illustrated by the U.S. We are averaging 1% to 2% and we've moved to mid singles. And certainly, the last two years, we've been in high singles and it has driven by the innovation and the communication, just the superiority strategy being brought to health and executed in a very good way. We have had some bolt-on acquisitions that you're well aware of. There've been some categories that we've been open about. We added the Merck international business to our health care, and that's done very well. And you've seen the growth recently in our healthcare business. That remains an interesting segment. You've seen some bolt-on acquisitions in the beauty care business. Again, that remains an interesting business as well. And each of the sector leaders has the opportunity to evaluate whether they see bolt-on acquisitions or acquisitions that would be helpful. The core though is most important, driving the core and the focus markets, and then continuing to have smart growth and value creations in the enterprise markets is working. And I believe that's the right strategy. I'll turn it to Jon to offer any comments about how he's thinking about the future. But we've worked together on these and been aligned that it starts with delivering the core and seeing market growth is a key responsibility of each category. Some of you have heard me talk about this before, but there is a chart that I share with our leadership team whenever we're together. That highlights the importance of growth on both the topline and margin, and delivering top third, total shareholder return. We need to do both to dependably deliver a top third shareholder return over reasonable periods of time. So that will continue to be the focus and the emphasis. Having said that, margin as a metric, has many issues associated with it. The first being, I can't put margin in a bank, I can't return margin to share owners. What matters most is what Andre referred to, which is penny profit and overall profit and profitability. And we've got to make sure that we keep our eyes firmly on that as we work to grow the topline. Let me start with a couple of those. There are quite a few questions there. So, you have to help me if we don't answer each one. First, you mentioned a Beauty business and specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased if I just take SK-II as an example, you would have expected it to get hit very, very hard because of travel retail, virtually stopping in Asia. And it's certainly a huge channel. But the team pivoted amazingly well and was able to actually grow the business last year, the business was up double digits up 13%. So, SK-II is actually healthy and continues to run nicely because the consumption that did not happen in travel retail happened in the home market. And then there was the duty-free area in Heinemann province, they did a really nice job, making sure that the brand was both available and had the innovation and communication to win. So, SK-II is healthy, and I expect \u2013 I don't know when travel retail will resume, you can take your guess, it looks like it's going to be a while. But the good news is at the strong growth that we're seeing already, we're not dependent on that. It could be a help if and when it opens up anytime soon. More broadly the Skin and Personal Care business had a strong year last year as to the overall beauty business. So, again I feel very good about the business. How strong it grows next year will be dependent again on many of the factors that we've already mentioned. While there's meaningful cost headwinds, the innovation that both Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care has launched and will be launching I feel very good about. So, both businesses had strong years on the top and bottom line, and I feel good about those. Baby Care, I made a number of comments earlier, so I'm not sure what else would be helpful. Yes, we are very committed to the category. The innovation coming, and will continue to come. We are on the multi-year innovation program. Certainly, part of it has hit the market and you see that improvement in percent superiority from 25% to 60%. We will continue to work to move that up significantly. And we also recognize that for many consumers in the mini markets, the premiumization is critically important in these high growth areas. And that allows us to offset some of the challenges that you're well aware of on the birthright. And still grow the category, and grow share, and create value. And Baby Care did create value this year. It's a very strong year, strong improvement. So, all these businesses to me have meaningful upside. And especially the Beauty business has very good momentum and Baby Care is accelerating. So, I feel good about both. It's actually very balanced volume and pricing. But let me take one and then we can give the specific numbers. First, on Grooming, Grooming had a very strong year. They grew mid-single digits on the top and double digit on the bottom. Importantly, they grew share almost every segment across whether it was male shaved, female shave, appliance, all of those making very good progress, which contributed to the strong growth. And as you rightfully said, as people return to working outside the home, I think that will benefit the category. And what the team has done, which I think is very strong and very important going for the future, we're no longer a wet shave business. We're truly a Grooming business, with growth in wet shave, dry shave, which we call appliances. We're also growing in many of the new areas, like IPL, the intense pulsed light area, all of those to me, give me confidence and these new segments as well. We have innovation come on King C. Gillette, which helps people with facial hair. So, it's a broader portfolio, innovation across all those different forms and segments. And it's leading to mid singles top and double-digit bottom. So that's the strongest year we've had in many, many years in Grooming. And the reason is strong, should continue because it's innovation-driven, consumer-driven. I won't speculate too much on the relative out performance. What I can say is the strength of just what you said, the brands are strong and the measures we use, which I think are really important, our superiority metrics are relative to the best competitor in each brand, in each country. So, it pushes us to maintain and try to extend the advantage we have. Now we have full respect for our competitors. And you're right we have very strong growth in both North America, Europe, and Latin America. And in those markets that we'll see what happens next year. But if this share of growth has been now sustained in North America for three years and in Europe for three years. So, the focus markets are performing very well. And as John mentioned, we have very strong progress in the enterprise markets. We are mid singles with double digit growth in a very, very difficult environment. So that gives me confidence. We're at least well positioned. But the other thing is very real, you have to earn it every day. And so, our teams understand that our competitors are refocusing and those that lost share will come back with their innovations and investments. And it's our job to go earn it. But it's very clear that's what they're accountable to deliver. And based on the last three years, I've got confidence that we'll continue. So, I just offer a couple of thoughts. First, thank you for the kind words. The organization deserves a ton of credit and the total leadership team. But I appreciate your comments on me and very much agreeing to comments on John. In terms of trade promotion, certainly it's in our best interest to bring to our retail partners programs that build their business and build their margin. I do believe, as you said, that that can best be done by innovation and market growing plans. And there's walls they play with us and making sort of things like the shelf, but a virtual or physical shelf is arranged in a way that creates market growth and helps consumers find the brands that they're most apt to use. We worked with retail partners around the world. And the ones we've partnered with best success is they grow the market, grows, the margin grows and that we helped them do it, we get rewarded. So, we will continue with that certainly objective. Certainly, our eyes are wide open. I expect from a very low base, we will see an increase in trade spending. Do I believe it to go all the way back to what it was before? I think many retailers are very interested in finding smart ways and they have the same pressures that we do with the commodity costs, they need as well as we to find ways to create value. So, I'm hopeful that we'll see some thoughtful change in promotion strategy that is more value creating for the market. So, I'll let Andre comments on the hedging question just a second. The way I think about the retailers' approach to their business, I don't really think about it through an inventory lens so much as I think about it through a desire to maintain dependability of supply. And those manufacturers that can offer that assurance are often being rewarded with increased shelf space and increased focus on the part of our retail partners. There's a small amount of inventory bill, but that's not really the focus. The focus is on how do we ensure supply and maintain the satisfaction of our shoppers. And that's a very fertile place for us to apply. With regard to hedging Andre."

            "content": "And relative to the question on strategic changes as we go forward, we will always be responsive to consumers and customers whose needs will continue to evolve over time. I don't foresee that leading to any major change in the strategies that the team has been executing with excellence. But again, we will continue to be very attentive to and responsive to consumer and customer needs. Kevin, I really like, when you've heard me talk about this before each of the categories that we've decided to play in, as we've focused on strengthened our portfolio. And I firmly believe that they all have opportunity to grow and to create value. And you're seeing that, and the results that Andre described, for example, there's very broad progress that's occurring across those businesses. Similarly, from a geographic standpoint, what people would view as mature markets have significant growth potential that exists within them. You've seen the results in the U.S. If you look at category development outside of the U.S., on average is 20% of U.S. levels. So, there's significant opportunity across geographies to continue to develop these categories to grow markets and increased consumption. And historically, while we probably felt that way for the focus markets, we were a little bit concerned about what kind of future the enterprise markets held for us. But the team there has made significant progress in the last couple of years in dramatically increasing the structural profitability of those businesses. So, they are investment grade, and we can take advantage of the population on income growth that will occur in those markets and do so in a very profitable value accretive way. We exited last year with one country well over 100 countries and the enterprise markets losing any money. So, the majority are contributing positively to the company's topline and bottom line. So, I don't want to in any way backhand the question. But I really do believe that we have opportunities for growth and value creation in each of our categories and broadly across the global geography. And then it becomes executing the strategy that we've all talked about a number of times, and that as Andre mentioned, we will continue to double down on stepping forward, not back. And Andrea, to answer your question on the commodity exposure and freight exposure, we are forecasting a spot. So, we assume spot prices will sustain throughout the year. So, we don't expect an easing of these commodity pressures within the guidance that we've given. And on SK-II, what David said is certainly right. Growth is very strong 13% as David mentioned for the fiscal year, but 35% for quarter four. The pricing taken was mid-single. So, by far there is a significant volume component to it as the team shifted consumption into high non, which is a big part of the offset to travel retail reduction. So again, growth on SK-II is both volume and price mix driven. And just a reminder, excuse me. How you gain, share how we gained, share is very important in the answer to this question. And Dave has talked many times in our discussion this morning as is Andre about our intent to be a disproportionate driver of market growth. The math that falls out of that create share growth. But the notion that we're taking business from competitors, and it's only a matter of time and that that's not how we look at things. Our job is to be constantly expanding the pie, constantly expanding the number of households that we serve. And if we do that well, there's no reason that growth shouldn't be sustainable. Yes. And then to add a few numbers to David's statements quarter four in the U.S. we saw trade promotions, volumes sold on deals back to 27%, which was in line with quarter three, but it's still below pre-pandemic levels, which was around 33%. So, we're certainly getting back to a more normalized level in quarter four."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Joining David and me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of company results for fiscal 2021 and fourth quarter and David will add perspective on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2022. And then take your questions. Fiscal 2021 was another very strong year. Our focus on superiority and strong investment in the business, funded with strong productivity improvements and cost savings drove market growth, and it turns strong sales share earnings and cash results leading to balance growth and value creation. Organic sales for the fiscal year grew more than 6%, up more than 12% on a two-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with each our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Home Care up high teens, Oral Care up double digits, Skin and Personal Care up high single digits, Grooming, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Personal Health Care, organic sales each up mid-single digits, Family Care grew low singles, Baby Care was in line with prior year. We delivered strong results in our two largest and most profitable markets annualizing strong base periods. Organic sales were up 8% in the U.S. and 12% in greater China for the fiscal year. Focus markets grew 7% for the year. Enterprise markets were up 5% despite significant market growth impacts from the pandemic. E-commerce sales were up 35% for the year at over $10 billion in sales representing 14% of company total. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the fiscal year. All outlet value share in the U.S. improved through the year growing from 33% over the past 12 months, to 33.5% for the past six months, to 34% over the past quarter. One of the highest absolute value shares in the last 20 years. Consumers are increasingly choosing P&G brands. We translated the strong top-line growth into strong earnings and cash results. Core earnings per share grew 11% for the year. Currency neutral core EPS was also up 11%. Within this core gross margin expanded 20 basis points, up 60 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 80 basis points up 130 points, excluding currency impacts. Productivity improvements helped operating margin by 250 basis points, enabling strong \u2013 reinvestment in marketing programs. Advertising was a 10.8% of sales, an increase of more than 40 basis points. Adjusted free cashflow productivity was 107%. We increased our dividend by 10% and returned $19 billion of value to share owners, $8 billion in dividends and $11 billion in share repurchase. Moving on to the April, June quarter, organic sales grew 4%, volume, pricing and mix, each contributed more than one point to topline growth. Growth rates by market reflected the volatility and shipments and the base period. Organic sales were down 1% in the U.S. However, this is still 18% growth on a two-year stack. Recall that in the April, June quarter last year, organic sales were up 19% in the U.S. 13 points above track channel sales as we work to restock depleted trade inventories. Organic sales in greater China were up 5% also comping a strong base period, on a two-year stack, Greater China up 19%. Focus markets were up 2%, enterprise markets were up 14% in the quarter. Strong market share trends with aggregate global value share up 70 basis points. All the share in the U.S. increased 260 basis points for the quarter to 34.1%.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.13, down 3% versus prior year, down 4% on a currency neutral basis, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input cost as we had anticipated. Core gross margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core gross margin also down 260 points. This includes 220 basis points impact from higher commodity and freight costs, nearly 400 million in just this quarter. We also saw a sharp headwind from mix of 210 basis points, mainly geographic mix impacts. Recall that in our fourth quarter last year, the U.S. and China accounted for more than 100% of organic sales growth. In this year's fourth quarter Enterprise Markets lead the growth. Core operating margin decreased 230 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 210 basis points. Productivity improvements were 320 basis point helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was 117%. In summary, we exceeded each of our growth targets for the year. Organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free chase productivity, and cash returned to shareholders. Our team has operated with excellent discipline in a challenging and volatile environment. And with that, I'll pass it back to David. As David said, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the crisis. Our quarterly results will be heavily influenced by top-line volatility embedded in base period results, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Input costs have risen sharply. Current spot prices for materials such as resins, chemicals and other ingredients are up anywhere from 30% to 200% versus April 2020. Most of the material cost increases occurred in this calendar year and will disproportionately affect the first half of fiscal 2022. Based on current spot prices, we estimate a $1.8 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Freight costs have also increased substantially due to several factors affecting the supply of drivers and the demand for drivers and trucks and diesel fuel prices are up 35% so far in the calendar. We currently expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $100 million after-tax headwind in fiscal 2022. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases, but there is a lag between the time when costs begin to rise and when pricing is implemented to provide an offset. As discussed last quarter, our Baby Care, Feminine Care and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced increases in the U.S. that will go into effect in mid-September. Earlier this year, we executed a significant product upgrade on our Japan liquid Ariel detergent, coupled with a 35% price increase. In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently announced that this price increase on Tide Simply, Cheer, and Era liquid detergents, effective in September. In U.S. Home Care, we've announced double-digit price increases across all product forms of the Swiffer brand. These increases are effective mid-September. We have announced price increases in many Central Eastern European markets to offset a portion of recent currency impacts. In Latin America, we've taken a cumulative high-single-digit price increase across our business over the past 12 months. We are analyzing input costs and foreign exchange rate impacts on other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. When opportunities allow, we will close couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. We believe this is a temporary bottom-line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business and not a reason to redesign a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Our guidance ranges for fiscal 2022 incorporate these dynamics. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The high end of this range assumes global markets continue growing at about 3% or so and P&G continues to grow above market level. The low end of this range assumes deterioration in global markets to 2% or lower with P&G growth at or above underlying markets. This range also reflects the strong organic sales growth, more than 8%, that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021. Given this base period dynamic, we expect organic sales growth to be stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022 versus the front half. On the bottom-line, we expect core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%. This outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.9 billion from \u2013 after-tax from commodity cost of freight, as I mentioned earlier, with a modest offset, overall, of $100 million after-tax from foreign exchange rate benefits. The combined impact of materials, freight and FX is approximately a $0.70 per share headwind to EPS or a 12%-point headwind to EPS growth in fiscal 2022. Considering the costs challenge is weighted heavily towards the front half of the year. Our earnings growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% starting the year. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase between $7 billion and $9 billion of common stock; combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now back to David for closing comments. Look, I think we've increased our ad spending year-over-year in fiscal 2021 versus 2020 by $850 million. And as David said, superior communication is a core element of our superiority framework and we've not reached the point of diminishing return on those investments. So, we'll continue to invest at around that level in percent of sales. We also do believe that there is significant productivity improvements still within the media spend. When you think about shift into digital media improved targeting capability with first party audiences or third-party audiences and ability to sharpen our focus, even on TV audiences with our own data. So there continues to be a significant leverage in terms of direct media spend efficiencies that we can create to improve quantity of reach and quality of reach. In the indirect space, we also striving to continue to improve production costs agency structures. So you'll see us continue to work in that direction mostly to reinvest in superiority and superior communication. What I'd say, maybe I think our portfolio positions us well. There were many categories that did not benefit from COVID tailwinds in our portfolio. When you think about adult incontinence, deodorants, shave care, some of the tooth whitening that we see coming back, Personal Health Care had a very low cough-cold season with everyone wearing masks and our professional business certainly that serves hotels and restaurants did not do well. So as mobility increases, those businesses pick up and we see that as a positive going forward obviously. Geographically, many of the markets we operate in specifically the enterprise markets never did see a benefit in terms of consumption from COVID as consumers and retailers were impacted by the crisis. So hopefully as these markets work through the pandemic, that will also provide a tailwind from a geographic standpoint. What I would say is similar to what David mentioned, I think productivity is going to be a core driver of the offsets that we will continue to focus on. The commodity pressures that we're seeing as you have heard broad based in the industry and therefore the same pressures exist in the market around the world. In terms of pricing, we've mentioned that we've taken and announced pricing in Central and Eastern European markets. We've announced pricing in the U.S., which you referenced, and we've also have taken pricing and cumulatively high single digits in Latin America over the past 12 months. We will continue to evaluate pricing opportunities around the world. And we are encouraged, I think by our ability to execute pricing in the markets where we have announced. But I cannot comment on any additional pricing that we might or might not take again, that is within the discretion of the sector leaders. And we'll come out as we see fit. So, I think, as David explained and Jon explained we are very pleased with the categories we're operating in. I think they all offer continued growth opportunity. If you think about either growing the market via innovation with the examples that David mentioned earlier, if you think about trading consumers up into premium propositions will have superior profitability in terms of penny profit for us. If you, for example, liquid fabric enhancers, household penetration in the U.S. is only 37% and only 52% of those households use fabric enhancer with every load. So, there's tons of runway. When you think about beats [ph], those numbers are even lower. Those propositions accretive to all portfolio, are accretive to all margins and we'll continue to focus on those. And they provide a good source for future growth, both top and bottom line. Productivity is another key lever that still has enormous runway across the balance sheet and across the P&L. Our supply chain continues to have significant opportunity in terms of synchronization. But also, every innovation that we bring basically creates a new cost S curve that we can then optimize from. We talked about media and advertising spend as a significant source of future profitability, growth and productivity. And I would add, go-to-market specifically in terms of go-to-market logistics, but also go-to-market spend as a source So, we feel confident in our ability to deliver, even with cost headwinds, which is reflected in our guidance for next year. And we do believe there's enough leavers in the portfolio from trade up, to usage expansion, to be able to continue to do so. So, yes, the short answers that $1.9 billion that we've communicated is the net impact to P&G."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-End Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Let me quickly summarize another strong quarter and then turn it over to Andre to provide additional perspectives. Organic sales were up 4% on the quarter, up 10% two-year stacked. Global market share was up 40 basis points. Fiscal year-to-date through three quarters, organic sales are up 7%. Core earnings per share up 8% on the quarter, up 14% fiscal year-to-date.Free cash flow productivity over 100%. We are on track to deliver the top and bottom line guidance we have raised twice this fiscal. We are increasing estimates for the third time for free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, which Andre will take us through. One more very important highlight, a 10% dividend increase, which we announced last Tuesday. The team has been managing very successfully with priorities I will describe again later through volatility, uncertainty and some extreme challenges. COVID reopening in some markets increased viral spread, renewed lockdown and severe economic impact in others. Some family is growing at very high rates, others essentially shut; FX and commodity volatility; event specific challenges like the blockage of the Suez Canal; transportation demand mismatched with supply; market-specific dynamics impacting operations in countries like Argentina, Myanmar and Lebanon; and a very mild cough cold season. That\u2019s just a very quick synopsis of strong top line, bottom line and cash results in a very challenging environment with a huge thanks to our team. For more perspective, Andre?\nAndre Schulten: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Jon said, the March quarter was another period of good top line, bottom line and market share growth, along with strong cash generation and strong cash returns to shareowners. Organic sales were up 4% for the quarter, volume in line with year ago, 2 points of pricing, 2 points of positive mix. Organic sales growth was mixed across regions. Overall focus markets grew 5%, with strong growth in our two largest markets: U.S. organic sales, up 7%; and Greater China sales were up 22%. European focus markets were down 2%, largely due to the impact of lockdowns in the region. Japan was down 5%. Enterprise markets were up 1% and were also mixed within the region. Latin America, up 8%; Asia, Middle East, Africa, in line with year ago quarter; and European enterprise markets were down 4%. We delivered strong organic sales growth in most categories: Home Care, up high-teens; Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care, up high singles; Family Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; Fabric Care, up low singles. Feminine Care organic sales were down low singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe, but share trends remained strong in the region and on a global basis. Baby Care was down mid singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe and heightened competitive activity in China. Importantly, Baby Care all outlet value share in the U.S. is up 130 basis points over the past one month and 80 basis points over the past three months. Personal Health Care organic sales were down mid singles, driven by a very weak cold flu season on top of difficult comparisons in the base period. U.S. sales in the respiratory category were down more than 40% in this March quarter versus last year. Despite the weak category trends, Vicks\u2019 share was up for the quarter. E-commerce sales were up at about 50% fiscal year-to-date with no notes for change in shopping trends in the quarter. E-comm sales represent 14% of our global sales, aggregate market share growth of 40 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were $1.26, up 8%, currency neutral core EPS also up 8%. Core margin was up 30 basis points, up 80 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin was in line with prior year, up 30 basis points, excluding currency impacts. We generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow with free cash flow productivity at 106%. We returned $5 billion in cash to shareholders, $2 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend, reflecting strong results and confidence in our future. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 131st consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, three quarters into the year, organic sales up 7%, with global value share growing, core EPS, up 14%; ex-FX, up 16%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%, $14 billion of cash returned to shareowners, which is 120% of all-in earnings. Back to you, Jon.\nJon Moeller: As shared in previous discussions, we have established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority is supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and which are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We have focused our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we have raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category market growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We are continuing to invest in and behind superior offerings. We launched Dawn Powerwash just over a year ago. Its superior formula and unique spray technology provide powerful suds that cut grease on contact. Powerwash has become a welcome addition to consumers\u2019 dish care regimen with so many more meals being cooked at home. Powerwash delivered around $150 million in year one sales and was a significant contributor to Dawn\u2019s U.S. all outlet market share growth of more than 400 basis points over the period. Pampers Baby Dry in the U.S. took another step forward towards regaining superiority across all vectors. Baby Dry recently launched innovation, providing more absorbency, improved comfort and better leakage protection for dry and healthy skin. Product graphics were refreshed with improved leakage protection queues and packaging was upgraded to introduce the claim number one pediatrician recommended and hypoallergenic with no parabens or latex. Innovation includes improved in-store displays and online messaging to highlight the improved product packaging and communication. It\u2019s still very early in the launch as new products and packages just began shipping in the last month and we are now just starting full commercialization. But this initiative represents an important step in reestablishing superiority in the mid-tier on Baby Care. Tide and Ariel are expanding their 2030 brand ambition to focus on decarbonizing laundry at every step, from design, manufacturing and distribution to consumer use and end of life, while maintaining superior cleaning performance. Ariel\u2019s new campaign, Every Degree Makes a Difference, advocates lower washing temperatures, up to 60% of laundry\u2019s carbon footprint comes from heating the water in washing machines. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can all do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To do this, we continue to innovate to ensure superior performance in cold water. In China Hair Care, two examples of premium innovation launched in the fast growing conditioner and treatment segments. Pantene Quench Shot masks and 3-Minute Miracle has successfully attracted new consumers to the Pantene brand as well as expanded the regimen of current Pantene shampoo consumers. These innovations have contributed to over 35% market growth in these segments online over the past 12 months. Greater China Hair Care organic sales are up mid-teens fiscal year-to-date and were up 25% this quarter led by conditioners and treatments. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of ongoing productivity. We are driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, following some new demands, seamlessly supporting each other, to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They are reinforced and build on each other. We executed well. They grow markets, which in turn grow share of sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these more recent volatile times that we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. We are optimistic about our crisis prospects and generally like our hand. We will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move through the crisis and quarterly results will not move in a straight line and are more difficult to predict. In many countries, the number of COVID cases unfortunately are the worst they have been. Risk of supply chain disruption remains high. Channel closures will likely continue. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to hold ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With that context, back to Andre to discuss guidance.\nAndre Schulten: So, with three strong quarters behind us and having raised guidance twice across all key metrics we are maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth and core EPS growth for the fiscal year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash returns to shareowners. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. This outlook reflects continued volatility from both base period and current year dynamics, including a challenging fourth quarter base period in the U.S. and in Greater China and continued soft market conditions in Europe and in enterprise markets. Our core earnings per share guidance remains in the range of 8% to 10%. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $150 million after-tax of foreign exchange and now more than $200 million after-tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are now forecast to be a headwind of approximately $125 million after tax. This is a $400 million swing to the negative since our initial guidance for the year with much of this impact affecting our fiscal fourth quarter. As we stand today, our internal estimates for organic sales growth are above the midpoint of the fiscal year guidance range. On the bottom line, we are trending towards the midpoint of the core EPS range. We are again raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% starting the year to now over 100%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook for share repurchase from up to $10 billion to approximately $11 billion. Combined, we plan to return about $19 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. The commodity cost challenges we faced this year will obviously be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that will go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid to high single-digits. As opportunities allow, we will close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers. We are analyzing raw material and foreign exchange impacts in other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. Back to Jon for closing comments.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum as I said earlier well before the COVID crisis. We have strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve to heighten needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we have outlined many times and again, this morning and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We are stepping forward, not back. We are doubling down to serve our consumers and our communities. We are doing this in our interest, in the society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. We look forward to talking with you through the quarter and look forward to having David join us on the year end call in July, when we will provide our initial outlook for fiscal \u201822. With that, we will be happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good morning. So on the pricing and commodity front, Jon, you have been in the corporate finance or leadership role for almost 15 years now. So, can you just give us some perspective on this commodity spike and what we are seeing in terms of magnitude versus past cycles and your view on longevity? And then on the pricing front, as a response to that, I know you are not going to want to be precise on forward pricing. But just holistically, given the large magnitude of this commodity increase, I would love to get a bit of a sense even if it\u2019s nebulous on what sort of the end goal is with pricing eventually? Is it to fully cover commodity increases? Is it to mostly cover? It\u2019s obviously a timing lag, but sort of the ultimate offsets to higher cost through pricing, any perspective there? And then last and apologies for the multipart question, but you are in the fortunate position of strong market share gains heading into this pricing cycle and kudos obviously a lot of hard work to be in that position. But how might that change your willingness to be bolder on pricing or even put at risk some of those market share gains that you do in fact take pricing? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Dara. First, in comparison to prior cycles, this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we\u2019ve seen over the period of time that I have been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time. That\u2019s not all bad. When commodities move significantly and obviously they affect everyone, including both manufacturer brands and own label retail brands, the industry has pushed to price. When they move modestly, it can be much more difficult in that regard. We are also blessed to have very strong innovation in market and coming to market, which provides an opportunity to price in a value-accretive manner. We define value holistically. And we will be looking \u2013 our overall objective is to cover cost increases. It\u2019s important \u2013 and I want to emphasize that, because I didn\u2019t say cover or restore margin. It\u2019s covering cost increases, which is inherently a little bit margin-dilutive, but we think that strikes the right balance, particularly when we can combine that pricing with innovation and increased perception of value across the portfolio. If we do that well, we should continue to grow markets, and we have talked about the math of growing markets. We do that disproportionately, which is certainly our intention. We will not lose share. We will, in effect, well, necessarily build share. All of that is easy to talk about. All of that is hard to execute. And it\u2019s done at a very detailed level by brand, by market. And so it will play out differently across the world. The last very important point on this topic I want to make, if we go back to large commodity cost increase cycles in the past, this company had not yet fully embedded productivity into its mindset and activity system, and that will be a significant part of this endeavor going forward as well. And we feel good about opportunities to continue to increase productivity to help us manage this situation.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, good morning. I actually wanted to ask about your approach to some of the markets like India. To the extent COVID runs rampant, gets worse, I know in the developed markets over the last 9 months, 12 months, it wasn\u2019t easy for you, but you were able to offset sort of some of the supply chain disruptions, e-commerce took off, all of that. But I am just wondering how you plan to manage in a place like India or some of the other enterprise markets, Africa, if COVID is a lingering problem, and you don\u2019t have the e-commerce option nearly as much in those markets. Is there a risk that those regions turn significantly negative for you or significantly more expensive to operate? Just how are you thinking about that and planning for that at this point? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thank you, Wendy. Many of these markets do indeed represent significant challenges, and I think it\u2019s important we talk about that a little bit. So, that\u2019s why I appreciate the question. The health situation in markets like India, Brazil, Turkey is worse than it\u2019s ever been. The number of new cases, the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths, unfortunately, was higher in the last week and over the weekend than has ever been the case. These markets do not have the healthcare infrastructure nor the financial means to provide subsidies to their citizenry. And as a result, when this happens, employment is affected. Consumption is affected. GDP is down significantly in some of these markets. No better time to help and to serve our consumers at a time of real need. We need to do that in a profitable way. And frankly, we, knock on wood, have never been more profitable in enterprise markets than we are as we sit here conversing today. So, the operational discipline that\u2019s required is significant. We will have to make choices, but I fully expect, to the main point of your question, that these will be markets that will continue to offer top and bottom line growth opportunities for our company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thanks. Can we talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in baby and family, specifically, because you call out retailer destocking and higher competitive activity, I guess just curious if you see that continuing. And if so, I guess, how does that impact your decision to follow what we heard from Kimberly-Clark on announced pricing in the U.S., but doing so on a 2.5-month to 3-month lag and seemingly only on baby and feminine and incontinence \u2013 yet not on Family Care categories. So, just how should investors interpret that tactical positioning in the context of ultimately doing what\u2019s optimal for category growth? And I guess kind of relatively, is there anything that you have announced today preclude other revenue growth management activities that might help drive higher net price in Baby and Family overall as we go forward. I guess, specifically, I am thinking about potential de-sheeting or other kind of net price accretive activities in tissue categories that might not be a list price increase? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Steve, let me briefly address family, and then I am going to ask Andre to comment on Baby Care since U.S. Baby Care was the business that he led most recently. He is still very close to what\u2019s happening there. We are pricing in the three categories that you mentioned because that\u2019s where the commodity costs are \u2013 the increases are the more significant. It\u2019s really that simple. From a Family Care standpoint, demand continues to be strong. We grew Family Care 5% in the quarter that we just completed. That\u2019s even despite some reduction in household pantry inventory. But the usage at home continues to be above pre-COVID levels, and we are managing the balance between home inventory, store inventory and our own production very, very carefully. But the price increases for the near-term are going to be focused, as you rightly mentioned, in baby, family and adult incontinence, the largest of those is baby. I will ask Andre to comment on that.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. As you mentioned, I think quarter 3 was significantly impacted due to retailer inventory build in the early phases of the pandemic and Europe focus markets and in the U.S. We expect that to normalize over the next few quarters. Most importantly, the team is really focusing on building irresistible superiority across all vectors in baby, every form and every price tier. And where we do that successfully, we see the results turning. You have heard us talk about U.S. value share being up 130 basis points plus 1. In Europe, where we have also invested in superiority, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, are all up in terms of value share significantly in excess of a point. So, bringing innovation at the same time as we price is the ideal scenario, which we are pushing in the U. S. Now slower growth rates and commodity pressures will continue to be headwinds. So, we need to acknowledge that. So productivity will also be a continued element of that toolbox we have to use to drive growth. But as we focus on superiority, drive market value, we have a business model that works as illustrated in the U. S. and Europe.\nOperator: Alright. Next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning, I wanted to talk a little bit about the role that top-line growth plays in, I guess, profitability. So, just thinking through the streamlined organization structure, not thinking about incremental productivity, but just rather the benefit that you see to profitability from top-line growth here, what sort of \u2013 is it 3%, 4%, where you see material operating leverage, particularly at the gross margin line, but also in SG&A. And then related to that, 2020 was a year where there was remarkable reinvestment into the business and that the share gains speak to that. But as you look ahead to \u201822, I guess how would you describe the status of your commercial plan, are you fully funded at current investment levels, is there a need to kind of keep ramping up at this rate or is the spend level feel about right where it is today? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Let me make just a few overarching comments, Lauren, and then have Andre talk about the income statement \u2013 leverage and the top-line growth leverage that you asked about. And the first overarching comment I want to make is we are literally just beginning to put together plans for \u201822. So, I apologize, but we really don\u2019t have anything terribly intelligent or cohesive to talk about that. I do not expect, however, our priorities to change. I do not expect our strategy to change. I do not expect our business model to change. But the specifics of that are early in their development, and we look forward to talking to you about that, along with David, in July. I will turn it over to Andre just to talk about the income statement leverage.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. So to answer your question, our \u2013 we are growing mid-singles, so call it 3% to 4% on top-line. We have started to see some modest benefit to sales leverage. It really starts to gain traction above 4% growth rate across the income statement, and that\u2019s what we have seen, I think in the most recent quarters. So, that\u2019s a sweet spot where we want to be. Mid-singles growth allows for sustained margin expansion, which is our growth model that we are going after.\nJon Moeller: Of course, that\u2019s all in the context of for example, relatively constant commodity costs and no significant impacts from currency, etcetera. Our current outlook for market growth, and again, this changes on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, would be between 3% and 4%, likely rounding to 4%. Our objective is to grow ahead of that by disproportionately contributing to market growth. So, that would put us in the margin square that Andre outlined, again, prior to big impacts from other commodities or currency.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. I think you spot me in. Much appreciate it. I wanted to make sure I understood the guidance comments, because to get to above the midpoint of your sales outlook, but only to the midpoint or so of the EPS outlook, I need to take my EBIT margins down close to 300 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to think about it or are there other below the line headwinds to contemplate? And if we are talking about that type of margin degradation in the fourth quarter, can you give us more color on the puts and takes, is this an investment posture or is it just the commodities are hitting a lot of gross margin pressure before pricing sets in, any sort of context or color you can provide to help us dimensionalize that? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thank you. Why don\u2019t I let Andre start on that and I will jump in.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. I think overall, I think you are reading it the right way. On the top-line, we see ourselves above the midpoint of the guidance range. On the EPS side, the main drivers, I would call out that will impact the balance of the fiscal year are macro factors. When you think about commodities, we had a 1% EPS headwind in quarter 3. But now we have included $125 million after-tax headwinds for commodities in the guidance. That will largely hit in quarter 4. Foreign exchange rate continues to be a headwind $150 million after tax, which is up $50 million versus what we have talked in our quarter 2 call. And then transportation would be the last element I would mention, at about $200 million after-tax included in the current guidance. Rates continue to be up. Drivers and rigs continue to be in short supply. Sea freight continues to be at a premium. So, we continue to see that pressure mounting and also impacting quarter two.\nJon Moeller: We will also continue to the point of your question on a couple of \u2013 previously, to maintain a very healthy investment profile to continue to hold and build our margin of superiority. And we will also continue, obviously, with our strong productivity program, which we will fund by effort. And with that, we are left back where Andre left us.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Jon, I wanted to come back to the topic of pricing and commodities because I think it\u2019s important. So, just in the interest of clarity here, the pricing that you outlined for the U.S. in baby, fem and adult care comes behind Kimberly\u2019s announcement. But then to an earlier question, as you commented, this is one of the bigger commodity cost increases that the industry has had to cope with historically. So, I just wanted to come back, why only these categories and why only the U.S., because it\u2019s certainly far beyond just pulp. And then within that context, Jon, to your credit and to the team\u2019s credit, Procter has done a remarkable job here in terms of improving market share to put the company in a position to take price behind the leading brand portfolio in these circumstances. So, I think the question is what is giving you pause here in terms of broader pricing beyond just the categories where you are seeing it following Kimberly\u2019s pricing announcement. So, why just these categories and why just the U.S.? And then I am sorry for being a little bit verbose here, but just on commodity outlook, I think to the extent that you can quantify, I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance, but some further degree of quantification beyond just June, beyond just your fiscal year, I think would be helpful for folks? So, thank you for all that.\nJon Moeller: Thank you, Kevin. Pricing is a topic that we are limited in the perspective that we can actually provide relative to specific brands in country and in plans that relate to specific brands and countries. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would suggest that we not take that reality and conclude necessarily, but the only categories we are taking pricing in are the ones that have been mentioned. And the only country that we are taking pricing is the one that has been mentioned. This will be a holistic effort with productivity in mind, with innovation in mind. We are \u2013 our business model positions us on a relative basis well to deal with these situations for 2 reasons. One I have just mentioned, which is productivity is part of the culture, part of our DNA. We don\u2019t have to start a program. Our program for next year is well underway. The second is an even more important way, is an innovation based business model, which positions us with opportunities to take pricing in a way that\u2019s actually value accretive to consumers. And you can imagine that if you have those opportunities and they are spread out across the year, your pricing might be announced at different timing and might take effect at different times throughout the year. I would offer you 1 data point or 2 data points. Pricing has been, and it speaks to the business model point. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top-line \u2013 sorry, a neutral or a positive contributor, but mostly positive to our top-line for 42 quarters out of the last 46 quarters and 15 years out of the last 16 years. That doesn\u2019t guarantee anything going forward, but it points to the \u2013 again, the nature of our business model, which provides no guarantees, but does put us in a relatively better position with ways to help the top-line and the bottom-line as we work to manage this and continue to create value. Relative to the question on impact of commodities for next year, as I said earlier, we are really early in the process of putting next year together, couple that with a very volatile, both commodity and FX environment, and I would rather help you with specifics that are meaningful, closer to the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. With 14% of your sales now coming from e-commerce, and I think you said growing 50%, that\u2019s pretty much all the growth, so in that context and given the fact that channel continues to spread, it\u2019s not just Amazon, it\u2019s Walmart and Target, can you ask \u2013 answer two questions? One, how \u2013 and maybe just the U.S. and China, how has that channel and the competition in that channel evolved over the last year or so? And what specific things can you point to that you are working on now that will give you superiority in that channel on a sustainable basis? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Robert. The figures you referenced relative to channel growth are the correct figures as we see them. The growth is significant in both U.S. and China. Both markets have become even more competitive in the e-commerce channel, but I would argue that was true in brick-and-mortar channels as well or global market places becoming more global. And there is strong and healthy competition across channels and markets. The biggest opportunity for us from a superiority standpoint in the e-commerce channel, there are several. But fundamentally, first, second and third is, as you mentioned, superiority. That carries the day in this channel and categories where performance drives brand choice, as much as it does in every other channel. Now we need to scale our offerings in a way that best serve e-commerce and digital commerce consumers. And an example of one of the things we\u2019re working on there is packaging, particularly for liquid products, ensuring those products survive the journey to a consumer\u2019s home and when she opens box with delight. The conditions that, that bottle travels through are much more strenuous in an e-commerce context, and we need to have packaging that\u2019s designed for that in mind. So that\u2019s just an example. But the mindset of superiority across everything is the same in that channel as well as any other channels. Andre, I don\u2019t know if you have any more perspective on that question from a Baby Care perspective.\nAndre Schulten: Well, the only other point I would make is I think the strength of our brands is a big effort when you come to e-comm. It ensures that we can be on the landing page in the search top results. I think the strength of our brands also plays to when you think about click and collect, our availability in terms of shells and therefore not being increase up for another Brent when we are out of stock, I think is a big advantage. So our logistics capability, I think, can create value in conjunction with retailers in the supply chain that is driven by e-com. So I think there are many areas of strength that we can apply to make sure we\u2019re competitive in that environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. So Jon, I was wondering if you can just talk about out of stocks. And from the standpoint of COVID-related demand, but it\u2019s more about the supply chain tension between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar, just given the prior \u2013 Robert\u2019s prior question about just the enormous growth that we\u2019re seeing and all the retailers are getting much more involved or much more aggressive in that channel. So just was hoping to get some context around that? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Encouragingly, in-stock and available on shelf is becoming a very common language for us and our retail partners. It is front and center in the development of our joint business plans, and we have opportunities there, as do our retail partners. And that landscape of opportunities is changing all the time. Andre mentioned click and collect. That presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities as it relates to having products available. We\u2019re well positioned in that space, as he mentioned. But this is an area that is receiving a lot of intentional focus both internally and, importantly, in partnership with our retail partners.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning and welcome, Andre. I wanted to go back to the pricing commentary, and I know we\u2019ve beaten up this topic a lot, but I understand you can\u2019t preannounce pricing for pretty much other categories. But in past cycles, we used innovation in packaging and distributing, also I understand that you don\u2019t necessary need to publicly announce pricing outside the U.S. So what are the other reasons you have seen room for price/mix to move in the right direction? And also, you talked about increasing competitive activity in leading China. So how are you planning to respond to that? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: I think I caught most of that. We\u2019re going to refrain from commenting specific pricing moves in any country across any category. That\u2019s just a better place to be. Again, we\u2019ve talked a lot about intent on this call and we\u2019ve talked about mechanism and method on this call, and I think those are clear. And the rest, we are going to have to stay tuned if available. It also would not make a lot of sense for us to talk about price increases in certain markets and certain categories without having had a discussion with our retail partners. So I\u2019m really \u2013 I apologize, but I said what I could say on pricing, I think it\u2019s very constructive in terms of both our intent and our ability to balance that in a way that makes sense for everybody.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you everybody. Can you talk a bit about the mix effects on margins? Obviously, the U.S. and China were quite strong last year. And now you are going to be comping a lot of that and what you are seeing from recovering at the end? And then also within kind of the context of mix but more from a channel perspective, maybe an update on what you\u2019re seeing and expecting for travel retail? Thanks. \nJon Moeller: I will turn it over to our CFO to help you with mix.\nAndre Schulten: Alright. So from a gross margin perspective, you will have seen, we have about a negative 40 basis points from mix. We\u2019re actually being helped by the strong growth that we see in the U.S. and China from a region mix perspective. But you see negative segment mix impact in the quarter mainly driven by faster growth in Home Care and in Appliances and personal healthcare being down on the quarter. I want to call out that negative 40 basis points is not necessarily a negative structurally. Many of our premium propositions in the market come with significantly higher unit sales and unit profit, though with slightly dilutive gross margin mix impact, when you think about, for example, 50% premium on a unit sales basis, 20% higher penny profit, but minus 6% on a margin perspective. So, the same is true for Pampers Pure. When you think about fem care radiant variants, so premiumization, to some degree, carries a margin impact, but we much prefer the penny profit over the margin as we follow that strategy.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I actually just wanted to ask you question about SK-II perhaps also Olay in just specifically China, you see some big numbers out of China from other companies not specifically Skin Care and perhaps just a little bit surprise of the sequential development in that business specifically on the easier comps. So, I wonder if you could just talk to how your SK-II business specifically and Olay came in relative to your expectations and, in general, what you are seeing from the Asian Skin Care market in general? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: There is a lot going on within Asia Skin Care. For many of the prestige beauty companies, big parts of their business were severely impacted by COVID. Think about salon-based treatments, offerings that went through specialty beauty channels, which are effectively shut, as an example, travel retail. And as a result, they are smartly investing in a category that continues to offer significant growth, is very profitable and is open, and that is China Skin Care. So, one dynamic that we have happening is a lot of competitive activity. That\u2019s not inherently bad. That grows markets. And if you look at, for example, SK-II, we grew SK-II globally strong double digits, over 30% in the quarter that we just completed. Within that, Mainland China, we grew over 50%. Part of that dynamic is something else that\u2019s going on, which is the movement of purchase from travel retail and from travel in general, so for example, consumers traveling to Japan to buy prestige beauty products, which they are no longer doing. That purchase that, consumption has not gone away, and that purchase is shifting into the Chinese market, which is feeding significant growth if you report business on a mainland China basis. But it\u2019s very encouraging that we\u2019re delivering the growth that we are in SK-II. It\u2019s been a little bit tougher for Olay, simply because one of the mechanisms that companies are using to compete and take advantage of this opportunity is to reduce prices. And so the gap between Olay and some of the others kind of changes the competitive dynamic. And quite frankly, we need to work to premiumize our lines even more to be fully competitive with some of these brands, which we\u2019re in the midst of doing. But overall, beauty grew 7%. Skin and Personal Care grew 7%. Hair Care grew 7%. We\u2019ve grown organic sales for 22 quarters. It\u2019s a business we really like, and SK-II is an important part of it, as is Olay.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask just more broadly about how to think about operating margins on a go-forward basis, not necessarily from a guidance perspective, but just how much of the pretty strong EBIT margin expansion we\u2019ve seen kind of since fiscal \u201819, depending on where you come in, in 4Q, something 250 basis points or more, mainly led by gross margin? How much of that should we be thinking about sticking in the business? I hear you on the commodities and the pricing and pricing to protect how you were referring to before on margin. So can you maybe help us a little bit more about how much of that is maybe leverage from stronger sales and how much of that can actually continue on a go-forward basis? Maybe just sort of puts and takes that we don\u2019t necessarily see in looking at the numbers.\nJon Moeller: Well, certainly, a continuation of sales growth rate is important to maintain some level of margin growth rate. And we\u2019ve been very clear about that from the beginning. I also think that you need to be careful when you think just about commodities in terms of its effect on the gross margin, even on a net basis of pricing because that\u2019s not the only thing going on. So for example, there have been significant cost increases associated with COVID in terms of being able to operate safely and successfully that we would expect over some period of time, God willing, as we get through this, both here and in other countries could be an opportunity for productivity and cost reduction. So this \u2013 I\u2019ve talked about this many times, but there is a chart that I show our leadership team meeting, our team whenever we get together, which simply shows the importance of the combination of sales growth and margin growth and delivering top third TSR. And the simple fact is that if we don\u2019t grow margin and we want to deliver top third TSR, we would need to be comfortable sustainably growing sales, organic sales 8% every year. And that\u2019s not something that our industry has historically done. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve historically done, but we remain committed through our innovation programs, through productivity, through the right amount of pricing to continue some level of operating margin growth.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much guys. I wanted to follow-up maybe for a finer point in an earlier line of questions. E-commerce, we talked about for years about what it would look like we saw this level of e-commerce dramatically higher. And I wanted maybe to put \u2013 I know that varies widely by category and by region. You mentioned the U.S. and China. I know categories were pretty significant as well. So I would ask, are you as stronger in categories that have developed more in e-commerce? And are you more profitable in totality, in your judgment, in those categories? And I asked that because I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going in a lot of categories, and I think that affects the overall competitive look 5 years down the road. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: I would say that our position as regards superiority, again, in categories where performance drives brand ice and our advantage versus competition in that regard as well as the other vectors of superiority has a stronger correlation with our results than the development of any channel within the category or across categories. In aggregate, our market shares in e-commerce are about equal to brick-and-mortar. There are countries where it\u2019s lower. There are countries where it\u2019s higher. There are categories where it\u2019s lower. There are categories where it\u2019s higher. And the same is true generally for margin. So all that put together wouldn\u2019t necessarily indicate that were preferenced by the development of one channel versus the other. And of course, you also get into \u2013 increasingly, we should be talking about digital commerce. And that is, as someone mentioned earlier on the call, just as important for Walmart or Target as it is for Amazon or Alibaba. So when we think about channel differences, that historically, in the past, was a customer difference. That\u2019s no longer the case. So there is a blending that\u2019s occurring as well. But we are very comfortable and, in fact, encouraged by the development of digital commerce in general across all of those forms. We feel we\u2019re well positioned. Andre mentioned some of the reasons earlier. I have talked ad nauseam about how this is actually a limited assortment environment as opposed to an unlimited assortment environment and as a result, how the barriers to entry can be even higher for non leading brands in some of these channels. But we want to be available, relevant, super attractive, wherever consumers want to shop, and if it happens to be more digital commerce, we\u2019re prepared to serve.\nJon Moeller: So I think that\u2019s \u2013 yes, I want to thank everybody for your time. I really do feel we\u2019re in a good place, albeit with challenges, as we\u2019ve talked in this call. Again, I go to \u2013 let me just quickly go through one dynamic. We talked about how \u2013 the biggest question that I get is, what\u2019s this all going to look like post COVID. And I look at just a couple of things as indicators of that. I don\u2019t have the full answer. But if we go back to a COVID-normalized, non-affected environment, so how are we growing pre-COVID? We were growing the top line at about 6%. We were growing the bottom line high singles. So, very strong momentum with the current strategy and a portfolio of leading brands and daily use categories for performance stage franchise and a very effective, highly competent organization executing against that strategy. All of that has carried forward into COVID and has built momentum. So fiscal year-to-date, as we were talking earlier, organic sales up 7% core earnings per share up 14%. And if we flash forward to a transition to post COVID normal, whatever that looks like. I would just point to two data points. Our two largest markets, the U.S. is arguably beginning the transition to a new normal; China has arguably transitioned to a new level or closer to that than most other large countries. In the U.S., in the last quarter, we grew 7% on the top line. In China in the last quarter, we grew 22% on the top line, albeit against a base that was partly lockdown-affected. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, we\u2019re up 12%. We are also importantly globally, on an aggregate basis, building share. And none of that is to brag, and none of that is to guarantee future success. But as I look at that combination of data, it\u2019s hard to believe that those same strategies, brands, people that delivered success pre-COVID and during COVID are all of a sudden not going to be delivering attractive results. And that\u2019s our commitment and our plan. With that, we will let you go. Again, thank you very, very much for your time this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Let me quickly summarize another strong quarter and then turn it over to Andre to provide additional perspectives. Organic sales were up 4% on the quarter, up 10% two-year stacked. Global market share was up 40 basis points. Fiscal year-to-date through three quarters, organic sales are up 7%. Core earnings per share up 8% on the quarter, up 14% fiscal year-to-date.Free cash flow productivity over 100%. We are on track to deliver the top and bottom line guidance we have raised twice this fiscal. We are increasing estimates for the third time for free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, which Andre will take us through. One more very important highlight, a 10% dividend increase, which we announced last Tuesday. The team has been managing very successfully with priorities I will describe again later through volatility, uncertainty and some extreme challenges. COVID reopening in some markets increased viral spread, renewed lockdown and severe economic impact in others. Some family is growing at very high rates, others essentially shut; FX and commodity volatility; event specific challenges like the blockage of the Suez Canal; transportation demand mismatched with supply; market-specific dynamics impacting operations in countries like Argentina, Myanmar and Lebanon; and a very mild cough cold season. That's just a very quick synopsis of strong top line, bottom line and cash results in a very challenging environment with a huge thanks to our team. For more perspective, Andre? As shared in previous discussions, we have established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority is supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and which are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We have focused our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we have raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category market growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We are continuing to invest in and behind superior offerings. We launched Dawn Powerwash just over a year ago. Its superior formula and unique spray technology provide powerful suds that cut grease on contact. Powerwash has become a welcome addition to consumers' dish care regimen with so many more meals being cooked at home. Powerwash delivered around $150 million in year one sales and was a significant contributor to Dawn's U.S. all outlet market share growth of more than 400 basis points over the period. Pampers Baby Dry in the U.S. took another step forward towards regaining superiority across all vectors. Baby Dry recently launched innovation, providing more absorbency, improved comfort and better leakage protection for dry and healthy skin. Product graphics were refreshed with improved leakage protection queues and packaging was upgraded to introduce the claim number one pediatrician recommended and hypoallergenic with no parabens or latex. Innovation includes improved in-store displays and online messaging to highlight the improved product packaging and communication. It's still very early in the launch as new products and packages just began shipping in the last month and we are now just starting full commercialization. But this initiative represents an important step in reestablishing superiority in the mid-tier on Baby Care. Tide and Ariel are expanding their 2030 brand ambition to focus on decarbonizing laundry at every step, from design, manufacturing and distribution to consumer use and end of life, while maintaining superior cleaning performance. Ariel's new campaign, Every Degree Makes a Difference, advocates lower washing temperatures, up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in washing machines. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can all do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To do this, we continue to innovate to ensure superior performance in cold water. In China Hair Care, two examples of premium innovation launched in the fast growing conditioner and treatment segments. Pantene Quench Shot masks and 3-Minute Miracle has successfully attracted new consumers to the Pantene brand as well as expanded the regimen of current Pantene shampoo consumers. These innovations have contributed to over 35% market growth in these segments online over the past 12 months. Greater China Hair Care organic sales are up mid-teens fiscal year-to-date and were up 25% this quarter led by conditioners and treatments. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of ongoing productivity. We are driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, following some new demands, seamlessly supporting each other, to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They are reinforced and build on each other. We executed well. They grow markets, which in turn grow share of sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these more recent volatile times that we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. We are optimistic about our crisis prospects and generally like our hand. We will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move through the crisis and quarterly results will not move in a straight line and are more difficult to predict. In many countries, the number of COVID cases unfortunately are the worst they have been. Risk of supply chain disruption remains high. Channel closures will likely continue. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to hold ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With that context, back to Andre to discuss guidance. Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum as I said earlier well before the COVID crisis. We have strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve to heighten needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we have outlined many times and again, this morning and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We are stepping forward, not back. We are doubling down to serve our consumers and our communities. We are doing this in our interest, in the society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. We look forward to talking with you through the quarter and look forward to having David join us on the year end call in July, when we will provide our initial outlook for fiscal \u201822. With that, we will be happy to take questions. Thanks, Dara. First, in comparison to prior cycles, this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we've seen over the period of time that I have been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time. That's not all bad. When commodities move significantly and obviously they affect everyone, including both manufacturer brands and own label retail brands, the industry has pushed to price. When they move modestly, it can be much more difficult in that regard. We are also blessed to have very strong innovation in market and coming to market, which provides an opportunity to price in a value-accretive manner. We define value holistically. And we will be looking \u2013 our overall objective is to cover cost increases. It's important \u2013 and I want to emphasize that, because I didn't say cover or restore margin. It's covering cost increases, which is inherently a little bit margin-dilutive, but we think that strikes the right balance, particularly when we can combine that pricing with innovation and increased perception of value across the portfolio. If we do that well, we should continue to grow markets, and we have talked about the math of growing markets. We do that disproportionately, which is certainly our intention. We will not lose share. We will, in effect, well, necessarily build share. All of that is easy to talk about. All of that is hard to execute. And it's done at a very detailed level by brand, by market. And so it will play out differently across the world. The last very important point on this topic I want to make, if we go back to large commodity cost increase cycles in the past, this company had not yet fully embedded productivity into its mindset and activity system, and that will be a significant part of this endeavor going forward as well. And we feel good about opportunities to continue to increase productivity to help us manage this situation. Thank you, Wendy. Many of these markets do indeed represent significant challenges, and I think it's important we talk about that a little bit. So, that's why I appreciate the question. The health situation in markets like India, Brazil, Turkey is worse than it's ever been. The number of new cases, the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths, unfortunately, was higher in the last week and over the weekend than has ever been the case. These markets do not have the healthcare infrastructure nor the financial means to provide subsidies to their citizenry. And as a result, when this happens, employment is affected. Consumption is affected. GDP is down significantly in some of these markets. No better time to help and to serve our consumers at a time of real need. We need to do that in a profitable way. And frankly, we, knock on wood, have never been more profitable in enterprise markets than we are as we sit here conversing today. So, the operational discipline that's required is significant. We will have to make choices, but I fully expect, to the main point of your question, that these will be markets that will continue to offer top and bottom line growth opportunities for our company. Steve, let me briefly address family, and then I am going to ask Andre to comment on Baby Care since U.S. Baby Care was the business that he led most recently. He is still very close to what's happening there. We are pricing in the three categories that you mentioned because that's where the commodity costs are \u2013 the increases are the more significant. It's really that simple. From a Family Care standpoint, demand continues to be strong. We grew Family Care 5% in the quarter that we just completed. That's even despite some reduction in household pantry inventory. But the usage at home continues to be above pre-COVID levels, and we are managing the balance between home inventory, store inventory and our own production very, very carefully. But the price increases for the near-term are going to be focused, as you rightly mentioned, in baby, family and adult incontinence, the largest of those is baby. I will ask Andre to comment on that. Let me make just a few overarching comments, Lauren, and then have Andre talk about the income statement \u2013 leverage and the top-line growth leverage that you asked about. And the first overarching comment I want to make is we are literally just beginning to put together plans for \u201822. So, I apologize, but we really don't have anything terribly intelligent or cohesive to talk about that. I do not expect, however, our priorities to change. I do not expect our strategy to change. I do not expect our business model to change. But the specifics of that are early in their development, and we look forward to talking to you about that, along with David, in July. I will turn it over to Andre just to talk about the income statement leverage. Of course, that's all in the context of for example, relatively constant commodity costs and no significant impacts from currency, etcetera. Our current outlook for market growth, and again, this changes on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, would be between 3% and 4%, likely rounding to 4%. Our objective is to grow ahead of that by disproportionately contributing to market growth. So, that would put us in the margin square that Andre outlined, again, prior to big impacts from other commodities or currency. Thank you. Why don't I let Andre start on that and I will jump in. We will also continue to the point of your question on a couple of \u2013 previously, to maintain a very healthy investment profile to continue to hold and build our margin of superiority. And we will also continue, obviously, with our strong productivity program, which we will fund by effort. And with that, we are left back where Andre left us. Thank you, Kevin. Pricing is a topic that we are limited in the perspective that we can actually provide relative to specific brands in country and in plans that relate to specific brands and countries. I wouldn't \u2013 I would suggest that we not take that reality and conclude necessarily, but the only categories we are taking pricing in are the ones that have been mentioned. And the only country that we are taking pricing is the one that has been mentioned. This will be a holistic effort with productivity in mind, with innovation in mind. We are \u2013 our business model positions us on a relative basis well to deal with these situations for 2 reasons. One I have just mentioned, which is productivity is part of the culture, part of our DNA. We don't have to start a program. Our program for next year is well underway. The second is an even more important way, is an innovation based business model, which positions us with opportunities to take pricing in a way that's actually value accretive to consumers. And you can imagine that if you have those opportunities and they are spread out across the year, your pricing might be announced at different timing and might take effect at different times throughout the year. I would offer you 1 data point or 2 data points. Pricing has been, and it speaks to the business model point. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top-line \u2013 sorry, a neutral or a positive contributor, but mostly positive to our top-line for 42 quarters out of the last 46 quarters and 15 years out of the last 16 years. That doesn't guarantee anything going forward, but it points to the \u2013 again, the nature of our business model, which provides no guarantees, but does put us in a relatively better position with ways to help the top-line and the bottom-line as we work to manage this and continue to create value. Relative to the question on impact of commodities for next year, as I said earlier, we are really early in the process of putting next year together, couple that with a very volatile, both commodity and FX environment, and I would rather help you with specifics that are meaningful, closer to the beginning of the year. Thanks, Robert. The figures you referenced relative to channel growth are the correct figures as we see them. The growth is significant in both U.S. and China. Both markets have become even more competitive in the e-commerce channel, but I would argue that was true in brick-and-mortar channels as well or global market places becoming more global. And there is strong and healthy competition across channels and markets. The biggest opportunity for us from a superiority standpoint in the e-commerce channel, there are several. But fundamentally, first, second and third is, as you mentioned, superiority. That carries the day in this channel and categories where performance drives brand choice, as much as it does in every other channel. Now we need to scale our offerings in a way that best serve e-commerce and digital commerce consumers. And an example of one of the things we're working on there is packaging, particularly for liquid products, ensuring those products survive the journey to a consumer's home and when she opens box with delight. The conditions that, that bottle travels through are much more strenuous in an e-commerce context, and we need to have packaging that's designed for that in mind. So that's just an example. But the mindset of superiority across everything is the same in that channel as well as any other channels. Andre, I don't know if you have any more perspective on that question from a Baby Care perspective. Encouragingly, in-stock and available on shelf is becoming a very common language for us and our retail partners. It is front and center in the development of our joint business plans, and we have opportunities there, as do our retail partners. And that landscape of opportunities is changing all the time. Andre mentioned click and collect. That presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities as it relates to having products available. We're well positioned in that space, as he mentioned. But this is an area that is receiving a lot of intentional focus both internally and, importantly, in partnership with our retail partners. I think I caught most of that. We're going to refrain from commenting specific pricing moves in any country across any category. That's just a better place to be. Again, we've talked a lot about intent on this call and we've talked about mechanism and method on this call, and I think those are clear. And the rest, we are going to have to stay tuned if available. It also would not make a lot of sense for us to talk about price increases in certain markets and certain categories without having had a discussion with our retail partners. So I'm really \u2013 I apologize, but I said what I could say on pricing, I think it's very constructive in terms of both our intent and our ability to balance that in a way that makes sense for everybody. I will turn it over to our CFO to help you with mix. There is a lot going on within Asia Skin Care. For many of the prestige beauty companies, big parts of their business were severely impacted by COVID. Think about salon-based treatments, offerings that went through specialty beauty channels, which are effectively shut, as an example, travel retail. And as a result, they are smartly investing in a category that continues to offer significant growth, is very profitable and is open, and that is China Skin Care. So, one dynamic that we have happening is a lot of competitive activity. That's not inherently bad. That grows markets. And if you look at, for example, SK-II, we grew SK-II globally strong double digits, over 30% in the quarter that we just completed. Within that, Mainland China, we grew over 50%. Part of that dynamic is something else that's going on, which is the movement of purchase from travel retail and from travel in general, so for example, consumers traveling to Japan to buy prestige beauty products, which they are no longer doing. That purchase that, consumption has not gone away, and that purchase is shifting into the Chinese market, which is feeding significant growth if you report business on a mainland China basis. But it's very encouraging that we're delivering the growth that we are in SK-II. It's been a little bit tougher for Olay, simply because one of the mechanisms that companies are using to compete and take advantage of this opportunity is to reduce prices. And so the gap between Olay and some of the others kind of changes the competitive dynamic. And quite frankly, we need to work to premiumize our lines even more to be fully competitive with some of these brands, which we're in the midst of doing. But overall, beauty grew 7%. Skin and Personal Care grew 7%. Hair Care grew 7%. We've grown organic sales for 22 quarters. It's a business we really like, and SK-II is an important part of it, as is Olay. Well, certainly, a continuation of sales growth rate is important to maintain some level of margin growth rate. And we've been very clear about that from the beginning. I also think that you need to be careful when you think just about commodities in terms of its effect on the gross margin, even on a net basis of pricing because that's not the only thing going on. So for example, there have been significant cost increases associated with COVID in terms of being able to operate safely and successfully that we would expect over some period of time, God willing, as we get through this, both here and in other countries could be an opportunity for productivity and cost reduction. So this \u2013 I've talked about this many times, but there is a chart that I show our leadership team meeting, our team whenever we get together, which simply shows the importance of the combination of sales growth and margin growth and delivering top third TSR. And the simple fact is that if we don't grow margin and we want to deliver top third TSR, we would need to be comfortable sustainably growing sales, organic sales 8% every year. And that's not something that our industry has historically done. It's not something we've historically done, but we remain committed through our innovation programs, through productivity, through the right amount of pricing to continue some level of operating margin growth. I would say that our position as regards superiority, again, in categories where performance drives brand ice and our advantage versus competition in that regard as well as the other vectors of superiority has a stronger correlation with our results than the development of any channel within the category or across categories. In aggregate, our market shares in e-commerce are about equal to brick-and-mortar. There are countries where it's lower. There are countries where it's higher. There are categories where it's lower. There are categories where it's higher. And the same is true generally for margin. So all that put together wouldn't necessarily indicate that were preferenced by the development of one channel versus the other. And of course, you also get into \u2013 increasingly, we should be talking about digital commerce. And that is, as someone mentioned earlier on the call, just as important for Walmart or Target as it is for Amazon or Alibaba. So when we think about channel differences, that historically, in the past, was a customer difference. That's no longer the case. So there is a blending that's occurring as well. But we are very comfortable and, in fact, encouraged by the development of digital commerce in general across all of those forms. We feel we're well positioned. Andre mentioned some of the reasons earlier. I have talked ad nauseam about how this is actually a limited assortment environment as opposed to an unlimited assortment environment and as a result, how the barriers to entry can be even higher for non leading brands in some of these channels. But we want to be available, relevant, super attractive, wherever consumers want to shop, and if it happens to be more digital commerce, we're prepared to serve. So I think that's \u2013 yes, I want to thank everybody for your time. I really do feel we're in a good place, albeit with challenges, as we've talked in this call. Again, I go to \u2013 let me just quickly go through one dynamic. We talked about how \u2013 the biggest question that I get is, what's this all going to look like post COVID. And I look at just a couple of things as indicators of that. I don't have the full answer. But if we go back to a COVID-normalized, non-affected environment, so how are we growing pre-COVID? We were growing the top line at about 6%. We were growing the bottom line high singles. So, very strong momentum with the current strategy and a portfolio of leading brands and daily use categories for performance stage franchise and a very effective, highly competent organization executing against that strategy. All of that has carried forward into COVID and has built momentum. So fiscal year-to-date, as we were talking earlier, organic sales up 7% core earnings per share up 14%. And if we flash forward to a transition to post COVID normal, whatever that looks like. I would just point to two data points. Our two largest markets, the U.S. is arguably beginning the transition to a new normal; China has arguably transitioned to a new level or closer to that than most other large countries. In the U.S., in the last quarter, we grew 7% on the top line. In China in the last quarter, we grew 22% on the top line, albeit against a base that was partly lockdown-affected. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, we're up 12%. We are also importantly globally, on an aggregate basis, building share. And none of that is to brag, and none of that is to guarantee future success. But as I look at that combination of data, it's hard to believe that those same strategies, brands, people that delivered success pre-COVID and during COVID are all of a sudden not going to be delivering attractive results. And that's our commitment and our plan. With that, we will let you go. Again, thank you very, very much for your time this morning."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Jon said, the March quarter was another period of good top line, bottom line and market share growth, along with strong cash generation and strong cash returns to shareowners. Organic sales were up 4% for the quarter, volume in line with year ago, 2 points of pricing, 2 points of positive mix. Organic sales growth was mixed across regions. Overall focus markets grew 5%, with strong growth in our two largest markets: U.S. organic sales, up 7%; and Greater China sales were up 22%. European focus markets were down 2%, largely due to the impact of lockdowns in the region. Japan was down 5%. Enterprise markets were up 1% and were also mixed within the region. Latin America, up 8%; Asia, Middle East, Africa, in line with year ago quarter; and European enterprise markets were down 4%. We delivered strong organic sales growth in most categories: Home Care, up high-teens; Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care, up high singles; Family Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; Fabric Care, up low singles. Feminine Care organic sales were down low singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe, but share trends remained strong in the region and on a global basis. Baby Care was down mid singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe and heightened competitive activity in China. Importantly, Baby Care all outlet value share in the U.S. is up 130 basis points over the past one month and 80 basis points over the past three months. Personal Health Care organic sales were down mid singles, driven by a very weak cold flu season on top of difficult comparisons in the base period. U.S. sales in the respiratory category were down more than 40% in this March quarter versus last year. Despite the weak category trends, Vicks' share was up for the quarter. E-commerce sales were up at about 50% fiscal year-to-date with no notes for change in shopping trends in the quarter. E-comm sales represent 14% of our global sales, aggregate market share growth of 40 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were $1.26, up 8%, currency neutral core EPS also up 8%. Core margin was up 30 basis points, up 80 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin was in line with prior year, up 30 basis points, excluding currency impacts. We generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow with free cash flow productivity at 106%. We returned $5 billion in cash to shareholders, $2 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend, reflecting strong results and confidence in our future. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 131st consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, three quarters into the year, organic sales up 7%, with global value share growing, core EPS, up 14%; ex-FX, up 16%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%, $14 billion of cash returned to shareowners, which is 120% of all-in earnings. Back to you, Jon. So, with three strong quarters behind us and having raised guidance twice across all key metrics we are maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth and core EPS growth for the fiscal year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash returns to shareowners. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. This outlook reflects continued volatility from both base period and current year dynamics, including a challenging fourth quarter base period in the U.S. and in Greater China and continued soft market conditions in Europe and in enterprise markets. Our core earnings per share guidance remains in the range of 8% to 10%. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $150 million after-tax of foreign exchange and now more than $200 million after-tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are now forecast to be a headwind of approximately $125 million after tax. This is a $400 million swing to the negative since our initial guidance for the year with much of this impact affecting our fiscal fourth quarter. As we stand today, our internal estimates for organic sales growth are above the midpoint of the fiscal year guidance range. On the bottom line, we are trending towards the midpoint of the core EPS range. We are again raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% starting the year to now over 100%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook for share repurchase from up to $10 billion to approximately $11 billion. Combined, we plan to return about $19 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. The commodity cost challenges we faced this year will obviously be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that will go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid to high single-digits. As opportunities allow, we will close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers. We are analyzing raw material and foreign exchange impacts in other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. Back to Jon for closing comments. Yes. As you mentioned, I think quarter 3 was significantly impacted due to retailer inventory build in the early phases of the pandemic and Europe focus markets and in the U.S. We expect that to normalize over the next few quarters. Most importantly, the team is really focusing on building irresistible superiority across all vectors in baby, every form and every price tier. And where we do that successfully, we see the results turning. You have heard us talk about U.S. value share being up 130 basis points plus 1. In Europe, where we have also invested in superiority, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, are all up in terms of value share significantly in excess of a point. So, bringing innovation at the same time as we price is the ideal scenario, which we are pushing in the U. S. Now slower growth rates and commodity pressures will continue to be headwinds. So, we need to acknowledge that. So productivity will also be a continued element of that toolbox we have to use to drive growth. But as we focus on superiority, drive market value, we have a business model that works as illustrated in the U. S. and Europe. Yes. So to answer your question, our \u2013 we are growing mid-singles, so call it 3% to 4% on top-line. We have started to see some modest benefit to sales leverage. It really starts to gain traction above 4% growth rate across the income statement, and that's what we have seen, I think in the most recent quarters. So, that's a sweet spot where we want to be. Mid-singles growth allows for sustained margin expansion, which is our growth model that we are going after. Yes. I think overall, I think you are reading it the right way. On the top-line, we see ourselves above the midpoint of the guidance range. On the EPS side, the main drivers, I would call out that will impact the balance of the fiscal year are macro factors. When you think about commodities, we had a 1% EPS headwind in quarter 3. But now we have included $125 million after-tax headwinds for commodities in the guidance. That will largely hit in quarter 4. Foreign exchange rate continues to be a headwind $150 million after tax, which is up $50 million versus what we have talked in our quarter 2 call. And then transportation would be the last element I would mention, at about $200 million after-tax included in the current guidance. Rates continue to be up. Drivers and rigs continue to be in short supply. Sea freight continues to be at a premium. So, we continue to see that pressure mounting and also impacting quarter two. Well, the only other point I would make is I think the strength of our brands is a big effort when you come to e-comm. It ensures that we can be on the landing page in the search top results. I think the strength of our brands also plays to when you think about click and collect, our availability in terms of shells and therefore not being increase up for another Brent when we are out of stock, I think is a big advantage. So our logistics capability, I think, can create value in conjunction with retailers in the supply chain that is driven by e-com. So I think there are many areas of strength that we can apply to make sure we're competitive in that environment. Alright. So from a gross margin perspective, you will have seen, we have about a negative 40 basis points from mix. We're actually being helped by the strong growth that we see in the U.S. and China from a region mix perspective. But you see negative segment mix impact in the quarter mainly driven by faster growth in Home Care and in Appliances and personal healthcare being down on the quarter. I want to call out that negative 40 basis points is not necessarily a negative structurally. Many of our premium propositions in the market come with significantly higher unit sales and unit profit, though with slightly dilutive gross margin mix impact, when you think about, for example, 50% premium on a unit sales basis, 20% higher penny profit, but minus 6% on a margin perspective. So, the same is true for Pampers Pure. When you think about fem care radiant variants, so premiumization, to some degree, carries a margin impact, but we much prefer the penny profit over the margin as we follow that strategy."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-end Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. I\u2019d like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, who will take on Chief Financial Officer responsibilities as of March 1st, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019m going to continue to have overall responsibility for Investor Relations with John\u2019s able leadership and let Andre into our discussions as we move forward. We\u2019re again going to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning, given strong and straight forward results, focusing most of our time on your questions. The strong momentum we\u2019ve created over the past number of years, top-line, bottom-line and cash continued in the October, December quarter, which will enable us to further increase fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, cash productivity and our commitment for cash return to shareowners. We\u2019ve built strong momentum leading up to the COVID crisis. In calendar year \u201819, for example, pre-COVID, we grew organic sales 6%, core earnings per share 15%, and delivered 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This pre-COVID momentum gave us the confidence to continue providing guidance as many eliminated it, and to increase our dividend at the highest rate of many years in April last year, even as we struggled with new COVID realities. Building on that strong momentum, we accelerated organic top-line growth in calendar year 2020, which we just completed to nearly 8%, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increase production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs, strong momentum before COVID and during COVID reflecting the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business. Organic sales up 8% for the quarter, 5 points of volume growth, 1 point of pricing, 2 points of mix, broad-based growth. U.S organic sales up 12%. Past four quarters sequentially for calendar year 2020, plus 10%, plus 19%, plus 16%, now plus 12%. Greater China up 12%. Past four quarters minus 10%, during lockdown plus 14%, plus 12%, now plus 12%. Focus markets up 10%, and enterprise markets, which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic up 3%. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up around 30%, Oral Care and Family Care up double digits, Fabric Care, up high singles. Personal Health Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Grooming up mid singles and Baby Care up low single digits. E-commerce sales up nearly 50% for the first half. Aggregate market share growth [of] [ph] 20 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share of a $1.64, up 15%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 18%. Past four quarters, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%, up 11%, up 22% and up 18% this past quarter. Second quarter core gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, up 200 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 250 basis points, up 310 basis points excluding currency. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 113%. Returning $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $3 billion of stock repurchase. So, halfway through the fiscal year, year-to-date organic sales up 9%, core earnings per share up 17%, ex-currency up 20%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%. $9 billion of cash return to shareowners, 110% of all-in earnings. As we\u2019ve shared previously, we\u2019ve established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First and importantly is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time that we\u2019re all spending at home. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures, which slow the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Our strategies, we focus our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role and brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we raise the bar on all aspects of superiority, products, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term needs to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statements and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, has served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve as well post-crisis. I want to talk a little bit about post-crisis dynamics. While we will undoubtedly experience some volatility, as we move to a new reality, and quarterly results will not move in a straight line, we\u2019re optimistic of our post-crisis prospects and generally like our hand. As consumers spend more time at home due to the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen dynamics play out differently across different categories. More time at home benefits our family, fabric and home care businesses. It negatively impacts grooming, SK-II, deodorants, adult incontinence. So, COVID impacts are different, some positive and some negative across categories. Impacts are also different across regions. While North America market growth has increased, the reverse is true in our Asia, Middle East and Africa region as an example. We\u2019ve suffered disruptions across multiple channels, closures across electro, specialty beauty, away-from-home channels, dental offices. In Japan, department stores still lack beauty consultants, which impacts our premium SK-II business. As I mentioned, our P&G professional away-from-home business has been impacted by low hotel and restaurant occupancy. We\u2019ve seen some supply chain benefits from higher throughput as we simplify the number of SKUs. The costs have increased to source materials, maximize safety, and importantly to transport finished goods. So, as and when we\u2019re out of COVID, we expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should also abate or disappear. And then, there are the mid to long-term impacts of the crisis, which may be accelerators of top and bottom-line growth. The relevance of our categories and consumers lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance, potentially gross, there\u2019s potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to-date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We\u2019re discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today\u2019s necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and the office environment. We very much like our long-term prospects, though the near-term will continue to be challenging and more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. While the first rounds of vaccines have been deployed, the number of COVID cases remain high in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. Despite the launch of vaccines, we'll likely be operating through fiscal '21 much as we have been for the past nine months. In the U.S. and other markets, it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels and how much mitigating economic stimulus will actually be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate. There is a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers. Channel disruptions will likely continue. Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top-line and bottom-line and expect to be highly cash generative. With the strong first half of the base, we're further increasing our fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% going into the fiscal year, to a range of 4% to 5% after the first quarter, now to a range of 5% to 6%. The outlook assumes a quarter-to-quarter step-down in the second half as retail inventories are fully replenished and as category consumption levels moderate. We saw a sequential deceleration in U.S. consumption in our categories in December and January. These trends are incorporated into our new higher guidance range. We're increasing core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7%, the previously 5% to 8%, now to 8% to 10%, a 2.5 point increase at the midpoint of the range. This bottom-line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $100 million after tax of foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $100 million after tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are currently forecast to be neutral to earnings on the year. We will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to about 95% after Q1, now to a range of 95% to 100%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook on share repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion. Combined, a plan to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year, over 125% of all-in earnings. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within the guidance range. Wrapping up, we created strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to midterm, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs, and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. We're happy now to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I wanted to talk a little bit actually about your reference to cleaning, health and hygiene, and long-term category growth. So, first was just closer, and I was curious if you had a view on household pantry inventory, knowing that in some regions there's been still shortages, limited ability to purchase, and this is particularly U.S. conversation. In other markets, you go into a retailer and there is product on shelf and that's obviously gotten better to the pandemic. So, I was curious to get a sense of how much there is in terms of consumer pantry inventory right now of cleaning, particularly surface cleaning product was one? And then, two, just thinking longer term to your reference to change, heightened consumer interest. I mean, how do you think a company like P&G can best address that? Is it occasions? Is it chemistry? Is it packaging? What are sort of the things you're thinking about as you prepare for that future and the ability to kind of capitalize on this heightened consumer interest that you've referred to going forward? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Lauren. We obviously don't have perfect insights into pantry inventories. We know that they're higher, as you indicated, primarily in the U.S. And as you rightly pointed out in many parts of the world, there aren't homes that are large enough to accommodate significant pantry inventory build and there are no pantries. We're also seeing though very, very importantly, increased consumption in these categories, more time at home, more meals at home, higher consumption. In the U.S., as an example, cleaning and sanitizing frequency is up 30%, dishwashing frequency is up 15%, air freshening frequency up 20%; in-home paper towel usage, up 15%. So, while there has been an understandable tendency for some consumers, particularly in the U.S. to build inventory to protect themselves and their family and to minimize trips outside their home, consumption is generally following. Could there be some reduction in top-line growth rates if God-willing the situation gets better, and therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection? Yes, that could occur for some period of time but not in the mid to long term obviously. And those increased levels of consumption are accompanied in many cases by new habit formation or habit strengthening. And unfortunately, we've not been at this for 4 weeks or 8 weeks where things might -- where behavior might snap back to pre-crisis levels. We've been at this on a global basis, even in the U.S. for a year. And that does tend to form habits, which means some higher level of consumption should continue to occur post crisis. And then, while I'm on it, while it's not part of your question, remember again, from our prepared remarks that there are many categories that have suffered as a result of the dynamics we're all managing through. And those should provide an offset in a more normalized environment, the same with markets, the same with channel opening. Heightened consumer interest in health, hygiene and the clean home, what are we doing? The way I like to think about this is how can we step up and step forward to better serve consumers with these heightened needs. Some of that -- and it's all the things that you mentioned. We are innovating and bringing new products to market to better meet those needs, whether that's Microban 24 as an example; whether that's Safeguard sanitizer; whether that is for better oral health as an example, the new IO offering, which has driven a 20% year-to-year increase in our power brush sales. We're modifying packaging, so that it's clearer relative to the health hygiene, clean home benefits that our products offer. We're educating, both to your point on usage occasions and helpful tips around the home. One of our categories that's done a particularly good job on that is our home care category, which has shifted a fair amount of advertising to an educational format, which is designed again to serve consumers during this difficult period. And, our broad brand communication and messaging is generally reflective of those kinds of opportunities. Claims support, developing claims are essentially communication that we can back up with laboratory research that highlights the benefit of our products in many categories to serve these needs. For example, hygiene, that's a benefit as a result of use of some of our laundry offerings. The long answer, but it was a good question. And I want to just reiterate the point again that the question behind the question in all of this I suspect today will be are you -- what kind of shape are you going to come out of this in? And I think, we think we're going to be in great shape coming out of this. I won't predict a top-line growth rate or a bottom-line growth rate that accompanies that, but from a strategy standpoint, from a brand portfolio standpoint, from an organization execution standpoint, and as I mentioned, from the variety of impacts that COVID has had across the portfolio, both categories and geographies and channels, we feel very well-positioned to continue the momentum that we've developed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jon. Congrats on the new role, Andre. Jon, you mentioned the valuation-related pricing a few times in the release today. And I guess, I'm curious if there is a way to quantify the impact of that relative to what, I guess, might be considered underlying price movements in the quarter. As we think about calendar '21 and the setup as we go forward with FX set at the moment to reverse and likely the lapping of some of the COVID promotional pullbacks in 2020, I guess how are you sizing up the prospects of additional net reported price realization as we go forward? Investors are clearly focused on inflationary cost pressures that are building. And I guess the real question is I'm curious as to whether you think those incremental pressures can be offset by cost-justified pricing in the year ahead, or will competition and a return to more normalized promotional patterns make that difficult? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Steve. As you rightly point out, there are a lot of moving pieces within that top-line. From a -- when you put it all together though, price contributed 1 point to the 8 points of top-line growth in the quarter. So, to the extent that everything that's happening, complex as it may be, reverses itself. That has about a 1 point impact on top line growth. Promotion levels, which you've mentioned, have returned from about the lowest point, which was about 17% of products sold on promotion, up to about 26%. So, a significant amount of that promotion return is already in the numbers. And that compares to a pre-crisis range of, call it, averagely 33%. I don't know necessarily where post crisis we're going to net out on that percent, but that gives you that math. The other thing I would point out is that some modest pricing is inherent in our innovation-based and superiority-based business model. Superiority not in terms of price points, but superiority in terms of performance. And if you look at the 1 point sales impact in the quarter we just completed, that's pretty normal. So, we look at -- if you look at the 41 out of the last 45 quarters, pricing has been neutral to a slight positive impact on the top-line, 15 out of the last 16 years. So, if we're going to define an expectation of the future based on normalization, it doesn't look a lot different than what you're seeing now. The drivers may vary and be different by category, by market. But, I think what you're seeing is generally representative of our history and to some extent, representative of the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Jon, you talked last quarter a lot about potential for upside to the range but also downside. And your commentary so far seems to suggest a lot of continuation of the current trends in terms of usage patterns, pricing can continue to be positive. So, when you marry that with the implied second half outlook range, can you just talk through that a little bit? Because it sounds like you're expecting the same dynamic. But, is there any shift in terms of the relative upside-downside to your outlook at this point? Because you do sound pretty optimistic about the post-COVID period. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: The two -- potentially two different questions within there, Olivia. One is the back half; the second is the post-COVID period, which we don't assume occurs in our back half. Let me cover the second one first and then come closer into the back half. When I'm talking about being well-positioned for a post-COVID environment, I'm talking about the mid to long term. I'm talking about the strength of our brands, our strategies and our organization, coupled with what versus pre-COVID will likely be some increase in health, hygiene and clean home consumption of a consumer base that's been through a very difficult and frankly for many of us, life-altering period of time. As we come back in and look at the back half, as I said, we are not assuming the situation changes. And in fact, I've mentioned that I suspect we'll be operating very much as we have for the balance of -- at least the balance of the fiscal year. And I would view the upsides and the downsides in the back half is relatively symmetric. I would view them similar to how I viewed them, how we viewed them when we last spoke. So, that hasn't changed. What's changed is two very strong quarters now in the books, which on a fiscal year basis certainly removes some of that risk and as reflected in our guidance in presses. But, there are just so many things going on in all of our lives and in the world around us, but to assume linearity of any degree is difficult. Think about simple things like rents, like repayment of student loans, like employment, those issues were somewhat offset by stimulus and regulation, for example, in the U.S. in the first half, and it's still unclear exactly what's going to happen to many of those items in the second half. We obviously start getting to higher base periods as we get into the back half as well. And some amount of promotion will move closer off that 26%, closer to something like 30% over some period of time. We'll have to see how that plays out. So again, I think that all the steps we've taken to build momentum in our business pre-COVID have served us very well during COVID, they will continue to serve us well in the back half, and they set us up well for the long term. But, there's a ton of volatility between here and there. Now one way for me to frame that is just think as we were having this conversation last year at this time, and we were trying to prognosticate about what the next six months or the next year would look like. None of us would have had any idea. And if anything, the level of certainty has been -- is less today than it was then. But within that, there are opportunities as well as risks. Sorry for the long-winded answer. I hope that helped a little bit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, Jon. Congrats, Andre. So, I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question. You highlighted your historical ability to take pricing. But I'd argue the commodity spike looks fairly pronounced here, both in terms of magnitude as we saw with your rates for your guidance on freight and commodities. But also, the higher prices appear more sustainable this time around with the post-COVID economic rebound. So, I just wanted to understand your mindset or sort of willingness to take pricing, either maybe shortening the lead time to take pricing or just in terms of level of magnitude relative to the past because it does seem like it's probably a little more of an atypical situation on the commodity front. And then just second, on the other side of it, what's your sense for retailer enthusiasm in the U.S. for pricing in this environment? Obviously, companies like yourselves have posted significant gross margin expansion over the last couple of years, and there is an uncertain consumer outlook. So, do you really need to see that pressure materialize in gross margins before you discuss pricing with retailers? Can you be more proactive? And again, I'm just trying to understand sort of the mindset here around the past when you've typically been able to take price increases and if anything is potentially different this time around.\nJon Moeller: The situation, Dara, is different by category, by market. So, to generalize is difficult, and I apologize for that. But what I would tell you is in general, when your strategy is based on innovation and superiority in categories where superiority drives brand choice, you have more ability to pass on modest cost increases while improving consumer perception of value because they're delivering more performance at the same time. So, at the end of the day, we get ourselves in trouble a little bit when we look at pricing in isolation because that's not how the world works and that's not how the consumer works. That's not how our retail customers think about things either. So, a conversation with a retail customer would involve a whole host of topics with the fundamental question being, do we have a plan together that grows the retailers business and does so in a profitable way. Very rarely do we dissect the conversation to focus on a single variable. That really isn't in either of our interest. Having said all that, is there anything fundamentally different that should -- that I know today that changes materially our ability to deliver the kind of top-line and bottom-line that we have in the past? No.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats again on a strong quarter. Andre, congrats to you as well. I'll pivot away from the topic that you\u2019ll hear on commodities and pricing, Jon, give you a break on that. Longer term question on your online business, which continues to do exceedingly well, now north of 10% of sales. And there seemed to be a false narrative out there probably a year or two ago that the shift to this channel was unfavorable for big brands, which we just really haven't seen, at least broadly in staple. So, as online moves to closer to 20% sales, which would be likely without stretching much in an intermediate term, if you will, using reasonable assumptions, what do you think this will mean for Company sales with respect to market share, margins and returns? And then maybe just comment broadly on risk of private label in this channel. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Kevin. So, as we mentioned earlier and as you referenced, we did have another strong quarter. We've had a strong year-to-date outcome within e-commerce growing 50%, now above 14% of the business globally. So, you're right, it's not far from closing in on that 20% level, particularly with those kind of growth rates. Without going through all the details, you know that I've always viewed this channel and the development of this channel as being big established and preferred brand friendly, not an adverse situation but a conducive situation for growth. We need to perform in this channel against all the vectors of superiority just as we do in the others. But, when we do that, there\u2019s no reason to expect that the outcome isn't as or more attractive than it is in some of the traditional retail channels. If you look at your question about market share and margin, on an aggregate basis today, different by category by country, but on an aggregate basis, our market share in e-commerce broadly defined, so pure-play and omni is slightly higher, not by much than our brick-and-mortar market shares. And I think that's more reflective of the demographics of the online shopper than it is anything else. Our margins are also, on aggregate, similar across the two channels. So, we were in a very nice place that we aim to be in, which is we want to be channel-agnostic, serve shoppers wherever they choose to shop and be able to do that, as you rightly point out, in a way that's neutral to accretive to share margin and return. I think we're very well-positioned, requires work every day, very volatile space. We keep our eye on the consumer and serving them with superior offerings. Again, in categories where performance drives brand choice, we should continue to do well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in and congrats on a very strong quarter and most important, solid execution. I do want to come back to the topic I guess -- and that's pricing and commodity. I think we talked a lot about the pricing outlook, but not a lot about the commodity outlook. Jon, I think your back half guidance implies relatively modest inflation, including freight, because you have 1.5% of COGS back of the envelope, not that substantial. So,, is that a factor of just early on the hedges to contracts haven't hold off, and when they deal, it's going to step up significantly, or is there -- or is the management inflation that we're all talking about somewhat sensationalized?\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Jason. As we said in our prepared remarks, on a total fiscal year basis, the commodity impact to the bottom line is neutral. So, it not one of the things that I'm actually spending a lot of time on and overly focused on relative to some other things. There has been a recent increase in some of our exposures. But, even if you look at -- if you were to take spot rates versus a year ago and annualize that as one evaluation of what the impact could be, it's modest compared to some of the significant commodity spikes that we've been through the last decade. It's also currently offset to a degree by FX. The other thing is that within the total cost pool, there are significant increases reflected in the current results and in the current margin growth for operating in the environment that we've been operating in. And if vaccinations occur broadly and we return more to normality and economies accelerate and therefore put pressure on commodity markets, I would expect that some of these other costs that we've been incurring would abate. So, much like the COVID impact on categories or markets, there are offsets that we have to consider when we look at commodities. And we need to look at the total picture as we think about pricing going forward, which we will do. But again, I mean, we could be having a very different conversation a quarter from now, but at this point, not a huge concern.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Can we shift gears and talk about the enterprise markets a little bit? Because I know you walked through some of the things that have challenged your business in those markets over the last nine months. But, I wasn't totally clear on whether a lot of those pressures are pressures to the category or pressures to your market shares. So, if you can kind of say -- update us on where you think you're competitively positioned in those markets. And Jon, I presume you're going to be spending more time focused on those markets now with your new role, kind of what's your outlook? I know historically, it's been about 20% of sales that region or that lump of regions. I'm sure it's going to be smaller this year given the headwinds you've seen in those markets. But kind of what's your longer-term approach to running that business as you get more focused in on them, that kind of stuff. Thanks so much.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Wendy. Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold. The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the Company to focus on the largest markets and most profitable markets of the Company, what we call, not surprisingly, focused markets. And our progress there has accelerated pretty dramatically. And if that's all we accomplished, that would be a major step forward. So, I just mentioned the U.S. and China both growing 12% in the quarter, both growing double digits year-to-date. I in no way want to assert causality. That would be careless. But, there's certainly nothing to indicate that increased focus in those markets has hurt us. It certainly appears to have helped us. So, that was objective one. Objective two was to ensure -- was ideally for these markets to continue to be a source of top-line growth and a more dependable source of bottom-line growth for the Company by moving management of activity closer to the market, closer to consumers actually in the market with consumers, competitors and customers. And that generally has played out well as well. So, we grew -- the enterprise markets grew top-line; they grew bottom-line last fiscal year. We got to a point at the end of the year where we had two countries within 100 enterprise markets that we're losing money, which is a huge step forward from where we've been historically. And importantly, we did that while holding or building market share. So, this wasn't a cost, if you will, to top-line growth and development relative to the market. In an ideal world, to answer your question about the future, we would continue to enable a strong emphasis of resources on focus markets and manage the enterprise markets in a way that are accretive to Company top-line, accretive to Company bottom-line. And I think in a normalized, post-COVID environment, that's possible. But, we're being very selective in where we choose to win and how we choose to do that. And again, we want to be a source of support for the major markets in the Company, both from the standpoint of enabling focus and from a standpoint of creating financial resource to do that while maintaining an option on the growth that these markets represent in the future. I'd be happy to spend more time. It's obviously a pretty full topic. But in general, we're progressing along the lines that we've set out to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Jon, I thought the context around consumer behavior was very helpful, but I was hoping you can comment on retailer behavior. We've been hearing just generally across the supply chain that retailers are really starting to take seriously assortment -- rationalizing assortment becoming a little bit cleaner in terms of what is on the shelf and how it's displayed. And I would suspect P&G would be in a prime position to benefit from that. So, can you just provide context on kind of what you're seeing and what we should expect as this year unwinds? And I would like to get perspective on the U.S. and maybe some of the international markets to the degree you have that visibility.\nJon Moeller: Our relative position with our retail partners continues to strengthen. COVID has exposed some of, for example, the supply chain weaknesses that exist within the ecosystem that have been supporting those retail partners. In general, we've been a source of dependable supply. There are some clear exceptions where growth has accelerated plus 15%, plus 30%, and we don't build our manufacturing infrastructure for that kind of upside, so. But we're catching up here pretty quickly. But in general, we've been a very dependable source of supply. In general, consumers are shifting to known reputable brands. And obviously, our retail partners are consumer-centric themselves. One of the data that support that conclusion, if you look at private-label data as one example, market shares of private label in our categories are down in the U.S. for any time period you look at in the last 12 months. And we're talking significant -- relatively significant declines of up to a point which on their base is not a small number, and the same general dynamic in Europe. So, retailers are looking to serve the changing needs of their consumers, and we do -- we are well-positioned in that regard. Retailers are looking at their assortment. They're also looking at their inventory levels. And there will be pros and cons within that decision set that occur over time. But again, we're relatively well-positioned. The dynamics obviously differ by market, with some markets that are more challenged even than ours from a COVID standpoint, focused almost exclusively on supply. And again, our supply chain sets us up pretty well to serve those retailers. It's early days. We're still working through as are they, the demand and supply dynamics. But I really think our position has been strengthened as a result of the experience and the response that we've all been working on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Hey. Thank you very much and congratulations on another terrific quarter. So, kind of two related questions, and that is, given your new role that you have and/or shifting of responsibilities, can you talk about what you personally will be more focused on over the next 6 to 12 months, your goals and priorities. And then, perhaps related to that, when we -- kind of looking at the Company, listening to you, looking at the performance seems to be a disconnect between your performance and your outlook and the performance of the stock, which really hasn't done too much over the last 12 months, despite the terrific performance of you and your team. I was wondering if you can perhaps give any sort of sense of where you see the disconnect with investors. And whether over time, it may make sense to be perhaps more aggressive on share buybacks? I know you stepped it up a bit, and it's an impressive. But, based on our analysis, the stock is trading really near 20-year lows versus the market looks extremely cheap to us. You have had problems on the M&A side with Billie. So, maybe in terms of capital allocation long term, more buybacks. Just love to get your thoughts on that issue as well.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Rob. We view our job as focusing on E, earnings delivered in a sustainable holistic way. We view the market's job as focusing on P, and over time, strong E with a strong P, as you know. I'm sorry, I'm being fairly simplistic. In terms of share repurchase and capital return in general, if you go back to the beginning of this fiscal year, our estimated range of share repurchase was $6 billion to $8 billion, and we're now up to $10 billion. So, if you look at the midpoint of the range, 7 to 10, that's almost a 50% increase in our expectation of share repurchase for the current fiscal year. And if you look at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, that's $18 billion, 125% of all-in earnings. We have historically returned more than 100% of all-in earnings in the form of both dividends and share repurchase, I would expect us to continue on that journey. April is the timing in which we would next normally review capital allocation with our Board of Directors, including both dividend and share repurchase. But our belief here, Rob, is very simple. Excess cash is not ours; it's yours or the shareowners and will be, as it has historically been returned to them. In terms of M&A as a part of capital allocation, we've been looking at and executing what have typically been relatively small acquisitions that fill in our portfolio and the categories that we've chosen to compete in, things like Native deodorant, things like This Is L, and then as you know and as you referenced, we looked at Billie within the shave care market. Those things by their size don't, in and of themselves, make much of an impact on our capital allocation choices. So, I don't see any reason today, again this can change tomorrow as well. But as we sit here today, we're pretty committed to the course that we've been on, and I don't see anything that should cause us to run off those tracks. Your question on how I spend my time. So, we're in the middle of transitioning -- Andre and are in the middle of transition, and he'll take over the CFO responsibilities March 1st. I look forward to that, one, because he's incredibly talented, committed and energetic leader; and two, as you rightly point out, that gives me a little bit more capacity to focus on very volatile set of circumstances around the world. I will continue to have Investor Relations responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, from a function standpoint. I'll have responsibility for IT for our global business services, for our sales function, our product supply function, including engineering procurement, manufacturing and distribution. I'll have responsibility -- continue to have responsibility for our market operations around the world. And we'll continue, as you know, to have P&L responsibilities for the 100 or so enterprise markets. So, I've got plenty to do. And I look forward to, as we mentioned, a little bit of additional capacity to focus on each of those items.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, Jon and congrats, Andre. So, my question is on marketing and a follow-up on promotions. So, remember, Jon, you had disclosed back about $15 billion in A&P, advertising and promotion spend on the $67 billion to $68 billion sales base back in fiscal '17. Now it seems you're probably spending a similar amount but in a higher top-line, right around $71 billion, not only obviously because of scale, but also from a digital efficiency perspective. So you think those efficiencies will linger long term? And are you seeing -- on that topic, are you seeing private label passing on potentially the increase in pulp, resin, transportation inflation that would probably lead to a lower gap between you and private label?\nJon Moeller: A strong support for our brands as part of our model and will continue to be part of the model going forward. If you look at the quarter we just completed just in the marketing side of the equation, we increased marketing about 7% year-on-year. I think our levels of support as witnessed by both our share of progress and our top-line progress are appropriate. I would not want to dial those back by any means. But, I expect they'll pretty much move in line with sales with some efficiencies potentially available to us. And pricing versus private label, I really can't conjecture about future price developments, either on our part or their part by regulation. So, I'm going to leave that question alone for now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about margins, Jon, the risk of sounding very high level. I guess, you've seen a lot of risk margin expansion partly due to commodity cost relief. There is obviously productivity in there. SG&A expenses at the same time have remained relatively constant, as a percentage sales, in recent years, partly benefiting from productivity but also sales leverage. I guess, as you kind of think about longer term, I mean, I guess there's lots of puts and takes. But how do you think about your view of sustaining kind of both where they are today and what would be the biggest puts and takes that we should be thinking about in trying to model those going forward and thinking longer term not obviously quarter-to-quarter here?\nJon Moeller: To the extent that we can maintain a reasonable level of top-line growth, we should continue to be able to maintain a reasonable level of margin growth. So, those two are related. I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's kind of the third leg of the strategy, which is productivity and continues to be a very strategic and important endeavor, which contributes to margin, focused on superiority and performance-driven categories facilitates at times margin growth. I mentioned our efforts to improve the profitability within enterprise markets. That has legs to it. So, there is a chart that I share with our leadership team in almost every meeting, which highlights the importance in terms of delivering total shareholder return in the top -- the peer group of both top line growth and margin and illustrates how it's difficult to get home without both. That will continue to be our mindset. The drivers will be different depending on the time period. We are not talking about huge increases in margin. We're talking about modest increases in margin that are correlated with our ability to grow the top line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: So, as you drill down on two segments, I mean, first on Grooming, trends are of course quite strong. But, it looks like the volumes really are starting to take off in a meaningful way. Can you maybe discuss the degree to which that shifts how you're thinking about the growth of the returns in this business model that means for a long time on this kind of reason to believe it and still is -- I know this is -- something's emerging in there? And then secondarily, on Oral Care, I think it is two quarters in a row now you've been up double digits. Obviously Oral Care is one of the segments that kind of disproportionally benefited from folks being at home and such. So, can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing there as categories and just share gains? That's all. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Both categories are benefiting from strong innovation. There's clearly a benefit within the Grooming segment related to more jobs done at home, which is benefit in the appliance side of the business. But overall, the innovation profile in that category and the Oral Care category are what are driving our top line results. I mentioned the introduction of Oral-B iO and the 20% growth in power brush, that's -- we witnessed year-to-date as a result of that introduction, which continues to be very strong. On the Grooming side of the business, whether it's our offerings for sensitive skin, whether it's our new beard care line under the King C. Gillette name, all of those are enabling us to step up, step forward, better serve consumers with all of their needs in that category, and that's reflected in the top-line results that you see.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Jon, can you just comment on the -- or expand a bit on the deceleration that you're seeing in your categories that you noted in December and January? I mean the data did suggest that November saw some stock up on another COVID scare. You think December specifically reflects some get back from that stock up, or does this look like a more sustainable step change in trend going forward? And then, maybe I missed it, but which of the regions in which you're seeing this deceleration in the past several months?\nJon Moeller: That reference was primarily a U.S. reference, though there's some similar dynamic in Europe. And remember -- so in terms of drivers, you're absolutely right on there being some impact from the November stock up. Also remember that consumer situation has changed measurably from, call it October through to December and then January in terms of the amount of stimulus that was available, the lockdown situations in different parts of the world, the employment situation, all of which can reverse themselves fairly quickly, both from a policy standpoint and hopefully, from a human health standpoint. So, I'm not looking at any of that as a foregone conclusion either for the rest of the year or for the future. But, it's important, particularly when we have a quarter as strong as it is, to be holistic in our explanation of what's happening. So, thanks everybody, thanks for your time on what I know is a very busy day. And John and his team will be available on the balance of the day as well of course I to answer any additional questions that you have. Thanks again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. I'd like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, who will take on Chief Financial Officer responsibilities as of March 1st, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm going to continue to have overall responsibility for Investor Relations with John's able leadership and let Andre into our discussions as we move forward. We're again going to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning, given strong and straight forward results, focusing most of our time on your questions. The strong momentum we've created over the past number of years, top-line, bottom-line and cash continued in the October, December quarter, which will enable us to further increase fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, cash productivity and our commitment for cash return to shareowners. We've built strong momentum leading up to the COVID crisis. In calendar year \u201819, for example, pre-COVID, we grew organic sales 6%, core earnings per share 15%, and delivered 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This pre-COVID momentum gave us the confidence to continue providing guidance as many eliminated it, and to increase our dividend at the highest rate of many years in April last year, even as we struggled with new COVID realities. Building on that strong momentum, we accelerated organic top-line growth in calendar year 2020, which we just completed to nearly 8%, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increase production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs, strong momentum before COVID and during COVID reflecting the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business. Organic sales up 8% for the quarter, 5 points of volume growth, 1 point of pricing, 2 points of mix, broad-based growth. U.S organic sales up 12%. Past four quarters sequentially for calendar year 2020, plus 10%, plus 19%, plus 16%, now plus 12%. Greater China up 12%. Past four quarters minus 10%, during lockdown plus 14%, plus 12%, now plus 12%. Focus markets up 10%, and enterprise markets, which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic up 3%. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up around 30%, Oral Care and Family Care up double digits, Fabric Care, up high singles. Personal Health Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Grooming up mid singles and Baby Care up low single digits. E-commerce sales up nearly 50% for the first half. Aggregate market share growth [of] [ph] 20 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share of a $1.64, up 15%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 18%. Past four quarters, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%, up 11%, up 22% and up 18% this past quarter. Second quarter core gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, up 200 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 250 basis points, up 310 basis points excluding currency. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 113%. Returning $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $3 billion of stock repurchase. So, halfway through the fiscal year, year-to-date organic sales up 9%, core earnings per share up 17%, ex-currency up 20%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%. $9 billion of cash return to shareowners, 110% of all-in earnings. As we've shared previously, we've established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First and importantly is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time that we're all spending at home. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures, which slow the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Our strategies, we focus our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role and brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we raise the bar on all aspects of superiority, products, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term needs to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statements and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, has served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve as well post-crisis. I want to talk a little bit about post-crisis dynamics. While we will undoubtedly experience some volatility, as we move to a new reality, and quarterly results will not move in a straight line, we're optimistic of our post-crisis prospects and generally like our hand. As consumers spend more time at home due to the pandemic, we've seen dynamics play out differently across different categories. More time at home benefits our family, fabric and home care businesses. It negatively impacts grooming, SK-II, deodorants, adult incontinence. So, COVID impacts are different, some positive and some negative across categories. Impacts are also different across regions. While North America market growth has increased, the reverse is true in our Asia, Middle East and Africa region as an example. We've suffered disruptions across multiple channels, closures across electro, specialty beauty, away-from-home channels, dental offices. In Japan, department stores still lack beauty consultants, which impacts our premium SK-II business. As I mentioned, our P&G professional away-from-home business has been impacted by low hotel and restaurant occupancy. We've seen some supply chain benefits from higher throughput as we simplify the number of SKUs. The costs have increased to source materials, maximize safety, and importantly to transport finished goods. So, as and when we're out of COVID, we expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should also abate or disappear. And then, there are the mid to long-term impacts of the crisis, which may be accelerators of top and bottom-line growth. The relevance of our categories and consumers lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance, potentially gross, there's potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to-date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We're discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and the office environment. We very much like our long-term prospects, though the near-term will continue to be challenging and more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. While the first rounds of vaccines have been deployed, the number of COVID cases remain high in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. Despite the launch of vaccines, we'll likely be operating through fiscal '21 much as we have been for the past nine months. In the U.S. and other markets, it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels and how much mitigating economic stimulus will actually be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate. There is a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers. Channel disruptions will likely continue. Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top-line and bottom-line and expect to be highly cash generative. With the strong first half of the base, we're further increasing our fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% going into the fiscal year, to a range of 4% to 5% after the first quarter, now to a range of 5% to 6%. The outlook assumes a quarter-to-quarter step-down in the second half as retail inventories are fully replenished and as category consumption levels moderate. We saw a sequential deceleration in U.S. consumption in our categories in December and January. These trends are incorporated into our new higher guidance range. We're increasing core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7%, the previously 5% to 8%, now to 8% to 10%, a 2.5 point increase at the midpoint of the range. This bottom-line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $100 million after tax of foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $100 million after tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are currently forecast to be neutral to earnings on the year. We will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to about 95% after Q1, now to a range of 95% to 100%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook on share repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion. Combined, a plan to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year, over 125% of all-in earnings. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within the guidance range. Wrapping up, we created strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to midterm, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs, and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. We're happy now to take your questions. Thanks, Lauren. We obviously don't have perfect insights into pantry inventories. We know that they're higher, as you indicated, primarily in the U.S. And as you rightly pointed out in many parts of the world, there aren't homes that are large enough to accommodate significant pantry inventory build and there are no pantries. We're also seeing though very, very importantly, increased consumption in these categories, more time at home, more meals at home, higher consumption. In the U.S., as an example, cleaning and sanitizing frequency is up 30%, dishwashing frequency is up 15%, air freshening frequency up 20%; in-home paper towel usage, up 15%. So, while there has been an understandable tendency for some consumers, particularly in the U.S. to build inventory to protect themselves and their family and to minimize trips outside their home, consumption is generally following. Could there be some reduction in top-line growth rates if God-willing the situation gets better, and therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection? Yes, that could occur for some period of time but not in the mid to long term obviously. And those increased levels of consumption are accompanied in many cases by new habit formation or habit strengthening. And unfortunately, we've not been at this for 4 weeks or 8 weeks where things might -- where behavior might snap back to pre-crisis levels. We've been at this on a global basis, even in the U.S. for a year. And that does tend to form habits, which means some higher level of consumption should continue to occur post crisis. And then, while I'm on it, while it's not part of your question, remember again, from our prepared remarks that there are many categories that have suffered as a result of the dynamics we're all managing through. And those should provide an offset in a more normalized environment, the same with markets, the same with channel opening. Heightened consumer interest in health, hygiene and the clean home, what are we doing? The way I like to think about this is how can we step up and step forward to better serve consumers with these heightened needs. Some of that -- and it's all the things that you mentioned. We are innovating and bringing new products to market to better meet those needs, whether that's Microban 24 as an example; whether that's Safeguard sanitizer; whether that is for better oral health as an example, the new IO offering, which has driven a 20% year-to-year increase in our power brush sales. We're modifying packaging, so that it's clearer relative to the health hygiene, clean home benefits that our products offer. We're educating, both to your point on usage occasions and helpful tips around the home. One of our categories that's done a particularly good job on that is our home care category, which has shifted a fair amount of advertising to an educational format, which is designed again to serve consumers during this difficult period. And, our broad brand communication and messaging is generally reflective of those kinds of opportunities. Claims support, developing claims are essentially communication that we can back up with laboratory research that highlights the benefit of our products in many categories to serve these needs. For example, hygiene, that's a benefit as a result of use of some of our laundry offerings. The long answer, but it was a good question. And I want to just reiterate the point again that the question behind the question in all of this I suspect today will be are you -- what kind of shape are you going to come out of this in? And I think, we think we're going to be in great shape coming out of this. I won't predict a top-line growth rate or a bottom-line growth rate that accompanies that, but from a strategy standpoint, from a brand portfolio standpoint, from an organization execution standpoint, and as I mentioned, from the variety of impacts that COVID has had across the portfolio, both categories and geographies and channels, we feel very well-positioned to continue the momentum that we've developed. Thanks, Steve. As you rightly point out, there are a lot of moving pieces within that top-line. From a -- when you put it all together though, price contributed 1 point to the 8 points of top-line growth in the quarter. So, to the extent that everything that's happening, complex as it may be, reverses itself. That has about a 1 point impact on top line growth. Promotion levels, which you've mentioned, have returned from about the lowest point, which was about 17% of products sold on promotion, up to about 26%. So, a significant amount of that promotion return is already in the numbers. And that compares to a pre-crisis range of, call it, averagely 33%. I don't know necessarily where post crisis we're going to net out on that percent, but that gives you that math. The other thing I would point out is that some modest pricing is inherent in our innovation-based and superiority-based business model. Superiority not in terms of price points, but superiority in terms of performance. And if you look at the 1 point sales impact in the quarter we just completed, that's pretty normal. So, we look at -- if you look at the 41 out of the last 45 quarters, pricing has been neutral to a slight positive impact on the top-line, 15 out of the last 16 years. So, if we're going to define an expectation of the future based on normalization, it doesn't look a lot different than what you're seeing now. The drivers may vary and be different by category, by market. But, I think what you're seeing is generally representative of our history and to some extent, representative of the future. The two -- potentially two different questions within there, Olivia. One is the back half; the second is the post-COVID period, which we don't assume occurs in our back half. Let me cover the second one first and then come closer into the back half. When I'm talking about being well-positioned for a post-COVID environment, I'm talking about the mid to long term. I'm talking about the strength of our brands, our strategies and our organization, coupled with what versus pre-COVID will likely be some increase in health, hygiene and clean home consumption of a consumer base that's been through a very difficult and frankly for many of us, life-altering period of time. As we come back in and look at the back half, as I said, we are not assuming the situation changes. And in fact, I've mentioned that I suspect we'll be operating very much as we have for the balance of -- at least the balance of the fiscal year. And I would view the upsides and the downsides in the back half is relatively symmetric. I would view them similar to how I viewed them, how we viewed them when we last spoke. So, that hasn't changed. What's changed is two very strong quarters now in the books, which on a fiscal year basis certainly removes some of that risk and as reflected in our guidance in presses. But, there are just so many things going on in all of our lives and in the world around us, but to assume linearity of any degree is difficult. Think about simple things like rents, like repayment of student loans, like employment, those issues were somewhat offset by stimulus and regulation, for example, in the U.S. in the first half, and it's still unclear exactly what's going to happen to many of those items in the second half. We obviously start getting to higher base periods as we get into the back half as well. And some amount of promotion will move closer off that 26%, closer to something like 30% over some period of time. We'll have to see how that plays out. So again, I think that all the steps we've taken to build momentum in our business pre-COVID have served us very well during COVID, they will continue to serve us well in the back half, and they set us up well for the long term. But, there's a ton of volatility between here and there. Now one way for me to frame that is just think as we were having this conversation last year at this time, and we were trying to prognosticate about what the next six months or the next year would look like. None of us would have had any idea. And if anything, the level of certainty has been -- is less today than it was then. But within that, there are opportunities as well as risks. Sorry for the long-winded answer. I hope that helped a little bit. The situation, Dara, is different by category, by market. So, to generalize is difficult, and I apologize for that. But what I would tell you is in general, when your strategy is based on innovation and superiority in categories where superiority drives brand choice, you have more ability to pass on modest cost increases while improving consumer perception of value because they're delivering more performance at the same time. So, at the end of the day, we get ourselves in trouble a little bit when we look at pricing in isolation because that's not how the world works and that's not how the consumer works. That's not how our retail customers think about things either. So, a conversation with a retail customer would involve a whole host of topics with the fundamental question being, do we have a plan together that grows the retailers business and does so in a profitable way. Very rarely do we dissect the conversation to focus on a single variable. That really isn't in either of our interest. Having said all that, is there anything fundamentally different that should -- that I know today that changes materially our ability to deliver the kind of top-line and bottom-line that we have in the past? No. Thanks, Kevin. So, as we mentioned earlier and as you referenced, we did have another strong quarter. We've had a strong year-to-date outcome within e-commerce growing 50%, now above 14% of the business globally. So, you're right, it's not far from closing in on that 20% level, particularly with those kind of growth rates. Without going through all the details, you know that I've always viewed this channel and the development of this channel as being big established and preferred brand friendly, not an adverse situation but a conducive situation for growth. We need to perform in this channel against all the vectors of superiority just as we do in the others. But, when we do that, there's no reason to expect that the outcome isn't as or more attractive than it is in some of the traditional retail channels. If you look at your question about market share and margin, on an aggregate basis today, different by category by country, but on an aggregate basis, our market share in e-commerce broadly defined, so pure-play and omni is slightly higher, not by much than our brick-and-mortar market shares. And I think that's more reflective of the demographics of the online shopper than it is anything else. Our margins are also, on aggregate, similar across the two channels. So, we were in a very nice place that we aim to be in, which is we want to be channel-agnostic, serve shoppers wherever they choose to shop and be able to do that, as you rightly point out, in a way that's neutral to accretive to share margin and return. I think we're very well-positioned, requires work every day, very volatile space. We keep our eye on the consumer and serving them with superior offerings. Again, in categories where performance drives brand choice, we should continue to do well. Thanks, Jason. As we said in our prepared remarks, on a total fiscal year basis, the commodity impact to the bottom line is neutral. So, it not one of the things that I'm actually spending a lot of time on and overly focused on relative to some other things. There has been a recent increase in some of our exposures. But, even if you look at -- if you were to take spot rates versus a year ago and annualize that as one evaluation of what the impact could be, it's modest compared to some of the significant commodity spikes that we've been through the last decade. It's also currently offset to a degree by FX. The other thing is that within the total cost pool, there are significant increases reflected in the current results and in the current margin growth for operating in the environment that we've been operating in. And if vaccinations occur broadly and we return more to normality and economies accelerate and therefore put pressure on commodity markets, I would expect that some of these other costs that we've been incurring would abate. So, much like the COVID impact on categories or markets, there are offsets that we have to consider when we look at commodities. And we need to look at the total picture as we think about pricing going forward, which we will do. But again, I mean, we could be having a very different conversation a quarter from now, but at this point, not a huge concern. Thanks, Wendy. Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold. The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the Company to focus on the largest markets and most profitable markets of the Company, what we call, not surprisingly, focused markets. And our progress there has accelerated pretty dramatically. And if that's all we accomplished, that would be a major step forward. So, I just mentioned the U.S. and China both growing 12% in the quarter, both growing double digits year-to-date. I in no way want to assert causality. That would be careless. But, there's certainly nothing to indicate that increased focus in those markets has hurt us. It certainly appears to have helped us. So, that was objective one. Objective two was to ensure -- was ideally for these markets to continue to be a source of top-line growth and a more dependable source of bottom-line growth for the Company by moving management of activity closer to the market, closer to consumers actually in the market with consumers, competitors and customers. And that generally has played out well as well. So, we grew -- the enterprise markets grew top-line; they grew bottom-line last fiscal year. We got to a point at the end of the year where we had two countries within 100 enterprise markets that we're losing money, which is a huge step forward from where we've been historically. And importantly, we did that while holding or building market share. So, this wasn't a cost, if you will, to top-line growth and development relative to the market. In an ideal world, to answer your question about the future, we would continue to enable a strong emphasis of resources on focus markets and manage the enterprise markets in a way that are accretive to Company top-line, accretive to Company bottom-line. And I think in a normalized, post-COVID environment, that's possible. But, we're being very selective in where we choose to win and how we choose to do that. And again, we want to be a source of support for the major markets in the Company, both from the standpoint of enabling focus and from a standpoint of creating financial resource to do that while maintaining an option on the growth that these markets represent in the future. I'd be happy to spend more time. It's obviously a pretty full topic. But in general, we're progressing along the lines that we've set out to do. Our relative position with our retail partners continues to strengthen. COVID has exposed some of, for example, the supply chain weaknesses that exist within the ecosystem that have been supporting those retail partners. In general, we've been a source of dependable supply. There are some clear exceptions where growth has accelerated plus 15%, plus 30%, and we don't build our manufacturing infrastructure for that kind of upside, so. But we're catching up here pretty quickly. But in general, we've been a very dependable source of supply. In general, consumers are shifting to known reputable brands. And obviously, our retail partners are consumer-centric themselves. One of the data that support that conclusion, if you look at private-label data as one example, market shares of private label in our categories are down in the U.S. for any time period you look at in the last 12 months. And we're talking significant -- relatively significant declines of up to a point which on their base is not a small number, and the same general dynamic in Europe. So, retailers are looking to serve the changing needs of their consumers, and we do -- we are well-positioned in that regard. Retailers are looking at their assortment. They're also looking at their inventory levels. And there will be pros and cons within that decision set that occur over time. But again, we're relatively well-positioned. The dynamics obviously differ by market, with some markets that are more challenged even than ours from a COVID standpoint, focused almost exclusively on supply. And again, our supply chain sets us up pretty well to serve those retailers. It's early days. We're still working through as are they, the demand and supply dynamics. But I really think our position has been strengthened as a result of the experience and the response that we've all been working on. Thanks, Rob. We view our job as focusing on E, earnings delivered in a sustainable holistic way. We view the market's job as focusing on P, and over time, strong E with a strong P, as you know. I'm sorry, I'm being fairly simplistic. In terms of share repurchase and capital return in general, if you go back to the beginning of this fiscal year, our estimated range of share repurchase was $6 billion to $8 billion, and we're now up to $10 billion. So, if you look at the midpoint of the range, 7 to 10, that's almost a 50% increase in our expectation of share repurchase for the current fiscal year. And if you look at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, that's $18 billion, 125% of all-in earnings. We have historically returned more than 100% of all-in earnings in the form of both dividends and share repurchase, I would expect us to continue on that journey. April is the timing in which we would next normally review capital allocation with our Board of Directors, including both dividend and share repurchase. But our belief here, Rob, is very simple. Excess cash is not ours; it's yours or the shareowners and will be, as it has historically been returned to them. In terms of M&A as a part of capital allocation, we've been looking at and executing what have typically been relatively small acquisitions that fill in our portfolio and the categories that we've chosen to compete in, things like Native deodorant, things like This Is L, and then as you know and as you referenced, we looked at Billie within the shave care market. Those things by their size don't, in and of themselves, make much of an impact on our capital allocation choices. So, I don't see any reason today, again this can change tomorrow as well. But as we sit here today, we're pretty committed to the course that we've been on, and I don't see anything that should cause us to run off those tracks. Your question on how I spend my time. So, we're in the middle of transitioning -- Andre and are in the middle of transition, and he'll take over the CFO responsibilities March 1st. I look forward to that, one, because he's incredibly talented, committed and energetic leader; and two, as you rightly point out, that gives me a little bit more capacity to focus on very volatile set of circumstances around the world. I will continue to have Investor Relations responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, from a function standpoint. I'll have responsibility for IT for our global business services, for our sales function, our product supply function, including engineering procurement, manufacturing and distribution. I'll have responsibility -- continue to have responsibility for our market operations around the world. And we'll continue, as you know, to have P&L responsibilities for the 100 or so enterprise markets. So, I've got plenty to do. And I look forward to, as we mentioned, a little bit of additional capacity to focus on each of those items. A strong support for our brands as part of our model and will continue to be part of the model going forward. If you look at the quarter we just completed just in the marketing side of the equation, we increased marketing about 7% year-on-year. I think our levels of support as witnessed by both our share of progress and our top-line progress are appropriate. I would not want to dial those back by any means. But, I expect they'll pretty much move in line with sales with some efficiencies potentially available to us. And pricing versus private label, I really can't conjecture about future price developments, either on our part or their part by regulation. So, I'm going to leave that question alone for now. To the extent that we can maintain a reasonable level of top-line growth, we should continue to be able to maintain a reasonable level of margin growth. So, those two are related. I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's kind of the third leg of the strategy, which is productivity and continues to be a very strategic and important endeavor, which contributes to margin, focused on superiority and performance-driven categories facilitates at times margin growth. I mentioned our efforts to improve the profitability within enterprise markets. That has legs to it. So, there is a chart that I share with our leadership team in almost every meeting, which highlights the importance in terms of delivering total shareholder return in the top -- the peer group of both top line growth and margin and illustrates how it's difficult to get home without both. That will continue to be our mindset. The drivers will be different depending on the time period. We are not talking about huge increases in margin. We're talking about modest increases in margin that are correlated with our ability to grow the top line. Both categories are benefiting from strong innovation. There's clearly a benefit within the Grooming segment related to more jobs done at home, which is benefit in the appliance side of the business. But overall, the innovation profile in that category and the Oral Care category are what are driving our top line results. I mentioned the introduction of Oral-B iO and the 20% growth in power brush, that's -- we witnessed year-to-date as a result of that introduction, which continues to be very strong. On the Grooming side of the business, whether it's our offerings for sensitive skin, whether it's our new beard care line under the King C. Gillette name, all of those are enabling us to step up, step forward, better serve consumers with all of their needs in that category, and that's reflected in the top-line results that you see. That reference was primarily a U.S. reference, though there's some similar dynamic in Europe. And remember -- so in terms of drivers, you're absolutely right on there being some impact from the November stock up. Also remember that consumer situation has changed measurably from, call it October through to December and then January in terms of the amount of stimulus that was available, the lockdown situations in different parts of the world, the employment situation, all of which can reverse themselves fairly quickly, both from a policy standpoint and hopefully, from a human health standpoint. So, I'm not looking at any of that as a foregone conclusion either for the rest of the year or for the future. But, it's important, particularly when we have a quarter as strong as it is, to be holistic in our explanation of what's happening. So, thanks everybody, thanks for your time on what I know is a very busy day. And John and his team will be available on the balance of the day as well of course I to answer any additional questions that you have. Thanks again."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-end Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller: Good morning. We\u2019d like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. A good quarter isn\u2019t difficult to explain. So, we\u2019re going to keep our prepared remarks brief with just a little over 10 minutes and then turn straight to your questions. July-September quarter provided a very strong start to the fiscal year, enabling us to increase guidance for organic sales growth, raise guidance for core earnings per share growth, increase guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity and raise our commitment for cash return to shareowners, organic sales up more than 9%, 7 points of volume growth, 1 point of positive mix and 1 point of price. We built strong momentum, leading up to the crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019. We maintained 6% growth in the first half of calendar 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increased production, to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And we accelerated to 9% this quarter against a strong 7% base period comparison. Strong momentum reflected the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business, pre, during and at some point post-COVID. Broad-based growth, U.S. organic sales up 16%, Greater China up 12%, focused markets up 11% and enterprise markets which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, up 5%; 9 out of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up more than 30%, Oral Care up mid-teens, Family Care up double-digits, Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care up high singles; Grooming up mid singles, Baby Care down low singles; aggregate market share growth of 30 basis points with 30 of our top 50 country category combinations holding our growing share; e-commerce sales up approximately 50% for the quarter. Turning to earnings, core earnings per share up 19%, currency neutral core earnings per share up 22%. Within this, core gross margin expansion of 140 basis points, up 170 basis points ex-FX. Core operating margin up 300 basis points, up 350 basis points excluding FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95%. We returned $4 billion of value to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $2 billion of P&G stock repurchase. In summary, a very strong start to the fiscal year, strong volume, sales and market share trends, strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and have been able to maintain this through the most recent quarter, supporting a guidance increase for all key financial metrics, organic sales, core earnings per share, cash productivity, and cash return. As we outlined each of the last two quarters, we\u2019ve established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene, and the additional time we\u2019re all spending at home. Third, supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic, with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures as well as the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices which remain the right ones. These strategic choices are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. As you know, we focused our portfolio on daily use products and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we\u2019ve raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and the competitiveness of our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis, and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Next, success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In our current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Last, our new organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we\u2019ve made, portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We believe our strategies, the success we\u2019ve had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and the clean home all bode well for the future. We believe P&G is well-positioned to serve consumers\u2019 heightened needs and their changing behaviors, and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value-creation. We like our long-term prospects, though the near term will continue to be challenging, and it\u2019s a little more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources infrastructure, or in some cases the will to effectively manage it. We\u2019ll likely be operating without broadly available vaccines or advanced therapeutic through fiscal \u201821. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world. In the U.S., it\u2019s unclear how long we\u2019ll be operating at high unemployment levels, and when and how much mitigating economic stimulus will be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate and there is an ongoing risk of supply chain disruption, our operations or those of our suppliers. Against this challenging backdrop, we\u2019re still holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With a strong first quarter as a base, we\u2019re increasing our fiscal year guidance. We\u2019re raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%, which includes some quarter-to-quarter ramp-down from Q1 as retail inventories are fully replenished and as promotions are partially reestablished. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year. We\u2019re increasing our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7% to a range of 5% to 8% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $325 million after tax, a foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $50 million after tax of higher freight costs. These headwinds should be partially offset by $175 million after tax of commodity costs tailwinds. Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We\u2019re raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to around 95%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $9 billion. Combined, dividends and share repurchase are planned to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, current commodity prices and current foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Wrapping up, we continue to execute winning strategies, a portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority in products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organization focus, agility and accountability. We feel we continue to have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the Company\u2019s facing, ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing product availability, and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We\u2019re stepping forward, not back. We\u2019re doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We\u2019re investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization, always with our eyes fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation. With that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Geez, first question. So, many areas ago. I guess, I wanted to jump off of probably one of the higher order questions, Jon. You mentioned you\u2019re excited, enthused about the consumers\u2019 increased focus on health, hygiene and home. What\u2019s your view on the durability of those related behavioral changes that we\u2019ve seen over the last six, eight, nine months? Do you expect it to mean revert to pre-COVID? If so, what\u2019s the duration? And if not, why not?\nJon Moeller: We do expect that there\u2019s some stickiness to new habits that are being formed, and new awareness that\u2019s been raised. It\u2019s hard for us to see in our interactions with consumers, that we\u2019re going to snap back and revert to the same attitudes and the same behaviors that we had collectively pre-COVID. Even things like the amount of inventory, pantry inventory I keep. In some ways, this is analogous that some of us remember our grandparents, for example, having survived the great depression, and they continued to hold on some more food and canned items that I could ever understand. But, it was because of what they\u2019ve been through. Consumer habits, once they\u2019re established in our categories are rarely reversed. On occasion, under duress, they will be. But generally, once people start using a category, once they form a habit, it\u2019s phase. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some level of reversion. But, we do expect a permanent change at some level as well. Duration, your call is as good as mine. I have no ability to predict what\u2019s going to happen here from a viral standpoint or from a medical solution standpoint.\nJason English: I appreciate the perspective. In that context, as you think about your portfolio construct, does it change the way you think about where you want to play?\nJon Moeller: On the margin, it can have an impact on where we want to play. We\u2019re happy with each of our current categories. The question is, are there additional opportunities that we want to be able to access? So, for example, we launched a hand sanitizer in the U.S. under the Safeguard brand name. You\u2019re aware of the Microban 24 surface disinfectant, which we\u2019re working hard to increase capacity on so we can meet very-high demands for that product. So generally, again, our portfolio is going to daily-use categories, performance drives brand choice, heavily centered on health, hygiene and a clean home is going to serve us very well on the situation, just as it did prior. But, the situation does present additional opportunities to step up and serve and help consumers with their health, hygiene and clean home needs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: So, 7% volume growth, 1 percent price, 1 per cent mix, very balanced. Kind of a two-part question. How are you thinking about market share, how much of a priority is that in this environment? And kind of then, looking at e-commerce, we\u2019ve done a lot of work on the U.S. e-commerce business and did a deep dive on that using numerator data. And what came out of that was a little mixed. Certain categories doing extremely well, like Crest just killing it in e-commerce, but based on the numbers and data we saw diapers, bath tissue, paper towels appear to losing share in e-commerce. So, love to kind of a get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about market share and then particularly market share in e-commerce, and where -- whether in terms of e-commerce whether you are hitting kind of the nodes of superiority that you\u2019re looking for with the rest of your business? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Robert. I want to start in a slightly different place, but I\u2019m going to bring it right around to the core of your question. So, be patient with me. We are maniacally focused on increasing and leading market growth. And when we do that, we do that with superior products, continuously increasing our margin of advantage, meeting additional needs, solve intention points across the portfolio. When we disproportionately are able to drive market growth, mathematically, we build share. And that share growth is much more sustainable achieved that way and is much generally much more profitable than if we were sourcing market share by taking business from other companies. So, we\u2019d rather create than take, and in the process more sustainably build market share, which is very important, as well as sales and profit. In terms of e-commerce, it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace, just like other channels that we compete in. So, there are always ups and downs across categories. But, we find that the same general strategy that I articulated in our prepared remarks and that I just described parts of it and what I just provided is highly relevant in e-commerce, just like it is in brick and mortar. And we don\u2019t see a lot of -- there\u2019s some, but we don\u2019t see a ton of differentiation between our ability to succeed in an e-commerce format and a offline format, when we execute our strategies and when our products in categories where performance drives brand choice are truly superior. So, that\u2019s our focus. We look carefully at overall share progress online versus offline and margin progress online versus offline in an area, which is always dangerous. Of course, operationally, we move to lower levels of aggregation. We\u2019re indifferent between online and offline shopping, which is exactly where we want to be. I mentioned we grew e-commerce sales 50% in the quarter that we just completed. E-commerce sales are now probably 11% to 12% of our total. So, they\u2019re important. And we\u2019re just as focused on being successful in that channel as we are the others.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So, Jon, I just wanted to better understand the implied healthier organic sales growth guidance for the fiscal year after Q1 strength. It\u2019s only about 3% at the endpoint of your full year range versus 9% this quarter, doesn\u2019t seem to really moved up the Q2 through Q4 implied forecast, despite the Q1 upside. So, just trying to understand is that more just related to uncertain environment here post COVID? Are there other specific factors driving that forward sequential caution, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple in your prepared remarks. So, a bit more detail will be helpful there. And just on promotion, given that they come up in your prepared remarks. Is the U.S. promotional environment -- is that returning to more of a normalized level? And how do you think of our calendar 2021 versus 2020 on that front? Just given it was an abnormally depressed promotional base.\nJon Moeller: No surprise to you or anyone on this call, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain environment with many more drivers of that uncertainty than we\u2019re historically accustomed to. And that certainly helps frame guidance, if not guidance ranges. Second, we\u2019ve got a long way to go. So, we\u2019re through one quarter, we\u2019ve got three more quarters to execute on in this very dynamic environment. Third, market growth, which is where we start in our outlook process, looks to be kind of 3% to 4% on a normalized basis. That\u2019s global. And so, 4% to 5%, as our new fiscal year guidance range is consistent with our desire to build market share, but I think realistic in its approach. Also, the quarter we just completed has two elements, and you mentioned one of them that will drive a higher top line result. The first is, there\u2019s been -- there was inventory replenishment to the trade during the quarter that was probably worth a point or two. And you mentioned as well lower levels of promotion. We still have categories where we have replenishment work to do. So, some of that benefit will carry forward into subsequent quarters, but many of our categories are for now replenished. And from a promotion standpoint, we\u2019ve returned to somewhat normal levels of promotion in most categories in the U.S. except those where we still have work to catch up on replenishment, where demand exceeds our ability -- our current ability to supply, and that would be our Home Care business, our tissue/towel business and parts of our Health Care business. We do expect some normalization of promotion rates in the back half of the year. So, as we get into 2021, exactly what the cadence is of that and exactly what level things return to is not entirely clear. We\u2019re going to continue where we have the opportunity to prioritize spend on innovation and equity. There is nothing proprietary in promotion. But, we will be competitive from a promotion standpoint. I know that answer lacks the specificity you are looking for. The best I can do with the current state of a knowledge and the current state of volatility. I think, Dara, the question behind the question is, is there a possible upside to the guidance range? I think the answer is yes. But, I would also hasten to add that there\u2019s also downside. There is just a lot of moving pieces right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to ask a little bit about fields of play. As you\u2019ve mentioned, kind of new opportunities out there and in the release also had specifically mentioned the Safeguard launch. I was curious though also about the Personal Health Care business because that\u2019s another area where, just like Home Care, you\u2019ve been investing in sort of building up a greater presence pre-COVID. And it would seem that this new environment would also open up some interesting incremental opportunities in Personal Health Care. So, could you just talk a little bit about that business, kind of where -- if you are spending differently, focusing on new areas, what the more international footprint of that business opens up for you versus where you were several years ago? I think, that could be really helpful.\nJon Moeller: Sure, Lauren. That is a -- Personal Health Care is a very attractive field of play, to use your description. It\u2019s one that, you are right, we\u2019ve been investing behind. We purchased the German Merck OTC portfolio, which we\u2019re still in the middle of integrating, but very successfully. Our top-line growth on that business and our heritage P&G Personal Health Care business outside the United States, to your question of international, is growing at growth rates -- very attractive growth rates, high singles, double digits in some cases, ahead of the plan when we purchased those assets. And the good news is, cost synergies are also coming in nicely. So, that does give us confidence to continue looking for smart ideas to expand the current portfolio and to look for additional opportunities to create value with. And we\u2019ll be doing that. The German Merck OTC assets gave us about $1 billion sales international business, again, combined with things like Vicks and the heritage P&G portfolio. So, we now have a meaningful presence in many parts of the world that puts us -- and we\u2019ve secured capabilities that put us in a position to drive this business and do it profitably. And that will be one of our focus areas going forward. Though I don\u2019t want to overemphasize that opportunity, we have, as you know, spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to land in the 10 categories that we\u2019ve landed in. And our intention is to grow and to win and to seize opportunities and to do it profitably in each of them. But clearly, we see those same opportunities in the over-the-counter medicines business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Jon, you\u2019ve had a couple of tremendous growth quarters in the U.S. as well as China the past six months, and you\u2019ve hinted at it a little bit this morning already. But, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more explicitly around your expectations for those markets over the remainder of the year, both in terms of consumer takeaway as well as your own selling patterns, if they\u2019re likely to differ. And I guess I don\u2019t know if you consider this a separate question, but I guess, I\u2019m curious as to what you attribute that outstanding growth to in those markets versus what I think equates to more like low to mid single digit growth across the rest of the portfolio. And I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s just a focus of -- it\u2019s just a function of your particular focus or if there are underlying differences that are more structural in those most focused of your focused markets, versus the rest of world as we think about the go forward.\nJon Moeller: We\u2019ve talked for some time. David began talking about this at CAGNY several years ago, about the importance of winning in the U.S. and China. And we\u2019ve been very intentional in establishing superior positions across our categories in those two markets. Even our organization design is structured to allow our -- the leadership of our Company to focus their time and effort on the focus markets with, as you say, China and U.S. being the most focused of the focused markets. And the combination of that organization choice, that prioritization choice and the execution of holistic strategy are what are making the difference in the U.S. and in China. The U.S. and China, from a category growth standpoint do have category growth rates that are higher on average than some other parts of the world. I take Europe as an example; currently, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa, as an example. But, I don\u2019t think that that is -- I mean, there is significant opportunity across the geographic portfolio, witnessed in the quarter we just completed, we grew organic sales and we grew earnings in every geographic segment. So, as we fully and holistically execute the strategy on a global basis, there should be opportunity to improve growth rates in the non-U.S. and non-China business. And we\u2019re going to have to work really hard to maintain strong growth rates in the U.S. and China, where we have very strong and able competition. The growth rates that we delivered most recently are very strong, very attractive. They were pre-COVID. They were certainly in the U.S. during covert, not so much in China. And the rebound in China has been encouraging to see. But, I think, from a sustainable standpoint, and we talked about this at Lauren\u2019s conference in the fall, earlier in the fall, you need to really start with what you expect market growth to be and assume we can build a couple of share points or a little bit of share on top of that to really ground yourself on what\u2019s reasonable to deliver over longer periods of time. Now, as I said earlier in this conversation, we have a responsibility to impact that market growth, and we believe we\u2019ve done that certainly in the U.S., and we need to continue doing that. Very long-winded question, but the disproportionate growth in the U.S. and China is partly a function of those markets. It\u2019s partly a function of priority. It\u2019s partly a function of the execution of the strategy, and I think it has -- it\u2019s already had application elsewhere and will continue to even more so, as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning, Jon. And congrats again on another great quarter. First, a housekeeping question. I apologize if I missed this. Do you have a global retail takeaway number relative to the 9% organic sales growth in the quarter? That would be helpful. So, my broader question, Jon, is on the U.S. men\u2019s grooming category. I was hoping to get an update there. And I ask, of course, in the context some of the challenges, some of the demand challenges that that business has faced for a while, which has been compounded a bit by the pandemic and work-from-home trends. And now, I also think it\u2019s notable that the Dollar Shave is rolling out at Walmart just this week. It probably suggests further risk to shave may slow some of this [ph] momentum. But, can you comment a bit on the potential risk to Gillette\u2019s market share position, spending plans that are in place? We talked about promotion early. I suspect this will likely be a category or a destination for some of their higher promotion, particularly in the competitive environment and some of the demand challenges. And maybe just comment on your level of comfort around pricing ladders and price positions in the category, which I know has been an area of emphasis here in recent years.\nJon Moeller: I\u2019m going to suggest you get with John Chevalier after the call. He can give you a more specific number on retail offtake during the quarter. Going at it kind of from the top of my head, I would guess it\u2019s probably 7 or 8, but John can help you with that. In terms of Grooming, Grooming continues to be a very attractive business. We grew the top-line on our Grooming business globally two years ago. We grew it last year, so two years in a row of growth. And we grew at 6% in the quarter that we just completed. Part of that -- part of the pickup in the business is a result of a more holistically serving all consumers. So, we\u2019ve talked about SkinGuard as an example that was designed to meet the needs of a high percentage of men who had sensitive skin, for whom shaving was painful, and reduced that barrier to shave frequency and shaving in general. We launched now in some channels and in some parts of the world, a whole lineup of products under the brand of King C. Gillette that are designed to serve men who choose to maintain facial hair, so everything from trimmers to beard wax to conditioners, et cetera, and that has been going very, very well. And the third thing I would point to is very strong innovation on our dry shave business, which grew -- has been growing very attractively as well. This will continue to be a competitive category because of the attractiveness of the category. You should assume that that is built into our thinking and built into our plans. And I want to avoid any specific reference to pricing or promotion in a specific category of business. But, we are -- we like this business. It\u2019s growing. It\u2019s very profitable, highly cash-generative, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be investing behind.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Congrats on your results. Jon, if you could break down your 7% volume growth in additional distribution and innovation against just a lot you have of the legacy franchises, just to get an idea of the duration of this momentum. And conversely, perhaps the only area that you may need to improve are the mid-tier diapers. So, can you give us your view on this segment globally?\nJon Moeller: I really don\u2019t know how to break volume down with any confidence along the lines that you\u2019re requesting. So, I apologize for that. We have some great positions in diapers around the world, particularly in the pant style form, where we\u2019re market leaders, and that is the fastest-growing segment of the diaper market on a global basis. We\u2019re also doing very well in the premium portion of the business. As you rightly point out, we have not been superior in the middle of the market, what we call mainline. And we have, as you would expect, been working hard on that and have innovation coming to market across the world, beginning this quarter and next, and carrying on through 2021, which we expect to address that situation.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Jon, I wanted to go back to e-commerce, so 11%, 12% of sales. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s somewhere kind of doubled where it was pre-COVID. So, maybe touch on how much of that increase is sustainable? I mean, how much of those consumers are going to continue to purchase in that medium? And what drives the adoption of those consumers to maintain that presence on a go-forward basis? And the things that you\u2019ve seen, maybe all have on our own working kind of see that that will continue and curious how you all are thinking about it? And sort of related to that and under any circumstances, would you pursue more DTC, things like SK-II even broadly? I think that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: We want to serve consumers in a superior fashion wherever they choose to shop. And that\u2019s really our focus. So, we\u2019re not focused on one channel versus another. We prefer to be channel-agnostic and let the consumer make that choice. And as long as we\u2019re very well-positioned with a superior product, a superior package that\u2019s relevant for the channel, communication that\u2019s relevant to the channel and have the right value, if they choose to shop in e-commerce, we\u2019ll win. If they choose to shop in brick-and-mortar, we\u2019ll win. If they choose a hybrid shopping experience like click and collect, if we\u2019re appropriately positioned, we should do very well. So, that\u2019s our focus vis-\u00e0-vis any specific channel focus. Within that, DTC clearly can play a role. As you mentioned, in some of our businesses, it\u2019s already a significant part of the operating model. It\u2019s -- it allows us to get closer to consumers to understand, to have an even better understanding of their needs and their habits, including their purchase habits, and that all can be very complementary and important in the broader context. So, you will see us continue to increase our DTC presence, but again, not at the preference of -- or the de-prioritization of any other channel of trade.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: I want to talk broadly about the competitive dynamics, because clearly, we\u2019re innovating, gaining share. Your plans from earlier this year to double down on investment is working. So, what\u2019s your view on competition at this point? Because, they\u2019ve also talked about picking up the pace in their activity, have you seen it? And it\u2019s perhaps just not quite landing how they had anticipated, or is there more to come from competition that\u2019s factored into the full year sales expectations? And maybe where you\u2019re most concerned, because you talked about still catching up to demand in a couple of categories, Family Care, Home Care, some Health Care and newer growth in the non-COVID categories, like Beauty, Grooming, and Health Care has really started to accelerate. So, I would love a little bit more color on that. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: I\u2019m going to start where you ended, Olivia, and then I\u2019ll come back to competition. The strong quarters that we\u2019ve been putting together are a reflection of our brand portfolio and our strategies, which built momentum for the business prior to COVID, have maintained momentum through COVID and allowed us to accelerate in the quarter that we just completed. These are a set of strategies in an activity system that were well suited to the pre-COVID environment, as we saw reflected in our results; are very well suited to the COVID environment, as you see reflected in our results; and we expect will be very well suited to someday a post-COVID environment. And that set of strategies and importantly the execution behind them on the part of 99,000 P&G men and women around the world is what\u2019s driving, as you rightly point to, growth on the top-line and the bottom line across each of our franchises. We talked about the challenge we still have in Baby Care and how we\u2019re going to address that. But 9 out of 10 categories grew top-line in the quarter. Each of our geographic regions grew top-line in the quarter, and that\u2019s really reflective of the execution of this integrated set of strategies that we\u2019ve been working on for some time. We feel that is the best insulation against what is certainly a competitive marketplace across the board. I want to be careful though that we don\u2019t react necessarily to competitive statements about spending as inherently inducing risk. Competitive spending that\u2019s constructively structured and that grows -- increases consumer awareness and participation in categories is not a bad thing. So, what\u2019s more important is the how or the what. And we\u2019re early in the execution of some of those competitive agendas, and we\u2019ll see. But, I know for sure that our best chance of continuing our momentum and doing it profitably is to continue to execute the strategy that\u2019s been working for us so well.\nOperator: We\u2019ll next go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Could you talk about your margins? Both, growth and operating have just exploded, and that\u2019s awesome. But, I\u2019m wondering how much of that is structural improvement you\u2019ve made to your organizational structure and all that kind of stuff, and how much of it is just the benefit of favorable operating leverage. So as we think longer term, two years, three years, four years out, have you permanently reset the margin structure for the Company, or do we think those are going to trickle back when top-line growth normalizes a bit? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: So, within the 300 basis points of operating margin improvement, about two-thirds is attributable to sales leverage, which still leaves a healthy third, around 100 basis points. That\u2019s due to the net of savings and productivity and our reinvestment in superiority. So, that\u2019s the breakdown that you\u2019ve asked for. We are very clear in our own minds that on a going basis, we need to grow the top-line and we need to grow margin. So, everything we\u2019re executing is designed to do both, both now and moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Jon, I was wondering if you could just pick up on your thoughts on the economy. And I ask this really because obviously there is a concern that if you do kind of hit them tougher times that there will be a lot of trade down pressure, not just for Procter but for a lot of CPG companies that tend to play into more premium end of the categories. But, I was just wondering what you thought about this whole thesis of income\u2019s bifurcating [ph] or the consumer goods bifurcating because the lower income demographic is getting much more impact due to furloughs and job losses at the kind of lower end of the range spectrum, yet, middle income and higher income consumers are still doing fairly well. So, I was just hoping you could just add some thoughts to that whole thought process.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Nik. I\u2019m not smart enough to know where this all lands. What I can do is look at the data that are available to date. And that\u2019s a fairly encouraging set of data. If we look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, U.S. private label shares in the last three-month period are down 1 full point, which is an acceleration in the decline versus the prior three-month period, and the same dynamic generally holds true in Europe. There is just a heightened need for products that deliver against health, hygiene and clean home concerns and a willingness to spend just a little bit more to ensure that I\u2019m using a product that I know and trust and believe will work for me and for my family. So, in most of our categories, that\u2019s the dynamic that\u2019s playing. Supporting that direction, unlike prior crisis, or very different from prior crisis, is a whole reconfiguration of the consumer budget. They\u2019re not spending money generally on travel, on entertainment, at a meal at a restaurant, on apparel. So, they do have some flexibility. It\u2019s more prevalent now than has been the case historically, which they can redirect and many are redirecting if they choose to do so. Now, I want to be careful here. I\u2019m not suggesting that there isn\u2019t greater economic stress ahead of us or that it won\u2019t have more of an impact than we\u2019ve seen thus far. I just don\u2019t have the ability to predict where that goes or lands. I can only really reflect on what we\u2019ve seen thus far, which is in total, encouraging.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Jon, I know this is going to -- it\u2019s a hard question to answer, and we don\u2019t have the specific details. But, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from investors on how you might be thinking or scenario planning around any changes or really increases in the tax structure, if there\u2019s a change in administration.\nJon Moeller: First of all, any meaningful change in the tax structure at the corporate level in all probability requires a change in the executive branch and control of the Senate. So, that\u2019s the first handicapping that anybody has to do in order to understand whether there\u2019s likely to be change. The second point I would make is, there\u2019s a lot of conversation and rhetoric at the surface of this issue. But, if we go back to why did so many of us push so hard for so long on corporate tax reform, and again, I\u2019m dealing with the corporate piece of this, and why was it eventually enacted. There were some very powerful and important motivators that I don\u2019t think have diminished in their importance. The first was we wanted American companies to be fully competitive in non-American markets, which would give American companies every opportunity to attract capital, to grow, to create jobs, to increase America\u2019s standard of living. The second motivation was to prevent capital flight to make it attractive to be domiciled and headquartered here in America as opposed to moving operations to other parts of the world. And the third, which is closely related to the second, is we wanted to incent capital formation onshore versus offshore. Those are very strong motivators and very important dynamics that I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to casually walk past. So, I just offer that in terms of the amount of thought, deliberation and consideration that I expect will go into any recommended change that to date collectively hasn\u2019t been applied most recently to this question. So, I\u2019m stopping shorter than a specific answer on the numerics. It\u2019s going to be highly dependent on the details of what if anything happens. And that answer is going to be driven by, I think, a lot more reflection on the three questions that I just mentioned as well as some others.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Hey. Two quick ones. One, Jon, just remind us how big dry shave is of total shave. Just I was a little surprised that it could offset the whole business, I mean, even with 30% growth. And then, on the commodity front, can you maybe talk a little bit about what\u2019s changed and what you see on the horizon just since you gave guidance I guess, two and a half months ago to have a little more of a headwind.\nJon Moeller: I understand the question on the breakdown of dry versus wet shave. I don\u2019t have the data. But, if you call John, he can certainly get that for you. The commodity environment, in my way of thinking, hasn\u2019t changed dramatically since we provided guidance for the year. There\u2019s been an increase in pulp, as an example, an increase in some of the other items we purchased. But, overall, it\u2019s a relatively, on a historical basis, benign environment at the moment. Oil and the petro complex is generally somewhat range-bound. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jon Andersen with William Blair.\nJon Andersen: I have two quick questions on mix, first one being, if you could describe the impact of mix on the P&L, whereby it adds to sales, organic sales growth that detracts from gross margin in the quarter. And the second question is the mix benefit you experienced in the quarter and the top line looks to be driven essentially by fabric and Home Care and to a lesser extent Health Care; the balance of the division is neutral. What\u2019s happening within those segments that\u2019s driving favorable mix? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Mix is a very complicated animal because there is not just category mix, but there is geographic mix. And so, for example, when the U.S. grows faster than almost any other market, both with its sales rate or revenue per case and its profitability, that has a significant impact as do the category differences that you referenced. To get to the conundrum of gross margin going one way as it relates to mix and P&L going another way, I\u2019ve talked about this quite a bit. And it\u2019s a reason that I really don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not focused on margins. We\u2019re not focused on margins. I don\u2019t want that to scare anybody because I didn\u2019t say we weren\u2019t focused on profit and cash. But, margins are an interesting animal. I can\u2019t put margins in a bank. I can\u2019t return margins to shareowners. I can\u2019t really invest margins in innovation. What I can do, what we can do is invest profit and cash in each of those things. We can put that in the bank. We can redistribute that to shareholders that we can invest it in increasing our margin of superiority. We have -- many of our premium offerings carry a lower gross margin but a higher penny profit. Laundry unit dose is an example of that dynamic. I\u2019ll take that higher penny profit every day of the week, even though it may degrade our gross margin to some degree. But, that\u2019s the dynamic, the delta between a margin and penny profit that\u2019s driving the math that you\u2019re seeing. And that\u2019s why we can\u2019t get hung up in margins per se. But, we should be very hung up on profit and cash.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\nJon Moeller: Just one bit of summary for those of you who are still on the line. Again, as we reflect on this quarter, the point that I think is most important to take away is the momentum of the business and the robustness of the strategy and the brand portfolio that are driving that momentum, pre-COVID, during COVID, now, post-COVID. And I\u2019m happy to talk at greater length about that with any of you as the day and the week progresses. But, that is the takeaway here. And I really appreciate your time and your questions. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Good morning. We'd like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. A good quarter isn't difficult to explain. So, we're going to keep our prepared remarks brief with just a little over 10 minutes and then turn straight to your questions. July-September quarter provided a very strong start to the fiscal year, enabling us to increase guidance for organic sales growth, raise guidance for core earnings per share growth, increase guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity and raise our commitment for cash return to shareowners, organic sales up more than 9%, 7 points of volume growth, 1 point of positive mix and 1 point of price. We built strong momentum, leading up to the crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019. We maintained 6% growth in the first half of calendar 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increased production, to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And we accelerated to 9% this quarter against a strong 7% base period comparison. Strong momentum reflected the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business, pre, during and at some point post-COVID. Broad-based growth, U.S. organic sales up 16%, Greater China up 12%, focused markets up 11% and enterprise markets which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, up 5%; 9 out of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up more than 30%, Oral Care up mid-teens, Family Care up double-digits, Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care up high singles; Grooming up mid singles, Baby Care down low singles; aggregate market share growth of 30 basis points with 30 of our top 50 country category combinations holding our growing share; e-commerce sales up approximately 50% for the quarter. Turning to earnings, core earnings per share up 19%, currency neutral core earnings per share up 22%. Within this, core gross margin expansion of 140 basis points, up 170 basis points ex-FX. Core operating margin up 300 basis points, up 350 basis points excluding FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95%. We returned $4 billion of value to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $2 billion of P&G stock repurchase. In summary, a very strong start to the fiscal year, strong volume, sales and market share trends, strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and have been able to maintain this through the most recent quarter, supporting a guidance increase for all key financial metrics, organic sales, core earnings per share, cash productivity, and cash return. As we outlined each of the last two quarters, we've established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene, and the additional time we're all spending at home. Third, supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic, with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures as well as the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices which remain the right ones. These strategic choices are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. As you know, we focused our portfolio on daily use products and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and the competitiveness of our brands. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis, and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Next, success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In our current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Last, our new organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we've made, portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We believe our strategies, the success we've had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and the clean home all bode well for the future. We believe P&G is well-positioned to serve consumers' heightened needs and their changing behaviors, and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value-creation. We like our long-term prospects, though the near term will continue to be challenging, and it's a little more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources infrastructure, or in some cases the will to effectively manage it. We'll likely be operating without broadly available vaccines or advanced therapeutic through fiscal \u201821. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world. In the U.S., it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels, and when and how much mitigating economic stimulus will be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate and there is an ongoing risk of supply chain disruption, our operations or those of our suppliers. Against this challenging backdrop, we're still holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With a strong first quarter as a base, we're increasing our fiscal year guidance. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%, which includes some quarter-to-quarter ramp-down from Q1 as retail inventories are fully replenished and as promotions are partially reestablished. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year. We're increasing our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7% to a range of 5% to 8% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $325 million after tax, a foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $50 million after tax of higher freight costs. These headwinds should be partially offset by $175 million after tax of commodity costs tailwinds. Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to around 95%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $9 billion. Combined, dividends and share repurchase are planned to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, current commodity prices and current foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Wrapping up, we continue to execute winning strategies, a portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority in products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organization focus, agility and accountability. We feel we continue to have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the Company's facing, ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing product availability, and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization, always with our eyes fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation. With that, I'd be happy to take your questions. We do expect that there's some stickiness to new habits that are being formed, and new awareness that's been raised. It's hard for us to see in our interactions with consumers, that we're going to snap back and revert to the same attitudes and the same behaviors that we had collectively pre-COVID. Even things like the amount of inventory, pantry inventory I keep. In some ways, this is analogous that some of us remember our grandparents, for example, having survived the great depression, and they continued to hold on some more food and canned items that I could ever understand. But, it was because of what they've been through. Consumer habits, once they're established in our categories are rarely reversed. On occasion, under duress, they will be. But generally, once people start using a category, once they form a habit, it's phase. I'm sure there'll be some level of reversion. But, we do expect a permanent change at some level as well. Duration, your call is as good as mine. I have no ability to predict what's going to happen here from a viral standpoint or from a medical solution standpoint. On the margin, it can have an impact on where we want to play. We're happy with each of our current categories. The question is, are there additional opportunities that we want to be able to access? So, for example, we launched a hand sanitizer in the U.S. under the Safeguard brand name. You're aware of the Microban 24 surface disinfectant, which we're working hard to increase capacity on so we can meet very-high demands for that product. So generally, again, our portfolio is going to daily-use categories, performance drives brand choice, heavily centered on health, hygiene and a clean home is going to serve us very well on the situation, just as it did prior. But, the situation does present additional opportunities to step up and serve and help consumers with their health, hygiene and clean home needs. Thanks, Robert. I want to start in a slightly different place, but I'm going to bring it right around to the core of your question. So, be patient with me. We are maniacally focused on increasing and leading market growth. And when we do that, we do that with superior products, continuously increasing our margin of advantage, meeting additional needs, solve intention points across the portfolio. When we disproportionately are able to drive market growth, mathematically, we build share. And that share growth is much more sustainable achieved that way and is much generally much more profitable than if we were sourcing market share by taking business from other companies. So, we'd rather create than take, and in the process more sustainably build market share, which is very important, as well as sales and profit. In terms of e-commerce, it's a very competitive marketplace, just like other channels that we compete in. So, there are always ups and downs across categories. But, we find that the same general strategy that I articulated in our prepared remarks and that I just described parts of it and what I just provided is highly relevant in e-commerce, just like it is in brick and mortar. And we don't see a lot of -- there's some, but we don't see a ton of differentiation between our ability to succeed in an e-commerce format and a offline format, when we execute our strategies and when our products in categories where performance drives brand choice are truly superior. So, that's our focus. We look carefully at overall share progress online versus offline and margin progress online versus offline in an area, which is always dangerous. Of course, operationally, we move to lower levels of aggregation. We're indifferent between online and offline shopping, which is exactly where we want to be. I mentioned we grew e-commerce sales 50% in the quarter that we just completed. E-commerce sales are now probably 11% to 12% of our total. So, they're important. And we're just as focused on being successful in that channel as we are the others. No surprise to you or anyone on this call, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain environment with many more drivers of that uncertainty than we're historically accustomed to. And that certainly helps frame guidance, if not guidance ranges. Second, we've got a long way to go. So, we're through one quarter, we've got three more quarters to execute on in this very dynamic environment. Third, market growth, which is where we start in our outlook process, looks to be kind of 3% to 4% on a normalized basis. That's global. And so, 4% to 5%, as our new fiscal year guidance range is consistent with our desire to build market share, but I think realistic in its approach. Also, the quarter we just completed has two elements, and you mentioned one of them that will drive a higher top line result. The first is, there's been -- there was inventory replenishment to the trade during the quarter that was probably worth a point or two. And you mentioned as well lower levels of promotion. We still have categories where we have replenishment work to do. So, some of that benefit will carry forward into subsequent quarters, but many of our categories are for now replenished. And from a promotion standpoint, we've returned to somewhat normal levels of promotion in most categories in the U.S. except those where we still have work to catch up on replenishment, where demand exceeds our ability -- our current ability to supply, and that would be our Home Care business, our tissue/towel business and parts of our Health Care business. We do expect some normalization of promotion rates in the back half of the year. So, as we get into 2021, exactly what the cadence is of that and exactly what level things return to is not entirely clear. We're going to continue where we have the opportunity to prioritize spend on innovation and equity. There is nothing proprietary in promotion. But, we will be competitive from a promotion standpoint. I know that answer lacks the specificity you are looking for. The best I can do with the current state of a knowledge and the current state of volatility. I think, Dara, the question behind the question is, is there a possible upside to the guidance range? I think the answer is yes. But, I would also hasten to add that there's also downside. There is just a lot of moving pieces right now. Sure, Lauren. That is a -- Personal Health Care is a very attractive field of play, to use your description. It's one that, you are right, we've been investing behind. We purchased the German Merck OTC portfolio, which we're still in the middle of integrating, but very successfully. Our top-line growth on that business and our heritage P&G Personal Health Care business outside the United States, to your question of international, is growing at growth rates -- very attractive growth rates, high singles, double digits in some cases, ahead of the plan when we purchased those assets. And the good news is, cost synergies are also coming in nicely. So, that does give us confidence to continue looking for smart ideas to expand the current portfolio and to look for additional opportunities to create value with. And we'll be doing that. The German Merck OTC assets gave us about $1 billion sales international business, again, combined with things like Vicks and the heritage P&G portfolio. So, we now have a meaningful presence in many parts of the world that puts us -- and we've secured capabilities that put us in a position to drive this business and do it profitably. And that will be one of our focus areas going forward. Though I don't want to overemphasize that opportunity, we have, as you know, spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to land in the 10 categories that we've landed in. And our intention is to grow and to win and to seize opportunities and to do it profitably in each of them. But clearly, we see those same opportunities in the over-the-counter medicines business. We've talked for some time. David began talking about this at CAGNY several years ago, about the importance of winning in the U.S. and China. And we've been very intentional in establishing superior positions across our categories in those two markets. Even our organization design is structured to allow our -- the leadership of our Company to focus their time and effort on the focus markets with, as you say, China and U.S. being the most focused of the focused markets. And the combination of that organization choice, that prioritization choice and the execution of holistic strategy are what are making the difference in the U.S. and in China. The U.S. and China, from a category growth standpoint do have category growth rates that are higher on average than some other parts of the world. I take Europe as an example; currently, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa, as an example. But, I don't think that that is -- I mean, there is significant opportunity across the geographic portfolio, witnessed in the quarter we just completed, we grew organic sales and we grew earnings in every geographic segment. So, as we fully and holistically execute the strategy on a global basis, there should be opportunity to improve growth rates in the non-U.S. and non-China business. And we're going to have to work really hard to maintain strong growth rates in the U.S. and China, where we have very strong and able competition. The growth rates that we delivered most recently are very strong, very attractive. They were pre-COVID. They were certainly in the U.S. during covert, not so much in China. And the rebound in China has been encouraging to see. But, I think, from a sustainable standpoint, and we talked about this at Lauren's conference in the fall, earlier in the fall, you need to really start with what you expect market growth to be and assume we can build a couple of share points or a little bit of share on top of that to really ground yourself on what's reasonable to deliver over longer periods of time. Now, as I said earlier in this conversation, we have a responsibility to impact that market growth, and we believe we've done that certainly in the U.S., and we need to continue doing that. Very long-winded question, but the disproportionate growth in the U.S. and China is partly a function of those markets. It's partly a function of priority. It's partly a function of the execution of the strategy, and I think it has -- it's already had application elsewhere and will continue to even more so, as we move forward. I'm going to suggest you get with John Chevalier after the call. He can give you a more specific number on retail offtake during the quarter. Going at it kind of from the top of my head, I would guess it's probably 7 or 8, but John can help you with that. In terms of Grooming, Grooming continues to be a very attractive business. We grew the top-line on our Grooming business globally two years ago. We grew it last year, so two years in a row of growth. And we grew at 6% in the quarter that we just completed. Part of that -- part of the pickup in the business is a result of a more holistically serving all consumers. So, we've talked about SkinGuard as an example that was designed to meet the needs of a high percentage of men who had sensitive skin, for whom shaving was painful, and reduced that barrier to shave frequency and shaving in general. We launched now in some channels and in some parts of the world, a whole lineup of products under the brand of King C. Gillette that are designed to serve men who choose to maintain facial hair, so everything from trimmers to beard wax to conditioners, et cetera, and that has been going very, very well. And the third thing I would point to is very strong innovation on our dry shave business, which grew -- has been growing very attractively as well. This will continue to be a competitive category because of the attractiveness of the category. You should assume that that is built into our thinking and built into our plans. And I want to avoid any specific reference to pricing or promotion in a specific category of business. But, we are -- we like this business. It's growing. It's very profitable, highly cash-generative, and it's something we'll be investing behind. I really don't know how to break volume down with any confidence along the lines that you're requesting. So, I apologize for that. We have some great positions in diapers around the world, particularly in the pant style form, where we're market leaders, and that is the fastest-growing segment of the diaper market on a global basis. We're also doing very well in the premium portion of the business. As you rightly point out, we have not been superior in the middle of the market, what we call mainline. And we have, as you would expect, been working hard on that and have innovation coming to market across the world, beginning this quarter and next, and carrying on through 2021, which we expect to address that situation. We want to serve consumers in a superior fashion wherever they choose to shop. And that's really our focus. So, we're not focused on one channel versus another. We prefer to be channel-agnostic and let the consumer make that choice. And as long as we're very well-positioned with a superior product, a superior package that's relevant for the channel, communication that's relevant to the channel and have the right value, if they choose to shop in e-commerce, we'll win. If they choose to shop in brick-and-mortar, we'll win. If they choose a hybrid shopping experience like click and collect, if we're appropriately positioned, we should do very well. So, that's our focus vis-a\u0300-vis any specific channel focus. Within that, DTC clearly can play a role. As you mentioned, in some of our businesses, it's already a significant part of the operating model. It's -- it allows us to get closer to consumers to understand, to have an even better understanding of their needs and their habits, including their purchase habits, and that all can be very complementary and important in the broader context. So, you will see us continue to increase our DTC presence, but again, not at the preference of -- or the de-prioritization of any other channel of trade. I'm going to start where you ended, Olivia, and then I'll come back to competition. The strong quarters that we've been putting together are a reflection of our brand portfolio and our strategies, which built momentum for the business prior to COVID, have maintained momentum through COVID and allowed us to accelerate in the quarter that we just completed. These are a set of strategies in an activity system that were well suited to the pre-COVID environment, as we saw reflected in our results; are very well suited to the COVID environment, as you see reflected in our results; and we expect will be very well suited to someday a post-COVID environment. And that set of strategies and importantly the execution behind them on the part of 99,000 P&G men and women around the world is what's driving, as you rightly point to, growth on the top-line and the bottom line across each of our franchises. We talked about the challenge we still have in Baby Care and how we're going to address that. But 9 out of 10 categories grew top-line in the quarter. Each of our geographic regions grew top-line in the quarter, and that's really reflective of the execution of this integrated set of strategies that we've been working on for some time. We feel that is the best insulation against what is certainly a competitive marketplace across the board. I want to be careful though that we don't react necessarily to competitive statements about spending as inherently inducing risk. Competitive spending that's constructively structured and that grows -- increases consumer awareness and participation in categories is not a bad thing. So, what's more important is the how or the what. And we're early in the execution of some of those competitive agendas, and we'll see. But, I know for sure that our best chance of continuing our momentum and doing it profitably is to continue to execute the strategy that's been working for us so well. So, within the 300 basis points of operating margin improvement, about two-thirds is attributable to sales leverage, which still leaves a healthy third, around 100 basis points. That's due to the net of savings and productivity and our reinvestment in superiority. So, that's the breakdown that you've asked for. We are very clear in our own minds that on a going basis, we need to grow the top-line and we need to grow margin. So, everything we're executing is designed to do both, both now and moving forward. Thanks, Nik. I'm not smart enough to know where this all lands. What I can do is look at the data that are available to date. And that's a fairly encouraging set of data. If we look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, U.S. private label shares in the last three-month period are down 1 full point, which is an acceleration in the decline versus the prior three-month period, and the same dynamic generally holds true in Europe. There is just a heightened need for products that deliver against health, hygiene and clean home concerns and a willingness to spend just a little bit more to ensure that I'm using a product that I know and trust and believe will work for me and for my family. So, in most of our categories, that's the dynamic that's playing. Supporting that direction, unlike prior crisis, or very different from prior crisis, is a whole reconfiguration of the consumer budget. They're not spending money generally on travel, on entertainment, at a meal at a restaurant, on apparel. So, they do have some flexibility. It's more prevalent now than has been the case historically, which they can redirect and many are redirecting if they choose to do so. Now, I want to be careful here. I'm not suggesting that there isn't greater economic stress ahead of us or that it won't have more of an impact than we've seen thus far. I just don't have the ability to predict where that goes or lands. I can only really reflect on what we've seen thus far, which is in total, encouraging. First of all, any meaningful change in the tax structure at the corporate level in all probability requires a change in the executive branch and control of the Senate. So, that's the first handicapping that anybody has to do in order to understand whether there's likely to be change. The second point I would make is, there's a lot of conversation and rhetoric at the surface of this issue. But, if we go back to why did so many of us push so hard for so long on corporate tax reform, and again, I'm dealing with the corporate piece of this, and why was it eventually enacted. There were some very powerful and important motivators that I don't think have diminished in their importance. The first was we wanted American companies to be fully competitive in non-American markets, which would give American companies every opportunity to attract capital, to grow, to create jobs, to increase America's standard of living. The second motivation was to prevent capital flight to make it attractive to be domiciled and headquartered here in America as opposed to moving operations to other parts of the world. And the third, which is closely related to the second, is we wanted to incent capital formation onshore versus offshore. Those are very strong motivators and very important dynamics that I don't think anyone's going to casually walk past. So, I just offer that in terms of the amount of thought, deliberation and consideration that I expect will go into any recommended change that to date collectively hasn't been applied most recently to this question. So, I'm stopping shorter than a specific answer on the numerics. It's going to be highly dependent on the details of what if anything happens. And that answer is going to be driven by, I think, a lot more reflection on the three questions that I just mentioned as well as some others. I understand the question on the breakdown of dry versus wet shave. I don't have the data. But, if you call John, he can certainly get that for you. The commodity environment, in my way of thinking, hasn't changed dramatically since we provided guidance for the year. There's been an increase in pulp, as an example, an increase in some of the other items we purchased. But, overall, it's a relatively, on a historical basis, benign environment at the moment. Oil and the petro complex is generally somewhat range-bound. I'll leave it there. Mix is a very complicated animal because there is not just category mix, but there is geographic mix. And so, for example, when the U.S. grows faster than almost any other market, both with its sales rate or revenue per case and its profitability, that has a significant impact as do the category differences that you referenced. To get to the conundrum of gross margin going one way as it relates to mix and P&L going another way, I've talked about this quite a bit. And it's a reason that I really don't -- I'm not focused on margins. We're not focused on margins. I don't want that to scare anybody because I didn't say we weren't focused on profit and cash. But, margins are an interesting animal. I can't put margins in a bank. I can't return margins to shareowners. I can't really invest margins in innovation. What I can do, what we can do is invest profit and cash in each of those things. We can put that in the bank. We can redistribute that to shareholders that we can invest it in increasing our margin of superiority. We have -- many of our premium offerings carry a lower gross margin but a higher penny profit. Laundry unit dose is an example of that dynamic. I'll take that higher penny profit every day of the week, even though it may degrade our gross margin to some degree. But, that's the dynamic, the delta between a margin and penny profit that's driving the math that you're seeing. And that's why we can't get hung up in margins per se. But, we should be very hung up on profit and cash. Just one bit of summary for those of you who are still on the line. Again, as we reflect on this quarter, the point that I think is most important to take away is the momentum of the business and the robustness of the strategy and the brand portfolio that are driving that momentum, pre-COVID, during COVID, now, post-COVID. And I'm happy to talk at greater length about that with any of you as the day and the week progresses. But, that is the takeaway here. And I really appreciate your time and your questions. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '22 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '23 and then take your questions. Fiscal 2022 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies continues to yield strong sales, earnings and cash results in an incredibly difficult operating environment. We delivered broad-based strong top line growth across categories and regions, earnings growth in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong return of cash to P&G shareowners. Organic sales for the fiscal grew 7%, up 13% on a two-year stack, up 19% on a three-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew 20%. Fabric Care and Feminine Care grew double digits; Baby Care, up high single digits; Oral Care and Grooming, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care, Skin and Personal Care and Family Care each grew low singles; Focus Markets were up 5% for the year; Enterprise Markets, 10%. We delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 8%, up 16% on a two-year stack. E-commerce sales increased 11%, now representing 14% of company total. Our integrated strategies continue to drive strong market growth, and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 6% in fiscal '22. P&G value share continued to grow, up 90 basis points for the year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share grew 3% for the year despite a 22 percentage point headwind to earnings from commodities, freight and foreign exchange. Our initial outlook predicted $1.8 billion after tax of headwinds. We ended up at $3.2 billion. So despite an incremental $1.4 billion of earnings pressure versus ingoing plan, we delivered core EPS growth within our initial guidance range for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 5%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 93%. We increased our dividend by 5% and returned nearly $19 billion of value to shareowners, $8.8 billion in dividends and $10 billion in share repurchase. Moving to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 7%. Pricing contributed 8 points to organic sales growth as additional price increases reached the market. Mix was flat and volume declined 1 point, which is due to reduced operations in Russia. Volume for the balance of the business excluding Russia was up 1 point. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Nine of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew mid-teens; Fem Care was up low teens; Fabric Care grew double digits; Oral Care, up high singles; Baby Care and Family Care, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care and Grooming, each grew low singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with Focus Markets up 3% and Enterprise Markets up 18% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%, up 24% on a three-year stack. European Focus Markets were up 3%. Excluding Russia, Europe Focus Markets were up 7%. Greater China organic sales were down 11%, mainly due to COVID-driven lockdowns in major regions of the market. Since lockdowns have eased, we've seen sequential market recovery but somewhat slower than expected when we gave guidance last quarter. In Enterprise Markets, each of the three regions grew organic sales 14% or more. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.21, up 7% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 12%. Core operating margin decreased 30 basis points as gross margin pressure were largely offset by sales leverage and productivity improvements in SG&A. Currency-neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Free cash flow productivity was 99%. We returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, nearly $2.3 billion in dividends and nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year, organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, strong performance in very difficult operating conditions. Now I'll pass it over to Jon.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Andre. P&G employees have delivered great results over the past four years in a very challenging macro environment against very capable competition. In those four years, P&G people have added more than $13 billion in annual sales and roughly $5 billion in after-tax profit, executing our integrated strategies with excellence. I want to publicly thank our colleagues in product supply and R&D, who have enabled this progress with formulation, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics agility and extraordinary commitment to serve consumers, customers and each other through walk-downs, inbound supply shortages, outbound truck shortages, port blockages, natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. What P&G's people have accomplished together is truly extraordinary. Still, we're very clear-eyed about the trials ahead. The list of challenges we face heading into our new fiscal year is longer than any I can recall. The progress we've made and our collective commitment to our strategies give me confidence we can manage through these challenges. We've never been better positioned. A portfolio that's focused on daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, in-store execution and value; leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them; creating business versus taking business; powerful with our retail partners as we work to jointly create value. We've developed a productivity muscle that helps address some of the challenges we face. We remain fully committed to cost and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet in each business and corporately. Productivity improvement is a necessity to drive balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry and in this dynamic and challenging environment requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure is yielding what we intended: a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other. This improved agility and accountability have been important enablers of our strong results in the dynamic environment we faced. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of the strategy. The first is supply, improved capacity, agility, cost efficiency and resilience for a new reality and a new age. The capability investments we made prior to COVID to improve our manufacturing and distribution networks have helped us to manage through the last few years with relatively few prolonged issues. We're already making the next round of investments needed to ensure we have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs, sufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing demand and flexibility to meet the changing needs of all types of retailers. The second area is environmental sustainability, integrated into our product packaging and supply chain innovation work, irresistibly superior offerings that are sustainable. New cardboard packaging on Gillette razors is an improvement for the environment and a noticeably superior experience for consumers at the first and second moments of truth. New fully recyclable paper packaging on our premium Always cotton protection pads recently launched in Germany. Laundry detergent formulations that deliver superior cleaning in cold water, reducing energy usage, saving money and extending garment lifespans for consumers. Third, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision-making. Increased digitization on manufacturing lines, more use of AI, more use of blockchain are not ends in to themselves. There are tools we can use to delight consumers and customers at the most reasonable cost possible. Fourth, our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. By definition, this must include equality. To deliver a superior employee value equation, there must be something in it for everyone. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority and reducing cost to enable investment to value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. The operational costs and currency challenges we faced over the last two years will continue in fiscal '23. We began the new fiscal year with consumers facing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years. We know one of the most pressing questions out there is how we plan to deal with the severe cost and currency impacts we're facing: $6.5 billion after tax in just two years, nearly an $8 billion hit to operating profit. I'll repeat what I said on our April 2020 earnings call: the best response to uncertainties and challenges we face is to double down on the integrated set of strategies that are delivering very strong results. It won't be easy. There will be bumps along the road, but we have the portfolio, superiority, productivity and in my not-so-humble opinion, the best organization in the world. We have everything we need. So again, I think we are very well positioned. We're committed to keep investing to strengthen the superiority of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity to deliver superior value for consumers in every price tier in which we compete. Alongside our productivity work, we'll continue to offset a portion of the cost impacts with price increases. Whenever possible, we'll close a couple of those price increases with innovation. Those moves will be tailored to the market, category and brand. As consumers face increased pressure on nearly every aspect of their household budgets, we invest to deliver truly superior value in combination of price and product performance to earn their loyalty every day. So far, elasticities in most categories where we've taken price increases have been better than our historical experience. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, and the four focus areas that I mentioned strengthen the execution of that strategy. When all of this is executed well, we grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These integrated strategies are a pathway to delivering balanced growth. We've been talking about the importance of balance for a long time in the context of needing both top line and bottom line growth to deliver value for shareowners. We're in a world that needs more from us now. We need to expand that concept to serve and delight consumers, customers, employees, society and our shareowners. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do any of those, we will fail to do all of them. Our consumers increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also a wonderful opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow our categories and create more value, all while positively impacting the environment and society. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain at the right strategic framework as we move forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2023.\nAndre Schulten: Thank you, Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past two years, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead. This rings true again as we enter fiscal 2023. The combined year-on-year profit headwinds from foreign exchange rates, freight costs, materials, fuel, energy and wage inflation are an even greater challenge in fiscal '23 than they were in fiscal '22. Based on current spot prices and supply contracts, we estimate commodities, raw materials and packaging material costs to be a $2.1 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs are expected to be higher in fiscal '23 compared to the average cost paid in fiscal '22 by roughly $300 million after tax. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us even since our presentation at the Deutsche Bank Conference in June. We now expect foreign exchange to be a $900 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at $3.3 billion after tax, roughly equal to the challenge we faced in fiscal '22, a 23 percentage point headwind to EPS growth or roughly $1.33 per share as we start the year. As Jon said in his review of our strategies, we're working to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds through a combination of innovation to create and extend the superiority of our brands, productivity in all aspects of our work, and pricing. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 3% to 4% with strong price contribution offset by modest decreases in unit volume. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow at or above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal '23. On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus fiscal '22 EPS of $5.81. This guidance equates to a range of $5.81 to $6.05 per share, $5.93 or up 2% at the center of the range. Considering a 6-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 6% to 10% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. There are many possible scenarios that could cause us to be outside of this range to either side, high or low. While it's relatively easy to envision many possible scenarios, steeper inflation, deep recession, further geopolitical disruption or commodity cost reversion easing inflation, peaceful conflict resolution, it's very difficult to assign probability to any single scenario. As a result, we set the range we feel is most probable based on market conditions as we see them today. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes a step-up in capital spending as we begin to add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock. Combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts.\nJon Moeller: The macroeconomic and market-level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : I just had a couple of clarification questions related to the guidance. And I guess the first one is -- just want to make sure I'm looking at this correctly. If I look at the implied step-up in the tax rate and then the share repurchases, they sort of offset each other. So seems like the underlying guide assumes that profit growth will equal whatever revenue growth is. Just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Our core EPS guidance, as I said, in the range of flat to plus 4% with a tax rate slightly higher than what we've seen in the previous fiscal year. This is driven by geographic mix changes, and it's also driven by reduced benefit from stock option redemption. From an operating profit standpoint, you're in the right ballpark. And I would leave it at that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: You both spoke a number of times, I think Jon reinforced it at the end of the prepared remarks, about the need to drive continued cost and cash productivity. As I reflect on fiscal '22, I think it's fair to say that the expense productivity was an area that came in a bit light of going in expectations, at least external expectations. As you turn the page to fiscal '23, and maybe this is embedded in the answer to help drive that operating profit growth you just talked about, Andre. What's your confidence, your line of sight to be able to accelerate productivity in the year ahead? That's my main question. If you could also comment on just the -- mix has been a very material driver of margin for a while now. And I'm just curious to see your base case of how mix impacts your margin outlook in '23 as well.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Steve. On productivity, you're right, it has to be a significant contributor to how we offset the inflationary cost impacts and enable reinvestment in the business in combination with pricing and innovation, as we said before. In fiscal '22, maybe let's go by area. From a cost of goods productivity standpoint, we've talked about us prioritizing production of cases to ship them and innovation as we were capacity-constrained. That has limited our ability to get cost savings qualified and through the P&L. That is changing in this current fiscal year. As the capacity situation eases, as we add more capacity and catch up with demand, we are able to get more cost savings qualified, catch up on some of the cost savings we delayed in fiscal '22. So we are expecting growth savings in the COGS area to get back to pre-COVID levels in this fiscal year. We are very confident in our teams. They are -- have an unlimited number of creative ideas to drive further productivity. That still obviously is needed to offset inflation, which is equally strong in the fiscal year. From a media standpoint, we have delivered significant productivity over the past years, but we have reinvested all of that productivity and incremental media spend ahead of sales leverage, ahead of the productivity numbers even that we generated. And that productivity continues to strengthen. We have developed strong capability to target better both on TV as well as in digital. Our ability to improve effectiveness of reach and quality of reach is allowing us to drive cost per effective reach down both in digital and in TV. We've shifted more and more spend into digital. Now more than 50% of our advertising is in digital. And with that, we are rolling out these capabilities to more and more businesses and more and more regions. That allows us to increase productivity on media spend in the current fiscal year to the point where we believe we will use some of that productivity not to reinvest fully but to actually flow through and help offset inflation. And some of that you saw in Q4 combined with other effects. General sales leverage and productivity on SG&A driven by sales leverage is well intact. You saw it flow through in quarter 4. That was 180 basis points helped to operating margin, and that should continue. So in summary, I feel good about our productivity muscle. It continues to strengthen, and it will be needed to help offset some of the inflationary pressures we see. On product mix, we continue to see the same effect that we've seen in previous quarters, which is a negative impact to gross margin, roughly 130 basis points on the quarter, positive impact when you think about our portfolio. What we see is that consumers that come into the P&G portfolio and we had big success in driving trial over the past two years. Those consumers, if they try P&G products, they tend to trade up. And that trade-up comes with increased unit sales. It comes with increased penny profit, but the gross margin is slightly dilutive. The example we use generally is Tide pods, about a 50% premium in unit sales versus liquid detergent per load, significantly higher unit profit, but from a gross margin percentage standpoint, slightly lower. So that same effect continues, and we expect that trade-up, hopefully, to continue in this fiscal.\nOperator: Our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian : I just wanted to discuss your level of visibility on the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for fiscal '23. Obviously, there's a lot that builds into that, but I was curious for your perspective in a couple of areas. First, just the competitive environment. What are you seeing in your categories with a strong 8% pricing this quarter? Are competitors generally matching pricing in your categories? And then, B, you're only assuming modest P&G market share gains for fiscal '23 with the 3% to 5% corporate organic sales growth and 3% to 4% category growth. So can you discuss what's driving the moderation in P&G market share gains and how potential pickup in private label share might play into that and the fiscal Q4 results?\nAndre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Dara. You're right. Our top line guidance is, as always, grounded in what we expect in the marketplace. We see moderation -- or we expect moderation in the overall value growth in the market from the 5% we had over the past 12 months back to 3% to 4%. And we expect pricing to be the main driver in that market growth with volumes slightly down. That is a logical consequence of the broad-based pricing that we are seeing in the market, assuming there will be elasticity. We've seen elasticity, albeit better than expected based on historical levels, but we're seeing elasticity in the market, and that's reflected in our market growth assumption. We have full confidence in our ability to compete in this environment. Our categories being daily-use categories that consumers don't deselect even when they see high levels of inflation, our focus on Irresistible Superiority, our ability to make strong value claims based on that superiority, the breadth of our portfolio across the price letter and value tiers and across channels positions us well to compete in the environment. And most importantly, the strength in our innovation portfolio and the runway we have in driving household penetration and trade-up within the portfolio has us focused really on driving market growth. And that inherently drives share growth for us. That's part of our assumption to market size and relative share growth. As to the private label point, we see private label reemergence in some categories, mainly in the paper categories in some regions. Broadly, what I would tell you at this point, while we acknowledge private label coming back, partly due to supply dynamics in the base, we are still able to grow share in those markets where we see private label coming back. In the U.S. in the recent period, private label coming up a little bit in Family Care. But overall, we've been able to drive share growth on an all-outlet basis. In Europe, private label shares are stronger. Private labels are reemerging in some of the markets. But for example, in the UK and France and Germany, we all have positive share reads in the most recent period. So we're keeping a close eye on it. But again, I want to bring it back to the strategy, the portfolio, the superiority, the innovation, and we believe we are well positioned and continue to be well positioned to serve the consumer in this environment.\nJon Moeller : I just want to add one thing to that. Agree with everything that Andre said, both due to base period dynamics across ourselves and our competitive set and, as you said, Dara, due to many dynamics that are impacting both top and bottom line as we move forward. There will likely be more volatility in the numbers. There will be some bumps along the road. And you'll have to be careful how much you read into any one-week or four-week period. We've got our eyes focused on a longer time period than that, and we'll be managing accordingly.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Two things, I guess, first is notwithstanding, Jon, your comments just now on scanner -- implied on scanner data. In the U.S., the market share performance has changed course. It's down slightly. It looks like a mix of things in terms of competitor supply perhaps coming back. But I was just curious if you could comment on U.S. market share performance in general was number one. And then number two was China, which I believe is 9% or 10% of your sales, down 11% is significant. I know that you've signaled previously that China was challenged because of the COVID lockdowns, but it does seem like it's disproportionate rate of decline versus what others are talking about. So if you could just talk to us a little bit about why your performance in China looks to be different than what we're hearing from some other multinationals. If it's specific to market share, if it's specific to mechanics of your operations? Just curious on some insights there.\nJon Moeller: Let me just start in response to that question, Lauren, and then kick it over to Andre. We need to keep coming back to the strength of the top line. So in the U.S., for example, we grew 6% in the quarter, 8% over the course of the year. As you know, 7% total company, both on the year and the quarter. And that strength is broad-based. That's important. And we continue to protect project top line growth as well as modest share growth going forward. I'll ask Andre to provide specific commentary on China.\nAndre Schulten: Very good. Hey, Lauren, on the -- maybe I'll start quickly with the U.S. share, if you let me. You're right. If you look at the past one week and past four weeks, we see a kind of 10 basis point, 20 basis point decline. And that's -- as Jon said, there will be wobbles along the way. The base period is extremely volatile. If you look at absolute shares in the U.S., we're up over the last 52 weeks, last 13 weeks to the last one week, we continue to increase absolute shares. If you look at the periods that you're reading at the moment, just to give a bit more color, the two businesses that are down over this period are Fabric Care and Family Care. Just to give color on the period effects here and the wobbles. Fabric Care had an amazing run in the U.S., 11% up on the quarter, 12% up for the year and high tier -- low teens up over the past two years. And we haven't kept up with capacity and that came to a head in March. Just as we are installing and starting up new capacity, we were supply-constrained over the AMJ quarter. So we reduced merch investment, we reduced media investment because we just didn't have the cases. That is fixed in July. We're back in full supply as we started up new capacity, merchants reinstated, media reinstated. Family Care-based period, you know the situation in Family Care on supply has been very constrained. And again, you're reading mainly base period effects, not sequential share effects. All-outlet share in the U.S. continues to be up. So we feel very confident in our U.S. business overall. China, you're right. We have been significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns. The read for us across our category footprint and regional footprint in China is that the market contracted double digits over the quarter periods that we're reading, and that is reflected in the results. More importantly, since consumer mobility started to resume, the COVID lockdowns are easing, we're seeing a return to growth in our categories. Our shares are responding favorably. So we're hopeful that we return to mid-single-digit growth in China over the next few quarters. Certainly, the team on the ground is excited, capable and has everything ready to go, but we need to see that consumer mobility come back.\nJon Moeller : And Lauren, relative to your question on the relative share performance, where you happen to have manufacturing operations located has a big impact on your ability to supply the market. And we had -- we were pretty significantly impacted by the location of some of the shutdowns, namely Shanghai, where we have manufacturing centers and important contract manufacturer supply. So that's one of the reasons for some of the noise within the share comparison.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English : Two questions. I guess kind of coming back to some of the topics that have already been raised. First on market growth assumptions, the anticipated deceleration, is this coming from an anticipation that consumers are going to use less so as volume comes in, trade down so mix comes in? Or maybe we lap some pricing and bring some more promotions back so pricing comes in? Which of those 3 components do you expect to be the bigger driver of category to sell?\nAndre Schulten : The -- it's a combination of what you described. As we said, pricing generally comes with a level of elasticity. Consumers don't leave the category, but they might look at their dosing behaviors. They might look a little bit closer at their inventories and draw that down over a period of time, specifically as they are more exposed to inflation broadly in the marketplace with the highest inflation in 40 years, it'd be naive to assume the consumer is not looking at their cash outlay and their spending even in our categories. Though we see the elasticities be more favorable than historical norms to date, we continue our assumption that they return to historical elasticities going forward. We hope that's not the case, but our assumption is that, that returns to what we've seen in the past. The other element I would point to is just normalization of consumption patterns. As we saw very elevated consumption growth over the last two years, some of that will, at a total market level probably return to more normal levels. Our job within that is for our brands and our categories to drive the household penetration opportunities, which we have. They are huge even in the most developed markets, even in the most developed categories, and that's what we're going to focus on.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: My question is on potential implications from the fallout with Walmart and your bigger retailers more broadly feeling margin pressure. From a category perspective, it's sort of well understood the issues are more general merchandise and not consumer staples. But we have seen some ripple effects, right? They've announced freight fuel charges, which we have seen. So my question is really around any implications that you may be concerned about, whether more difficulty taking price, greater request for trade promotion. So any comments you have there in terms of what's going on with large retail customers would be helpful.\nAndre Schulten : Yes. Kevin, I'll start, and then Jon might want to add here. In general, we acknowledge -- as you said, Walmart indicated that the pressure they are seeing is in general merchandise and apparel. Our categories, when you think about the HPC categories broadly in Walmart and across all retailers in the U.S., really are still growing at a good clip. Our interests are generally aligned with retailers' interest as our job is to provide the best possible value to consumers as defined by price and performance of the product. We both want to drive footfall to the store. We both want to drive traffic to the shelf. We both want to drive consumption of our propositions. In that sense, we continue to work constructively with Walmart and with all retailers to do that in the best possible way. Our strategy, grounded in the categories we play in, that are generally not categories that consumers deselect even in difficult times, our superiority, our investment in innovation, our intention to drive category growth and to win with our retailers versus purely focusing on share growth, all of those are good things. In our mind, all of those are good things in the minds of retailers. The dialogue generally remains constructive but focused on providing the best possible value to the consumer.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein : Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your price increases in July, maybe give a sense of order of magnitude and breadth, early reception. And then assuming the sort of elasticities that you expect, how far can those increases go to offsetting the $3.2 billion or $3.3 billion of headwinds that you outlined earlier?\nAndre Schulten: The increases we're taking, and we've announced in June, July, are going into effect broadly in this quarter, July, August, September, towards the latter half of it. They are across most categories in the U.S. And we also announced pricing globally in the same ballpark, mid-single digits, but very differentiated. So in general, I would tell you, mid-singles -- probably mid- to high singles, but really tailored by country, by brand, by SKU to ensure that we do what I just described retailers are looking for, provide the best value for their relevant shoppers in terms of absolute price point, product performance and value tier. The reaction to those price increases from a retailer environment is what you would expect. Nobody is pleased about the continued inflationary trends that we're seeing, but it remains a constructive discussion on how to best execute what we need both from a retailer standpoint and from a manufacturer standpoint, which is recovery of inflationary cost measures to the extent that cannot be covered by productivity. In terms of our ability to offset the latest inflationary trends across commodities and transportation, pricing is part of that. But the pricing we're taking is not covering the entire breadth of increases that we're seeing that needs to be a combined effort between pricing, innovation and driving trade-up via innovation and productivity. But we feel good about every part of that equation. Our innovation portfolio is stronger than ever. Our productivity muscle is strong, and pricing dynamics and conversations remain productive.\nJon Moeller : Just one additional point, Rob, the -- relative to the competitive environment. We're seeing price increases on private label brands and on mid-tier offerings that are even higher in some cases than our own price increases. I just offer that perspective as it relates to the ability to hold pricing and what it might mean for market share. As Andre said, it's a fairly constructive environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I'd like to talk a little bit more about the $1.33. It's such a substantial amount of money between commodities and FX and what's incorporated in there, particularly, whether it's forward purchasing agreements, hedges, any of those sorts of things. And I'm asking for, I guess, an obvious reason, which is commodity costs very recently have come down. And I'm sure you don't feel the benefit immediately, but how should -- if this is to continue, which is possible, how should we think about the impact that's going to have on the estimates you've given us so far?\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Kaumil. Yes. If you break it down, the $1.33, $2.1 billion of the $3.3 billion is driven by commodities, $900 million by FX and $300 million by transportation. On the commodity side -- so let me take each bucket here. On the commodity side, we've seen some of our commodities annualized, as you said, and maybe even decrease. But we've seen the majority of our commodity basket still increase week-over-week month-over-month. So when you look at our overall commodity exposure, it is at this point in time stable to increasing. And our assumption going forward is at spot rates. So we assume stability within the commodity price environment versus current spot. We do not hedge our commodities. We are counting on our offsets within our total exposure between commodity FX and interest rates. So spot is the assumption we are using. And we still see slight increases week-over-week, month-over-month, certainly not to the tune that we saw at the beginning of '22. On the foreign exchange rate, that is the fastest-increasing headwind, also a big headwind in quarter 4 that we had to overcome. The interest rate differentials keep widening versus the U.S. So we anticipate that headwind could further expand. But our forecast is based on current spot rate, so the same methodology as on commodities. Transportation is a rollover versus the average price that we have paid in '21, '22. We see a little bit of easing here on the rate side. If you look at the load-to-driver ratio in the U.S., for example, that's down from a peak of 12 to now 4, which is more normalized. And some of the spot rates are coming down. That hasn't rolled over into contract rates at this point in time. If that happens, that could be a tailwind. Ocean freight, you see the number of ships waiting to get unloaded is decreasing. So that's normalizing. What I'll offer as the offset obviously is energy prices, fuel prices. So this one might offer some relief. But again, so far, we see this offset by fuel cost.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey : So you noted that trade promotion was expected to be about $300 million after tax. I think you're referring to promotional spending, which is not an item, I think, typically, you call out specifically. So it does seem like you're indicating a more intentional desire to pick up promotional spending in order to help the consumer weather some of these cost increases. Is that a fair characterization? And then obviously, your price increases across much of your portfolio ahead. But are there specific categories or geographies where you specifically intend to lean in or where you think the consumer or the retailers need the most help?\nAndre Schulten : Good morning, Chris. On the promo side, I'm not sure we intended to mention any number. But let me describe where we are. But John Chevalier can certainly clarify afterwards, if that question remains open. Our promotion strategy remains the same. If you look at promotion levels, they are relatively stable. I take the U.S. as the market where we have the best visibility and you have the best visibility. We're running at about 27% of merch, so that's volume sold on deal, and depth combined. That compares to a pre-COVID level slightly above 30% to a COVID low at 16%. But that 27% has been relatively stable over the past few quarters. So there's no significant increase in what we're observing. We are not planning to increase significantly. But that, again, is a very tactical decision that is being made at the market level at the category level. But our intention to win is via innovation via clarity of value offer, via our superiority, not via price promotion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira : So my question is on RGM. I guess I'm not missing if you're prospectively or more reactively introducing new price points, perhaps type simply pulling some of these levers to help the consumer or if you're seeing basically the retailers, your customers requesting more of that help or that's too early to say. And if you can walk through what has happened with Beauty in China on new exits of the quarter. I guess that's one area that you could potentially see improvement there. If you can help us kind of like bridge that gap?\nAndre Schulten : Good morning, Andrea. On revenue growth management, that has been a priority for us, not only in the recent quarter but really over the past two to three years. So what we're benefiting from now was very intentional design of our revenue growth strategies over that period of time, including portfolio choices to have brand offerings available that cover different value tiers. When you think about diapers, for example, we have the premium-tier Pampers Pure at $0.38 per diaper, Swaddlers at about $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20 a diaper. So that's one example. And this exists across really all brands. And we've been very intentional in building our presence in these different value tiers in the market, so we can serve consumers with different preferences between performance and price. We have also spent a lot of time and design effort in creating the right price points. And those price points relevant on everyday price but also providing the right merch price points for different channels. So that's work that's been going on in every category. And then lastly, we've expanded our distribution across channels that consumers would go to in a more value-driven environment, think about hard discounters or dollar channel, to ensure that we have strong relationships with our retail partners there, strong distribution and offerings. So that work, yes, is indeed very important, but it has been ongoing over a longer period of time. As we take pricing, we ensure that we protect that strategy very carefully. And that's why pricing is so differentiated between markets, brands, channels as we execute. On Beauty China, what I'll tell you is that we remain very confident that the Chinese market offers very attractive growth rates and very attractive value-creation opportunities for us. As mobility returns, as department stores reopen, as we develop stronger capability in digital channels, as we refocus our business on the core brand equities, we see progress. The progress is still relatively slow because mobility is only just reopening. But we remain very confident that, that business offers a lot of opportunity, and we are well positioned with our brands to play.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Jon, this may be a little bit of a softball question, but I think we've run out of ways to ask about pricing in the consumer. But in your prepared remarks and then also I heard you on CNBC this morning say, \"P&G is the best organization in the world.\" And I'm struck by that. In the 15 years I've known you, you've never been a cheerleader or someone to throw out superlatives. And coming on a quarter when technically, stock is down and you've missed, just why you feel that way now? Is the kind of turnaround or the catching of breath complete? You seem to want to get that message out there. So just anything more color you could give would be interesting and helpful.\nJon Moeller: There's clearly a desire to recognize extraordinary effort and results on the part of our organization broadly defined. The challenges that have been overcome while maintaining or improving service to consumers, customer and delivering both strong top and bottom line results, that's just not an accident. And we've been trying to become even more intentional about the importance of our organization, of our employee value proposition and delivering and sustaining superiority over time. So it's just, Bill, a reflection of that reality and my confidence in this organization to continue to step up and step forward into the challenges we face and continue to deliver strong progress from a business standpoint.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong : I'll be quick, but just two quick questions. First, are there more price actions planned versus what's already been announced? Is there anything being contemplated or everything that's been announced has been announced? And then secondly, just if you could give some color on your innovation pipeline and how it skews this year versus previous years potentially. Is there more premium versus more value and how you think about it in terms of contribution to price and mix?\nAndre Schulten: Hey, Olivia. On pricing, my answer is going to be quick. What's announced is announced, and everything else we can't talk about. But it's going to be a combination of pricing, productivity and innovation. That's as much as I can tell you. And we're always evaluating pricing and the necessity for pricing in every market every day. So that's an ongoing discussion. In terms of innovation, fundamentally, our innovation pipeline looks out five years, 10 years. The innovation pipeline continues to be strong. It continues to drive superiority across the full portfolio because that's the definition of superiority. It's not just the premium end, and that doesn't really change. So when we talk Irresistible Superiority, we mean Irresistible Superiority at every price point for every product, for every consumer that we choose to compete for versus the relevant competitive offering. And that drives the innovation strategy and the strength of the innovation. I see it only improving and being broad-based.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan : One question and just a clarification or a reminder. How -- can you help us on just the leverage that you get from an SG&A standpoint given the volumes that we've seen over the last couple of years and then put that in the context of the slight volume decline in the June quarter just as a reminder there? That would be helpful. And then more broadly, how do you think about the ability to sustainably invest given the exchange rates? And specifically, I'm talking about obviously dollar strength versus a lot of other currencies, especially given some of your overseas current -- overseas competitors who don't obviously have the translational impact. So how does that influence, if it does, your ability to sustainably invest and maintain those levels of investment going forward if the dollar remains where it is?\nAndre Schulten : Thanks, Mark. On SG&A leverage, so from a -- let me maybe start with the broader leverage point. So we generally see sales leverage when we see growth in the range of 3% to 4%, roughly. When we go north of 4%, the leverage becomes relevant and material, and that's SG&A leverage. So if we grow in line with our guidance range, that will provide a level of sales leverage similar to what we would typically and historically have expected. On the COGS side, you're right, the volume is the key driver for the leverage. With flat volumes, as we've seen in the fourth quarter, there obviously is no leverage. But that's where our productivity efforts are even more important. And that's why we're doubling down on our acceleration of productivity improvements. We'll talk about this more, I think, in our Investor Day, where we'll give you a bit more insight on Supply Chain 3.0 just to put more substance around the runway that we still have in driving productivity. That also is the answer to your second question because you're right, foreign exchange rate represents a significant headwind for us, might not represent that much of a headwind for some of our international competitors. We're well aware of that. We've been to this movie a few times. The answer to our question is strong growth, serving the consumer better than everybody else, delivering top line growth. That fuels our ability to invest in combination with strong productivity. So it reinforces our growth model. It reinforces the need for all components of the strategy to work.

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Thanks, Andre. P&G employees have delivered great results over the past four years in a very challenging macro environment against very capable competition. In those four years, P&G people have added more than $13 billion in annual sales and roughly $5 billion in after-tax profit, executing our integrated strategies with excellence. I want to publicly thank our colleagues in product supply and R&D, who have enabled this progress with formulation, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics agility and extraordinary commitment to serve consumers, customers and each other through walk-downs, inbound supply shortages, outbound truck shortages, port blockages, natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. What P&G's people have accomplished together is truly extraordinary. Still, we're very clear-eyed about the trials ahead. The list of challenges we face heading into our new fiscal year is longer than any I can recall. The progress we've made and our collective commitment to our strategies give me confidence we can manage through these challenges. We've never been better positioned. A portfolio that's focused on daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, in-store execution and value; leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them; creating business versus taking business; powerful with our retail partners as we work to jointly create value. We've developed a productivity muscle that helps address some of the challenges we face. We remain fully committed to cost and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet in each business and corporately. Productivity improvement is a necessity to drive balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry and in this dynamic and challenging environment requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure is yielding what we intended: a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other. This improved agility and accountability have been important enablers of our strong results in the dynamic environment we faced. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of the strategy. The first is supply, improved capacity, agility, cost efficiency and resilience for a new reality and a new age. The capability investments we made prior to COVID to improve our manufacturing and distribution networks have helped us to manage through the last few years with relatively few prolonged issues. We're already making the next round of investments needed to ensure we have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs, sufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing demand and flexibility to meet the changing needs of all types of retailers. The second area is environmental sustainability, integrated into our product packaging and supply chain innovation work, irresistibly superior offerings that are sustainable. New cardboard packaging on Gillette razors is an improvement for the environment and a noticeably superior experience for consumers at the first and second moments of truth. New fully recyclable paper packaging on our premium Always cotton protection pads recently launched in Germany. Laundry detergent formulations that deliver superior cleaning in cold water, reducing energy usage, saving money and extending garment lifespans for consumers. Third, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision-making. Increased digitization on manufacturing lines, more use of AI, more use of blockchain are not ends in to themselves. There are tools we can use to delight consumers and customers at the most reasonable cost possible. Fourth, our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. By definition, this must include equality. To deliver a superior employee value equation, there must be something in it for everyone. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority and reducing cost to enable investment to value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. The operational costs and currency challenges we faced over the last two years will continue in fiscal '23. We began the new fiscal year with consumers facing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years. We know one of the most pressing questions out there is how we plan to deal with the severe cost and currency impacts we're facing: $6.5 billion after tax in just two years, nearly an $8 billion hit to operating profit. I'll repeat what I said on our April 2020 earnings call: the best response to uncertainties and challenges we face is to double down on the integrated set of strategies that are delivering very strong results. It won't be easy. There will be bumps along the road, but we have the portfolio, superiority, productivity and in my not-so-humble opinion, the best organization in the world. We have everything we need. So again, I think we are very well positioned. We're committed to keep investing to strengthen the superiority of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity to deliver superior value for consumers in every price tier in which we compete. Alongside our productivity work, we'll continue to offset a portion of the cost impacts with price increases. Whenever possible, we'll close a couple of those price increases with innovation. Those moves will be tailored to the market, category and brand. As consumers face increased pressure on nearly every aspect of their household budgets, we invest to deliver truly superior value in combination of price and product performance to earn their loyalty every day. So far, elasticities in most categories where we've taken price increases have been better than our historical experience. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, and the four focus areas that I mentioned strengthen the execution of that strategy. When all of this is executed well, we grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These integrated strategies are a pathway to delivering balanced growth. We've been talking about the importance of balance for a long time in the context of needing both top line and bottom line growth to deliver value for shareowners. We're in a world that needs more from us now. We need to expand that concept to serve and delight consumers, customers, employees, society and our shareowners. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do any of those, we will fail to do all of them. Our consumers increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also a wonderful opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow our categories and create more value, all while positively impacting the environment and society. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain at the right strategic framework as we move forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2023. The macroeconomic and market-level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. I just want to add one thing to that. Agree with everything that Andre said, both due to base period dynamics across ourselves and our competitive set and, as you said, Dara, due to many dynamics that are impacting both top and bottom line as we move forward. There will likely be more volatility in the numbers. There will be some bumps along the road. And you'll have to be careful how much you read into any one-week or four-week period. We've got our eyes focused on a longer time period than that, and we'll be managing accordingly. Let me just start in response to that question, Lauren, and then kick it over to Andre. We need to keep coming back to the strength of the top line. So in the U.S., for example, we grew 6% in the quarter, 8% over the course of the year. As you know, 7% total company, both on the year and the quarter. And that strength is broad-based. That's important. And we continue to protect project top line growth as well as modest share growth going forward. I'll ask Andre to provide specific commentary on China. And Lauren, relative to your question on the relative share performance, where you happen to have manufacturing operations located has a big impact on your ability to supply the market. And we had -- we were pretty significantly impacted by the location of some of the shutdowns, namely Shanghai, where we have manufacturing centers and important contract manufacturer supply. So that's one of the reasons for some of the noise within the share comparison. Just one additional point, Rob, the -- relative to the competitive environment. We're seeing price increases on private label brands and on mid-tier offerings that are even higher in some cases than our own price increases. I just offer that perspective as it relates to the ability to hold pricing and what it might mean for market share. As Andre said, it's a fairly constructive environment. There's clearly a desire to recognize extraordinary effort and results on the part of our organization broadly defined. The challenges that have been overcome while maintaining or improving service to consumers, customer and delivering both strong top and bottom line results, that's just not an accident. And we've been trying to become even more intentional about the importance of our organization, of our employee value proposition and delivering and sustaining superiority over time. So it's just, Bill, a reflection of that reality and my confidence in this organization to continue to step up and step forward into the challenges we face and continue to deliver strong progress from a business standpoint. Great. Thanks for joining us this morning. Just one item to note before we sign off. We will be hosting an Investor Day here in Cincinnati on the afternoon and evening of Thursday, November 17. We'll be sending out another save-the-date reminder in the next week. But if you like more details, please get in touch with the IR team. Thanks and have a great day and weekend."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '22 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '23 and then take your questions. Fiscal 2022 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies continues to yield strong sales, earnings and cash results in an incredibly difficult operating environment. We delivered broad-based strong top line growth across categories and regions, earnings growth in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong return of cash to P&G shareowners. Organic sales for the fiscal grew 7%, up 13% on a two-year stack, up 19% on a three-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew 20%. Fabric Care and Feminine Care grew double digits; Baby Care, up high single digits; Oral Care and Grooming, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care, Skin and Personal Care and Family Care each grew low singles; Focus Markets were up 5% for the year; Enterprise Markets, 10%. We delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 8%, up 16% on a two-year stack. E-commerce sales increased 11%, now representing 14% of company total. Our integrated strategies continue to drive strong market growth, and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 6% in fiscal '22. P&G value share continued to grow, up 90 basis points for the year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share grew 3% for the year despite a 22 percentage point headwind to earnings from commodities, freight and foreign exchange. Our initial outlook predicted $1.8 billion after tax of headwinds. We ended up at $3.2 billion. So despite an incremental $1.4 billion of earnings pressure versus ingoing plan, we delivered core EPS growth within our initial guidance range for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 5%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 93%. We increased our dividend by 5% and returned nearly $19 billion of value to shareowners, $8.8 billion in dividends and $10 billion in share repurchase. Moving to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 7%. Pricing contributed 8 points to organic sales growth as additional price increases reached the market. Mix was flat and volume declined 1 point, which is due to reduced operations in Russia. Volume for the balance of the business excluding Russia was up 1 point. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Nine of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew mid-teens; Fem Care was up low teens; Fabric Care grew double digits; Oral Care, up high singles; Baby Care and Family Care, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care and Grooming, each grew low singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with Focus Markets up 3% and Enterprise Markets up 18% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%, up 24% on a three-year stack. European Focus Markets were up 3%. Excluding Russia, Europe Focus Markets were up 7%. Greater China organic sales were down 11%, mainly due to COVID-driven lockdowns in major regions of the market. Since lockdowns have eased, we've seen sequential market recovery but somewhat slower than expected when we gave guidance last quarter. In Enterprise Markets, each of the three regions grew organic sales 14% or more. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.21, up 7% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 12%. Core operating margin decreased 30 basis points as gross margin pressure were largely offset by sales leverage and productivity improvements in SG&A. Currency-neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Free cash flow productivity was 99%. We returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, nearly $2.3 billion in dividends and nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year, organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, strong performance in very difficult operating conditions. Now I'll pass it over to Jon. Thank you, Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past two years, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead. This rings true again as we enter fiscal 2023. The combined year-on-year profit headwinds from foreign exchange rates, freight costs, materials, fuel, energy and wage inflation are an even greater challenge in fiscal '23 than they were in fiscal '22. Based on current spot prices and supply contracts, we estimate commodities, raw materials and packaging material costs to be a $2.1 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs are expected to be higher in fiscal '23 compared to the average cost paid in fiscal '22 by roughly $300 million after tax. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us even since our presentation at the Deutsche Bank Conference in June. We now expect foreign exchange to be a $900 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at $3.3 billion after tax, roughly equal to the challenge we faced in fiscal '22, a 23 percentage point headwind to EPS growth or roughly $1.33 per share as we start the year. As Jon said in his review of our strategies, we're working to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds through a combination of innovation to create and extend the superiority of our brands, productivity in all aspects of our work, and pricing. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 3% to 4% with strong price contribution offset by modest decreases in unit volume. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow at or above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal '23. On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus fiscal '22 EPS of $5.81. This guidance equates to a range of $5.81 to $6.05 per share, $5.93 or up 2% at the center of the range. Considering a 6-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 6% to 10% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. There are many possible scenarios that could cause us to be outside of this range to either side, high or low. While it's relatively easy to envision many possible scenarios, steeper inflation, deep recession, further geopolitical disruption or commodity cost reversion easing inflation, peaceful conflict resolution, it's very difficult to assign probability to any single scenario. As a result, we set the range we feel is most probable based on market conditions as we see them today. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes a step-up in capital spending as we begin to add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock. Combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Yes. Our core EPS guidance, as I said, in the range of flat to plus 4% with a tax rate slightly higher than what we've seen in the previous fiscal year. This is driven by geographic mix changes, and it's also driven by reduced benefit from stock option redemption. From an operating profit standpoint, you're in the right ballpark. And I would leave it at that. Good morning, Steve. On productivity, you're right, it has to be a significant contributor to how we offset the inflationary cost impacts and enable reinvestment in the business in combination with pricing and innovation, as we said before. In fiscal '22, maybe let's go by area. From a cost of goods productivity standpoint, we've talked about us prioritizing production of cases to ship them and innovation as we were capacity-constrained. That has limited our ability to get cost savings qualified and through the P&L. That is changing in this current fiscal year. As the capacity situation eases, as we add more capacity and catch up with demand, we are able to get more cost savings qualified, catch up on some of the cost savings we delayed in fiscal '22. So we are expecting growth savings in the COGS area to get back to pre-COVID levels in this fiscal year. We are very confident in our teams. They are -- have an unlimited number of creative ideas to drive further productivity. That still obviously is needed to offset inflation, which is equally strong in the fiscal year. From a media standpoint, we have delivered significant productivity over the past years, but we have reinvested all of that productivity and incremental media spend ahead of sales leverage, ahead of the productivity numbers even that we generated. And that productivity continues to strengthen. We have developed strong capability to target better both on TV as well as in digital. Our ability to improve effectiveness of reach and quality of reach is allowing us to drive cost per effective reach down both in digital and in TV. We've shifted more and more spend into digital. Now more than 50% of our advertising is in digital. And with that, we are rolling out these capabilities to more and more businesses and more and more regions. That allows us to increase productivity on media spend in the current fiscal year to the point where we believe we will use some of that productivity not to reinvest fully but to actually flow through and help offset inflation. And some of that you saw in Q4 combined with other effects. General sales leverage and productivity on SG&A driven by sales leverage is well intact. You saw it flow through in quarter 4. That was 180 basis points helped to operating margin, and that should continue. So in summary, I feel good about our productivity muscle. It continues to strengthen, and it will be needed to help offset some of the inflationary pressures we see. On product mix, we continue to see the same effect that we've seen in previous quarters, which is a negative impact to gross margin, roughly 130 basis points on the quarter, positive impact when you think about our portfolio. What we see is that consumers that come into the P&G portfolio and we had big success in driving trial over the past two years. Those consumers, if they try P&G products, they tend to trade up. And that trade-up comes with increased unit sales. It comes with increased penny profit, but the gross margin is slightly dilutive. The example we use generally is Tide pods, about a 50% premium in unit sales versus liquid detergent per load, significantly higher unit profit, but from a gross margin percentage standpoint, slightly lower. So that same effect continues, and we expect that trade-up, hopefully, to continue in this fiscal. Yes. Thanks, Dara. You're right. Our top line guidance is, as always, grounded in what we expect in the marketplace. We see moderation -- or we expect moderation in the overall value growth in the market from the 5% we had over the past 12 months back to 3% to 4%. And we expect pricing to be the main driver in that market growth with volumes slightly down. That is a logical consequence of the broad-based pricing that we are seeing in the market, assuming there will be elasticity. We've seen elasticity, albeit better than expected based on historical levels, but we're seeing elasticity in the market, and that's reflected in our market growth assumption. We have full confidence in our ability to compete in this environment. Our categories being daily-use categories that consumers don't deselect even when they see high levels of inflation, our focus on Irresistible Superiority, our ability to make strong value claims based on that superiority, the breadth of our portfolio across the price letter and value tiers and across channels positions us well to compete in the environment. And most importantly, the strength in our innovation portfolio and the runway we have in driving household penetration and trade-up within the portfolio has us focused really on driving market growth. And that inherently drives share growth for us. That's part of our assumption to market size and relative share growth. As to the private label point, we see private label reemergence in some categories, mainly in the paper categories in some regions. Broadly, what I would tell you at this point, while we acknowledge private label coming back, partly due to supply dynamics in the base, we are still able to grow share in those markets where we see private label coming back. In the U.S. in the recent period, private label coming up a little bit in Family Care. But overall, we've been able to drive share growth on an all-outlet basis. In Europe, private label shares are stronger. Private labels are reemerging in some of the markets. But for example, in the UK and France and Germany, we all have positive share reads in the most recent period. So we're keeping a close eye on it. But again, I want to bring it back to the strategy, the portfolio, the superiority, the innovation, and we believe we are well positioned and continue to be well positioned to serve the consumer in this environment. Very good. Hey, Lauren, on the -- maybe I'll start quickly with the U.S. share, if you let me. You're right. If you look at the past one week and past four weeks, we see a kind of 10 basis point, 20 basis point decline. And that's -- as Jon said, there will be wobbles along the way. The base period is extremely volatile. If you look at absolute shares in the U.S., we're up over the last 52 weeks, last 13 weeks to the last one week, we continue to increase absolute shares. If you look at the periods that you're reading at the moment, just to give a bit more color, the two businesses that are down over this period are Fabric Care and Family Care. Just to give color on the period effects here and the wobbles. Fabric Care had an amazing run in the U.S., 11% up on the quarter, 12% up for the year and high tier -- low teens up over the past two years. And we haven't kept up with capacity and that came to a head in March. Just as we are installing and starting up new capacity, we were supply-constrained over the AMJ quarter. So we reduced merch investment, we reduced media investment because we just didn't have the cases. That is fixed in July. We're back in full supply as we started up new capacity, merchants reinstated, media reinstated. Family Care-based period, you know the situation in Family Care on supply has been very constrained. And again, you're reading mainly base period effects, not sequential share effects. All-outlet share in the U.S. continues to be up. So we feel very confident in our U.S. business overall. China, you're right. We have been significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns. The read for us across our category footprint and regional footprint in China is that the market contracted double digits over the quarter periods that we're reading, and that is reflected in the results. More importantly, since consumer mobility started to resume, the COVID lockdowns are easing, we're seeing a return to growth in our categories. Our shares are responding favorably. So we're hopeful that we return to mid-single-digit growth in China over the next few quarters. Certainly, the team on the ground is excited, capable and has everything ready to go, but we need to see that consumer mobility come back. The -- it's a combination of what you described. As we said, pricing generally comes with a level of elasticity. Consumers don't leave the category, but they might look at their dosing behaviors. They might look a little bit closer at their inventories and draw that down over a period of time, specifically as they are more exposed to inflation broadly in the marketplace with the highest inflation in 40 years, it'd be naive to assume the consumer is not looking at their cash outlay and their spending even in our categories. Though we see the elasticities be more favorable than historical norms to date, we continue our assumption that they return to historical elasticities going forward. We hope that's not the case, but our assumption is that, that returns to what we've seen in the past. The other element I would point to is just normalization of consumption patterns. As we saw very elevated consumption growth over the last two years, some of that will, at a total market level probably return to more normal levels. Our job within that is for our brands and our categories to drive the household penetration opportunities, which we have. They are huge even in the most developed markets, even in the most developed categories, and that's what we're going to focus on. Yes. Kevin, I'll start, and then Jon might want to add here. In general, we acknowledge -- as you said, Walmart indicated that the pressure they are seeing is in general merchandise and apparel. Our categories, when you think about the HPC categories broadly in Walmart and across all retailers in the U.S., really are still growing at a good clip. Our interests are generally aligned with retailers' interest as our job is to provide the best possible value to consumers as defined by price and performance of the product. We both want to drive footfall to the store. We both want to drive traffic to the shelf. We both want to drive consumption of our propositions. In that sense, we continue to work constructively with Walmart and with all retailers to do that in the best possible way. Our strategy, grounded in the categories we play in, that are generally not categories that consumers deselect even in difficult times, our superiority, our investment in innovation, our intention to drive category growth and to win with our retailers versus purely focusing on share growth, all of those are good things. In our mind, all of those are good things in the minds of retailers. The dialogue generally remains constructive but focused on providing the best possible value to the consumer. The increases we're taking, and we've announced in June, July, are going into effect broadly in this quarter, July, August, September, towards the latter half of it. They are across most categories in the U.S. And we also announced pricing globally in the same ballpark, mid-single digits, but very differentiated. So in general, I would tell you, mid-singles -- probably mid- to high singles, but really tailored by country, by brand, by SKU to ensure that we do what I just described retailers are looking for, provide the best value for their relevant shoppers in terms of absolute price point, product performance and value tier. The reaction to those price increases from a retailer environment is what you would expect. Nobody is pleased about the continued inflationary trends that we're seeing, but it remains a constructive discussion on how to best execute what we need both from a retailer standpoint and from a manufacturer standpoint, which is recovery of inflationary cost measures to the extent that cannot be covered by productivity. In terms of our ability to offset the latest inflationary trends across commodities and transportation, pricing is part of that. But the pricing we're taking is not covering the entire breadth of increases that we're seeing that needs to be a combined effort between pricing, innovation and driving trade-up via innovation and productivity. But we feel good about every part of that equation. Our innovation portfolio is stronger than ever. Our productivity muscle is strong, and pricing dynamics and conversations remain productive. Good morning, Kaumil. Yes. If you break it down, the $1.33, $2.1 billion of the $3.3 billion is driven by commodities, $900 million by FX and $300 million by transportation. On the commodity side -- so let me take each bucket here. On the commodity side, we've seen some of our commodities annualized, as you said, and maybe even decrease. But we've seen the majority of our commodity basket still increase week-over-week month-over-month. So when you look at our overall commodity exposure, it is at this point in time stable to increasing. And our assumption going forward is at spot rates. So we assume stability within the commodity price environment versus current spot. We do not hedge our commodities. We are counting on our offsets within our total exposure between commodity FX and interest rates. So spot is the assumption we are using. And we still see slight increases week-over-week, month-over-month, certainly not to the tune that we saw at the beginning of '22. On the foreign exchange rate, that is the fastest-increasing headwind, also a big headwind in quarter 4 that we had to overcome. The interest rate differentials keep widening versus the U.S. So we anticipate that headwind could further expand. But our forecast is based on current spot rate, so the same methodology as on commodities. Transportation is a rollover versus the average price that we have paid in '21, '22. We see a little bit of easing here on the rate side. If you look at the load-to-driver ratio in the U.S., for example, that's down from a peak of 12 to now 4, which is more normalized. And some of the spot rates are coming down. That hasn't rolled over into contract rates at this point in time. If that happens, that could be a tailwind. Ocean freight, you see the number of ships waiting to get unloaded is decreasing. So that's normalizing. What I'll offer as the offset obviously is energy prices, fuel prices. So this one might offer some relief. But again, so far, we see this offset by fuel cost. Good morning, Chris. On the promo side, I'm not sure we intended to mention any number. But let me describe where we are. But John Chevalier can certainly clarify afterwards, if that question remains open. Our promotion strategy remains the same. If you look at promotion levels, they are relatively stable. I take the U.S. as the market where we have the best visibility and you have the best visibility. We're running at about 27% of merch, so that's volume sold on deal, and depth combined. That compares to a pre-COVID level slightly above 30% to a COVID low at 16%. But that 27% has been relatively stable over the past few quarters. So there's no significant increase in what we're observing. We are not planning to increase significantly. But that, again, is a very tactical decision that is being made at the market level at the category level. But our intention to win is via innovation via clarity of value offer, via our superiority, not via price promotion. Good morning, Andrea. On revenue growth management, that has been a priority for us, not only in the recent quarter but really over the past two to three years. So what we're benefiting from now was very intentional design of our revenue growth strategies over that period of time, including portfolio choices to have brand offerings available that cover different value tiers. When you think about diapers, for example, we have the premium-tier Pampers Pure at $0.38 per diaper, Swaddlers at about $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20 a diaper. So that's one example. And this exists across really all brands. And we've been very intentional in building our presence in these different value tiers in the market, so we can serve consumers with different preferences between performance and price. We have also spent a lot of time and design effort in creating the right price points. And those price points relevant on everyday price but also providing the right merch price points for different channels. So that's work that's been going on in every category. And then lastly, we've expanded our distribution across channels that consumers would go to in a more value-driven environment, think about hard discounters or dollar channel, to ensure that we have strong relationships with our retail partners there, strong distribution and offerings. So that work, yes, is indeed very important, but it has been ongoing over a longer period of time. As we take pricing, we ensure that we protect that strategy very carefully. And that's why pricing is so differentiated between markets, brands, channels as we execute. On Beauty China, what I'll tell you is that we remain very confident that the Chinese market offers very attractive growth rates and very attractive value-creation opportunities for us. As mobility returns, as department stores reopen, as we develop stronger capability in digital channels, as we refocus our business on the core brand equities, we see progress. The progress is still relatively slow because mobility is only just reopening. But we remain very confident that, that business offers a lot of opportunity, and we are well positioned with our brands to play. Hey, Olivia. On pricing, my answer is going to be quick. What's announced is announced, and everything else we can't talk about. But it's going to be a combination of pricing, productivity and innovation. That's as much as I can tell you. And we're always evaluating pricing and the necessity for pricing in every market every day. So that's an ongoing discussion. In terms of innovation, fundamentally, our innovation pipeline looks out five years, 10 years. The innovation pipeline continues to be strong. It continues to drive superiority across the full portfolio because that's the definition of superiority. It's not just the premium end, and that doesn't really change. So when we talk Irresistible Superiority, we mean Irresistible Superiority at every price point for every product, for every consumer that we choose to compete for versus the relevant competitive offering. And that drives the innovation strategy and the strength of the innovation. I see it only improving and being broad-based. Thanks, Mark. On SG&A leverage, so from a -- let me maybe start with the broader leverage point. So we generally see sales leverage when we see growth in the range of 3% to 4%, roughly. When we go north of 4%, the leverage becomes relevant and material, and that's SG&A leverage. So if we grow in line with our guidance range, that will provide a level of sales leverage similar to what we would typically and historically have expected. On the COGS side, you're right, the volume is the key driver for the leverage. With flat volumes, as we've seen in the fourth quarter, there obviously is no leverage. But that's where our productivity efforts are even more important. And that's why we're doubling down on our acceleration of productivity improvements. We'll talk about this more, I think, in our Investor Day, where we'll give you a bit more insight on Supply Chain 3.0 just to put more substance around the runway that we still have in driving productivity. That also is the answer to your second question because you're right, foreign exchange rate represents a significant headwind for us, might not represent that much of a headwind for some of our international competitors. We're well aware of that. We've been to this movie a few times. The answer to our question is strong growth, serving the consumer better than everybody else, delivering top line growth. That fuels our ability to invest in combination with strong productivity. So it reinforces our growth model. It reinforces the need for all components of the strategy to work. But I acknowledge foreign exchange rate is one of the more discriminating headwinds we have to deal with."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We will keep prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. This was another strong quarter, strong top line growth across categories and regions, sequential earnings growth progress in the face of significant and still increasing cost headwinds. Starting with a few highlights on the March quarter. Organic sales grew 10%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth. Pricing added 5 points as additional price increases began to reach the market. Mix added 2 points to sales growth for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew more than 30%. Fabric Care was up low-teens. Baby Care and Feminine Care grew double digits. Oral Care and Grooming up high singles. Home Care and Family Care up mid-single digits. Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low singles. Focus markets grew 9%, and enterprise markets were up 12%. In focus markets, US organic sales were up 11% on 7% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, US organic sales up 18%. Focus markets in Europe were up 10% and Asia Pacific, up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down mid-single digits versus a comp period that was up 22%. Market conditions continued to soften in the March quarter due to COVID-driven lockdowns. In enterprise markets, Europe grew 18%; Latin America, up 16%; and Asia Middle East Africa grew 8%. Broad-based growth across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales high singles or better. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the US categories in which we compete grew nearly 9% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow, up 1 point versus same quarter last year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12-month period in the US and globally. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands, recognizing the superior performance and value. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.33, up 6% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 10%. Within the EPS results, we estimate Ukraine, Russia was a negative impact of about $0.01 per share. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points, and currency neutral core gross margin was down 380 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 490 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 130 basis point headwind, mainly from product form and pack size mix impact. Pricing and productivity savings of 260 basis points partially offset the gross margin headwinds. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 380 basis points due to strong top line leverage. Advertising investments remain strong as we continue to communicate the superiority and value of P&G offerings across price tiers. Core operating margin decreased 10 basis points. Currency neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Productivity improvements were 170 basis points helped to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 74% as receivables and inventories increased due to strong sales results. We returned $3.4 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners, many of whom rely on the steady, reliable income earned with their P&G investment. This is the [66th] (ph) consecutive annual dividend increase and 132nd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. So three quarters into the fiscal, organic sales up nearly 7% on broad-based growth across categories and geographies, solid global value share growth, sequentially improving EPS growth, strong cash productivity and an increased income commitment to owners of P&G shares. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down on our efforts to delight consumers. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation; a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. This drives value creation for our retail partners and build market share for P&G brands. Noticeable superiority is perhaps the most important in the inflationary environment we are potentially facing. A great example is the formula innovation we've launched on Tide and Ariel laundry detergents to enable superior cleaning performance in cold water washing. We're strengthening the communication of the cost benefits to consumers and the environmental benefits for the planet on the package and in our advertising. For consumers, the savings from switching from hot to cold washing can nearly offset the cost of Tide or Ariel liquid detergent in each load. The superior cold water performance is strong competitive advantage, enables immediate energy cost savings for our consumers and avoids the cost of rewashing, which may be necessary with less effective detergents. In addition, washing with cold water improves sustainability by reducing the energy required to heat water in the process and by improving garment lifespans. Superior innovation delivering multiple benefits and improved value for consumers, even while we price to offset a portion of the cost increases we are absorbing. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chain and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases. We closed a couple of price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investments to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We are committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of our strategies. Leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce costs and enable rapid and efficient decision-making, next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapted to a new reality. And our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicity, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and to develop the best talent. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority in reducing cost to enable investment and value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move forward. Moving on to guidance. We said each quarter that we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. We've seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us. Transportation and labor markets remain tight. Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and markets. Inflationary cost pressures are broad-based and continue to increase with little sign of near-term relief and have resulted in consumer price increases across CPG categories and beyond. The recent spike in virus cases in China and resulting lockdowns are affecting consumption and have caused temporary work stoppages in our operations and those of our suppliers. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to their impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution excellence have positioned us well to manage through these challenges over time. Based on the current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.5 million after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Since our last update, we've seen continued cost increases in nearly every type of material we use and in diesel and in natural gas. Freight costs have continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be a $400 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. Foreign exchange rate has also moved further against us, since our last guidance. We now expect FX to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We are offsetting a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. In the start of the fiscal year, we've taken price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the US. You may recall, it was one year ago, when we announced price increases in the Feminine Care and Baby Care categories. Over the last year, input costs have continued to increase substantially. And as a result, the Feminine Care business has announced an additional price increase in the US, which will be effective in mid-July. Also, as a result of these increased cost headwinds, we recently announced price increases on certain items in the US Home Care category that will be effective at the end of June and in the US Oral Care business that will be effective mid-July. As always, each category in each market is continually assessing the cost impacts they face and the potential need for pricing. If there are decisions to price, the degree and timing of those moves will be very specific to the category, the brand and sometimes to the individual SKU. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Also, just as we've done over the past year, we'll look to close a couple of price increases with new innovation that offers our consumers more value, continue to drive category growth and maintain our competitive superiority advantage. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to key guidance metrics. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 6% to 7% for the fiscal year, a two-point increase versus our prior guidance of 4% to 5%. Pricing was a sequentially stronger contributor to top line growth in the third quarter and will continue to be a driver again in the fourth quarter as we get the full effect of increases taken over the past few months. We are closely monitoring consumption trends for signs of changes. So far, elasticities have been in line or better than our expectations. Demand for our best-performing, premium-priced offerings remain strong as do our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're maintaining the core earnings per share growth range of 3% to 6%. But given cost challenges we're facing, we now expect to be at the low end of the range at 3%. Within this guidance, we expect an additional $0.04 per share of negative impact in the fourth quarter from higher costs and limited operations in Ukraine and Russia. The impact from commodities, freight and foreign exchange has increased significantly since the start of the fiscal year. Our initial guidance in July assumed $1.8 billion after tax or about $0.70 a share. This increased to $2.3 billion in our October outlook, $2.8 billion in January, now a $3.2 billion after-tax headwind to fiscal 2022 earnings. On an EPS basis, the headwinds are now approximately $1.26 a share or a 22% headwind to core EPS. So in the face of an incremental $0.56 per share of negative cost impact since the start of the year, we've held our going-in EPS range, and we've maintained strong investment superiority with new product innovation and fully funded advertising programs. Of note, the majority of the recent $400 million increase in cost and foreign exchange headwinds will impact us in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95% for the year. We continue to expect to pay $8 billion in dividends and now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions and store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, our business continues to exhibit strong momentum. And we believe P&G is well positioned to grow through and beyond the immediate issues we are facing. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and market volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much and good morning. Andre, curious this quarter's revenue numbers surely show that there isn't really much that's happening in the way of trade down, and you just commented on elasticity. But I just was curious kind of what, if anything, P&G is doing to prepare for what feels like an inevitability for consumers becoming more sensitive to the pricing that is prevalent not just in your products, but across everything that they need to buy. So anything that you guys are doing proactively to help mitigate or think ahead to when trade down or substitution may become more of a factor? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Sure, morning, Lauren. Yeah, so as you said, in the data at this point, we continue to see favorable price elasticities relative to historic elasticities we've observed. Elasticities are better by about 20% to 30% versus what historical data would have indicated. That's good. But looking forward, we certainly have our eyes wide open and watch for any change in terms of consumer behavior. And as we say, we prepare on multiple fronts. I think the first level of protection here is the portfolio we've chosen to play in. We've moved out of discretionary categories into categories that are daily use, health- and hygiene-focused, where performance truly drive brand choice. That allows us to continue to invest in superiority, which we are doing consistently. Even though we see cost pressures, we continue to invest in superiority in every category and every proposition. That is probably the best protection. And consumers are rewarding us with continued trade-in and continuous trade up, which you see in the share numbers to date. The superiority also allows us to translate product superiority, for example, into value superiority more directly for the consumers. So that's the second intervention I would describe. So we are more proactively turning true product superiority into value claims that we put on tech, use in our advertising. One example is the Ariel cold -- Ariel and Tide cold water wash that I have mentioned in the prepared remarks. There are other innovations like the ADW, the automatic dishwasher myth buster, stating that even with eight dishes, it's more efficient to use the dishwasher than cleaning the dishes under running water, the latest easy squeeze innovation on Dawn that allows the consumer to use every last drop without any compromise on performance. So those are examples that we're turning into value plays to have consumers understand more easily the value that is coming by using P&G propositions. We have intentionally built price levels in every brand and across brands to ensure that we have offerings for consumers. If they feel they are budget constrained, they can trade within the P&G brand offerings. So on diapers, we have multiple offerings, starting with Pampers Pure at about $0.40 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20. These price ladders exist in all categories and offer the consumer a choice within the P&G portfolio. We are also, which is part of our pricing execution, protecting key price points, key value price points for each offering. So consumers can choose different cash outlays as they shop based on their available cash at the moment of shopping. The last element, we intentionally built distribution across all channels and invested in all channels. And that includes channels that consumers that are more budget constrained would migrate to like hard discounters in Europe, like the dollar channel in the U.S., for example. So building distribution across those channels to be able to serve the consumer where they want to shop is the last element I would call out. So, all of those leave us in a better position than we've ever been to deal with the potential consumer that is more budget constrained. To-date, we're not seeing that come through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everybody, and thanks for taking the question. So my question is about just the, I guess, the path to stabilizing gross margins in particular. And I guess if we look at the quarter, right, the pricing and productivity covered about half of the inflation, so if you take the mix effect out of gross margins. And so, I guess, as we're modeling going forward, what are the levers that are going to -- that we should look to, to stabilize gross margins? Will there be a lot more incremental pricing? I know you've talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks, a step-up in productivity. Just trying to understand what the levers are going to be as we kind of look forward over the next couple of quarters on gross margins.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thanks. Morning, Bryan. You're right. Over the past three quarters, you see pricing and productivity continue to increase a bigger portion of the commodity, foreign exchange and T&W gross margin impact. In quarter one, this covered 37%. In quarter two, we covered, I believe, 43%, and now we're at 53%. So you see a bigger portion being covered over time\u2013 [via] (ph) those effects. We will continue to drive all three levers to recover the dollar impact of commodity cost increases, foreign exchange and T&W. Productivity will continue to play a significant role. We have a lot of runway left on productivity. And as the supply situation stabilizes here over time, we have more line time and more resources available to reinvest in cost of goods savings. And that will allow us to strengthen our productivity muscle here sequentially, hopefully, over the next few quarters. We will continue to drive innovation. We have prioritized innovation in our resource and line time allocation to ensure that we can continue to offer superior value to our consumers, which also enables us to take pricing and see these relatively benign elasticities at this point in time. So you continue to see us invest in innovation. With innovation, we will try to take pricing at a very granular level by market, by brand. A lot of the price increases that we have announced are yet to flow through. So you will see an incremental contribution to the top line and to gross margin recovery over the future. The other price increase is already announced, and we will have to carefully evaluate more opportunities to take pricing. It will take time to recover the full dollar impact. And as we said before, it's more important to us to support the business model, support innovation, support superiority, execute pricing in the right way and recover gross margin and cost impact over time versus rushing to do this faster. So, you should expect sequential progress. I won't give you a specific timeline. We will continue to use all three, productivity, innovation and pricing.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning. I was hoping to get a bit more detail on China. How much of the decline in the quarter do you think was specifically related to lockdowns and maybe the comp versus last year? And can you give us a bit more granularity on some of the performance by product category there? And any thoughts on China going forward with the continued lockdowns in April, and how the business is positioned going forward? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. Look, China, the lockdowns had two impacts in China for us. One, on the supply side, we have two plants in the Shanghai area and the contract manufacturer. Those obviously were shut down for now an extended period of time. So we had to activate our business continuity plans to offset as much of that production impact as we could. And we're certainly seeing a significant impact in terms of consumer demand. About 25%, I think, was the Wall Street estimates of consumers are somehow impacted by lockdown. That is impacting our consumers' ability to reach stores, grocery stores, department stores. Even online shopping is significantly constrained due to the inability to deliver. So we certainly see a significant impact from lockdowns. Latest read of market size in our categories over the past three months through March was flat in terms of value in China. With the continued lockdown and the difficulties in the market, we would expect April to be flat to negative. In terms of category detail, Beauty is significantly exposed to China. As you know, a bigger part of Beauty is -- of the Beauty business is in China. SK-II continues to be under pressure due to the market effect and channel effects in China. So that dynamic has not changed. The longer-term story on China based on historical results, which has been extremely strong over the past three, four years, as you know, we've grown high singles, low doubles in China. We believe the market continues to be a very attractive market for us. We expect categories to return to mid-single, high singles growth. We have a very strong organization, a very strong supply chain, a very strong R&D organization in China. So we remain confident, and we will continue to invest to capture the growth in the future.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you, very much. Just a point of clarification to start off. Can you tell us kind of what your pricing run rate was at the end of the quarter, given that the pricing was going in throughout the quarter and the year? I think you were at 5% on average, but just like to get a sense of what the run rate was. And then I'd like to dig in a little bit more on the state of the consumer. You mentioned that elasticities were 20% to 30% better than what history has shown. But the current conditions, we've never had these kind of current conditions before at least in anybody's recent memory. So I was wondering what your consumer panels are telling you about why the elasticities are better? Is it because of increased savings? Is it the low rates of unemployment? How much has maybe contributed to your superiority? Just trying to get a little bit better sense of your read on the consumer from your own internal research? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Okay. Thanks, Robert. So in terms of pricing run rate for the quarter, on average, we have a five point contribution to top line. As we said, pricing will continue to increase as more of the price increases flow through. So I would say exiting the quarter, I would see about a 6% run rate to top line from pricing contribution. So you will see more of the pricing that has been announced, and that will flow through in April for the flow through in quarter four. Pricing elasticities remain favorable. And within the portfolio that we offer to consumers, we broadly see a trade up into higher price propositions that offer better value and better product performance. So \u2013 and that explains the mix effect that you see in gross margin, where we see higher unit sales items being chosen with higher penny profit, but slightly lower gross margin. So consumers are trading into single unit dose detergents instead of liquid detergent. Consumers are trading into body lotions instead of Baby Dry in diapers. So we see consumers trading up even within our portfolio into higher-performing product propositions. The relevancy of \u2013 or the relevance of product performance in our categories, we believe, is the reason why consumers are not trading down. We've had an extensive period of trial during the early COVID phases, where consumers have traded into P&G. They've experienced the superior performance of our propositions. They've seen the relative value that we provide. Even though the cash outlay might be higher, they see the higher efficacy of the product and the benefit that they gain from it. And we've seen repeat rates reaffirming that. We believe that a good portion of the resiliency of our demand is driven by the superiority of the product and packaging, clear communication of the benefits basis, clear communication of the value, good retail execution and carefully crafted price increases that allow consumers to choose the cash outlay they feel ready to afford and to choose the brand and brand proposition that they are looking for. So I'll leave it at that.\nJon Moeller: Hey, Robert, this is Jon. Just a couple of other pieces of perspective on this, and of course, it's a rapidly evolving situation, and this could change tomorrow. But if you look for data points to support Andre's comments on consumer resilience, you obviously see them within the internals of our income statement as you mentioned. Also, if you look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, they remain below a year ago in the US for the past three, six and 12 months. They remain below a year ago in Europe for the past three, six and 12 months. And if you look at market shares across channels, Andre mentioned earlier that we're -- we've worked to improve our distribution in channels where consumers with more of a budget challenge are inclined to shop. Our share growth in those channels, entirely consistent with his points, are some of our highest share growth across retail banners. So in the dollar channel, for example, significant share growth. Again, we'll have to monitor this very closely. Things can change tomorrow. But as we sit here today, it looks like the moves we've made to focus the portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and deliver on the performance aspect across the vectors of superiority and be very granular in our pricing executions is holding up.\nOperator: All right. Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question relates to category growth rates, understanding the volatility of the environment. And I guess I'm coming at this from the angle, I'm trying to unpack the strength of the 10% organic sales growth in the quarter and just the areas of favorability versus your plan. We've covered a lot of this. Demand elasticity, clearly better. Trade up remains favorable despite the environment. You continue to gain market share, which is great, up 50 basis points globally, though, I'm less certain that degree of market share gain would be very different than your plan. And then we haven't touched on this on the call. I'm not sure maybe there is some degree of inventory rebalancing with the trade because demand has outstripped supply in recent quarters. So where I'm going with this and understand the volatility of the environment, has there been any material change in your view for the categories as you look across your geographies and you look across the categories that you participate in? And we're thinking about our forecast going forward, any material change to category growth rates based on what you're currently seeing? So your comments there would be helpful. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Morning, Kevin. Thank you. So category growth rates are holding up well. Fiscal year-to-date, global category growth in the categories we compete in is 5%. We expect that to continue at around 5%. Category growth in focus markets is 5%. Category growth in enterprise markets is 7%. So it's a strong 5% on a global level. It's fairly consistent. Enterprise markets have been growing past three, six and 12 at 7%. Focus markets have gone between 4% and 5% over the past three, six and 12 months. So if anything, in the most recent reading, we've seen strengthening of category growth. We're also pleased with the fact that we see P&G leading and disproportionately contributing to category growth in most of the markets we're competing in, via innovation and via leading innovation and thereby driving category growth and participating in that category growth via share growth. So overall, we feel good about the level of category growth. We're seeing slight acceleration across the periods P&G contributing via our strategy of driving market growth, via superiority investment and innovation. And that certainly is benefiting our growth and is in line with our growth model we want to drive because the only way to sustainably grow at these level's by driving market growth and then participating in that growth via shared growth.\nJon Moeller: Yes. Market growth is something that doesn't happen to us. We need to positively impact it ourselves, which is exactly what Andre just said. And that's what we're trying to do through our strategy. I would also say, Kevin, that if you look at the last quarter, there are several negatives within the quarter from a top line standpoint, several challenges that we've been working against. We've talked about China, our second-largest market, down mid singles. We've talked about the unfortunate situation in Russia and the Ukraine. One thing we haven't talked about, except indirectly, is that we're still racing to catch up with demand in our largest market, the U.S. But we're not fully supplying the market's demand. And all of those, hopefully, over time or some of them at least offer even additional upside as they reverse themselves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. Just a little bit of a follow-up there. Could you just talk a little bit about where the supply constraints are most acute and where you're starting to see potentially some more capacity coming back across the category, particularly amongst private label players? You mentioned pricing in Feminine Care, Home Care, Oral Care. Can you talk about -- a little bit about your decision as you consider future rounds of price increases and what categories you could potentially -- how you think about what categories you could potentially move on further? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: All right. Morning, Olivia. Supply constraints, maybe to start at the global level, supply constraints are only present in every potential bucket that you can think through. Being able to source raw and materials is still difficult in sufficient quantities. Getting raw and packed materials to the places we need to get them to continues to be costly and highly volatile. Labor availability is certainly a stretch, not for P&G directly, but more for our supplier base. And then getting finished product out to our retailers by being able to actually ship with truck availability in the U.S., for example, is difficult. So it's across all aspects of the supply chain. We are making progress. Our on-shelf availability continues to be stable at around 93%, 94% even as we grow at these levels that we are happy to report we're growing at in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date. We have more and more categories coming off managed supply in the US over the next two months. So we are carefully working with our retail partners to ensure that we do this in the right way to ensure best service and best on-shelf availability with our retail partners. And we're making progress. Heavy -- the most investment in terms of capacity will be in our North America and European markets to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to keep up with increased demand we've seen. Those investments will take hold over the next two years. But we expect to be in a better situation over the next, call it, three to six months, specifically in the US moving out of managed supply. There is no -- to your second part of the question on pricing, I -- there is no formula-based approach to pricing in any of these categories. So we're carefully watching number one, consumer behavior and the strength of our superiority relative to the market. We are looking at the cost pressures and cost headwinds that we are seeing. And you will have noticed that in our paper categories in Fem Care, in Baby Care, in Family Care and in our Fabric & Home Care categories, that's where we see the biggest impact from commodity cost increases, transportation warehouse, but also foreign exchange impacts. So the impacts are bigger. There is superiority, and then it becomes a matter of, do we have the right innovation available, or do we feel that it is right at this point in time to recover via pricing versus leveraging productivity and the balance between those three elements as we've talked before. So I wouldn't say there's any formulaic approach. But certainly, Fabric & Home Care and the paper categories are most exposed to the cost pressures. So, the combination of all three elements needs to play out more aggressively in those categories than maybe in some others. Jon, anything you want to add?\nJon Moeller: No, I think you've covered it. And Olivia, first of all, it\u2019s great to hear your voice again. And obviously, we can't provide any more granularity than Andre already has in terms of where price -- future price increases would occur. That's not something that's legally permissible.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: I guess not to beat a dead horse, but just to follow up on that point, as you think about the priority for the P&L, in those categories, I mean, I look at paper, I look at laundry or fabric. Those are categories where there is just to start with, maybe more competition, maybe less brand loyalty, maybe a little bit more private label just to start with, even though private label may not be gaining share yet. And so I'm wondering, if your priority is to offset commodity headwinds as much as you possibly can to preserve gross margin, or is it to preserve market share at this point? And then relatedly, you haven't really talked that much about currency and what you're doing in some of the bigger emerging markets, not even just emerging markets, but Japan, for example, where currency is a significant headwind. Are you adopting a different stance with regard to taking prices to offset currency headwinds? And are you seeing any differences in elasticity maybe in some of those emerging markets? Thanks so much.\nAndre Schulten: Okay. In terms of priority, our priority remains a reasonable recovery time on the dollar impact of commodities, foreign exchange and T&W headwinds across all categories. We will do this in a way that provides value to the consumer, provides a superior proposition to the consumer by combining it with innovation. There is no time line for us that forces us to recover gross margin over a certain period of time. We want to return to margin expansion, and we will. Our balanced growth model requires us to drive top line, bottom line but also reasonable margin expansion. So there is continued commitment to return to that point, but we will do it in a way that provides the right value to the consumer in every brand in every market at any given point in time, so we can serve consumers in the best way possible and maintain business momentum. To your second question on foreign exchange rate pricing, across markets, foreign exchange rate pricing is a reality we're dealing with every day, we've been dealing with for years. Nothing different to report in terms of elasticities, it's being executed in some markets, more pronounced. You've seen us taking significant price increases, for example, in Turkey, significant price increases in Argentina. So those are being executed. The organizations know very well how to do those, and they are baked in our forecast and guidance.\nJon Moeller: So just one other point, Wendy. You asked \u2013 the question that you asked is the question that we get asked by the organization every day, which is which of these matters most, essentially top line and continued share progression or bottom line and earnings recovery. And the answer always is both. It's Andre's balanced point. We need to do both or we get out of balance, and the wheels come off. So we need to continue, and we'll continue to invest in top line momentum as we recover the commodity costs through combination of pricing, productivity, et cetera. So that's \u2013 it's both.\nOperator: All right. The next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a different slant to the premiumization and trade-down question, not necessarily on trade down, but just slowing momentum of premiumization because during the pandemic, you had a lot of low-income consumers with all that extra stimulus money engaging more in premium price tiers. So I was just curious on your observations on that. Kind of how do you think that's going to manifest in terms of that particular income strata and how they're behaving with food and gas inflation the way it is? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Good morning, Nik, look, we're not seeing it. We've seen consumers trade into P&G brands and trade up within the P&G brand portfolio throughout the pandemic. Every quarter this fiscal year, we've seen consumers continue to trade up within the P&G brand portfolio into higher premium propositions across most categories. That's the mix effect you've seen on the gross margin and the positive mix effect on sales. So we continue to see consumers stay within the P&G portfolio and many consumers actually trading up within the P&G portfolio as they see the benefit of those higher premium propositions. As we've said before, we don't take that for granted. We don't assume that what we're seeing to date is necessarily an indication of what will happen in the future. We are very well aware that consumers might end up looking at budget constraints. Where we see, for example, private label losses reducing, we continue to see P&G growth. So even private label coming back so far is not impacting P&G's ability to grow within those markets or within those market category combinations. Our best defense to serve the consumer in a more budget constrained environment, other point we've talked through from the portfolio focus that we're operating to superiority to value plays, cash outlay choices, price ladder choices, distribution across our channels. So I come back to those elements that we control. That will serve us well, I believe, even for consumers that are more budget constrained and looking for choices.\nJon Moeller: There are a lot of mileage benefits in some of the higher-priced products that we need to proactively communicate, as Andre mentioned earlier. That -- the assumption that just because something is higher priced, it costs me more per job is not a valid assumption, and we have to help people understand that.\nOperator: All right. Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the Personal Health Care business. Organic growth over 30%, certainly impressive. I appreciate there's a dynamic here where there's some recovery from like basically a non-existing cold, flu, but also conscious that this is one of those categories where you're particularly focused, and there's been some innovation. I wonder if you can just comment on how much of the strength in the business which is recovery versus things you're doing a bit more offensively that have a bit more legs long term? And just connected to that, fiscal Q4 implied organic sales guidance is for strength but deceleration on a two-year stack. And I wonder if you're baking in any normalization there or if there's other puts and takes that we should keep in mind? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: All right. Thanks, Chris. PHC had a fabulous quarter, as we point out. Part of that certainly is the stronger cold, cough and flu season. It's 57% stronger in our estimation than last year's season, which was abnormally low driven by the mask mandates and everything else going on, a slightly stronger season than average by about 4%. But importantly, North America Vicks, for example, was able to outpace that season growth, plus 123% growth versus the season, which drove about 1.9 share points over the period. So within respiratory, season recovery is certainly a big point, but mix growing ahead of the season recovery and building share. The growth is also broader than just respiratory. Digestive organic sales are up mid-teens, and fleet is up nearly 30%. So the breadth of the portfolio is performing even beyond just the season recovery. So we continue to be very pleased with the results of the PHC portfolio and certainly see significant future runway there. On quarter four, sales guidance, the only thing I would say is as we mentioned before, we do not assume the favorable price elasticities to hold. In our forecasting, we assume price elasticity is to return to normal levels that we've seen historically. That's the only thing I'll let you know. And the rest, I think, is fairly clear.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I'd like to maybe just follow-up on a comment from earlier on sequential gross margin improvement. Was that a -- just a general comment on something that you expect over time, or are you kind of indicating that gross margins we see today are trough margins in 4Q, and as we get into the beginning of the next fiscal year is when we'll start to see it?\nAndre Schulten: General comment over time, Kaumil. We're not forecasting gross margin or gross margin guidance here, too many moving pieces. But over time, we remain committed to building gross margin as part of the balanced growth model.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask specifically a bit more about Beauty. So volumes negative. I guess I was curious, how much of it is category shift? It seems a bit away from Skin Care given pandemic effect there into some more discretionary categories. How much is market share challenges for SK-II around Asia and China specifically? And how do you think about how much of what I just said could be transitory versus needing more change from your standpoint to improve trends? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're very confident in the Beauty portfolio. If you look at the performance of this portfolio over the past five years, it's been just outstanding, right? The core portfolio has grown sales more than $3 billion over the past five years, profits more than $1 billion, significant shareholder value creation and 26 quarters of uninterrupted growth. So the core portfolio has been performing extremely well. And as you say, there are a number of headwinds that we see as temporary. China and the dynamics in China certainly being one of those significant dynamics, which is impacting the broader Hair Care and Skin Care portfolio, but also the broader impact on SK-II as it comes to the travel retail shutdown during the COVID period and the impact of China on the SK-II consumption with department stores being closed down and even some of the online business being hampered. So there are a number of temporary effects that we see. We -- you have seen us announce a few portfolio additions, acquisitions over the past months that are focused on the premium and super premium segments in the category. We believe that's a growth opportunity beyond the core portfolio in specialty channels. So we've proven that strategy with previous acquisitions like First Aid Beauty. And so we want to build out the portfolio in the premium and super premium segment in addition to restrengthening the core. So there's certainly work to do to address the opportunities in China on the core business, rebuild strength and momentum on SK-II and further help our business to serve premium and super premium consumers and specialty channels in the US and outside the US. But we're very confident in the core focused portfolio and some targeted additions via acquisition that we tucked in, which set us up for future growth in the Beauty category.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hi good morning, everyone. So in the release, there were a few comments around lapping pandemic-related consumption. And I think you called out appliances and cleaning specifically. I just would be curious, when you look at performance in those categories, how does the recent performance compare versus your expectations? I guess what I'm trying to understand is, are you seeing a normalization that is in line with your expectations in some of those categories that saw significant growth over the past couple of years, or has demand held up better or been worse than you would have anticipated?\nAndre Schulten: Yes, I can start Peter, and then maybe Jon wants to add a few points here. But overall consumption is holding up. As I mentioned, market growth, 5% of focus markets, 7% in enterprise markets. That's certainly an indication that overall consumption in all categories is holding up well. There are some natural -- not natural, but logical switches. So when we think about, for example, our Grooming business, the Appliances business has experienced significant growth during the pandemic as more and more jobs that were done in salons and barbershops moved in-house. So folks -- people bought these appliances, experienced the fact that they can do the job themselves, and they continue to do so. But once that need is satisfied, appliances sees a decline versus that peak in terms of incremental job growth and incremental overall growth. At the same time, there's a natural hedge within the Grooming portfolio. So blades and razors were under pressure, as more people work from home and stayed at home. With reopening, that part of the category resumed growth. So there's a hedge component within Grooming, for example. Within anything that is health and hygiene related, I think consumers continue to put more emphasis on jobs to be done. They spend more time at home. So we continue to see our categories to benefit from both effects. Paper towel consumption continues to be increased by more than 10%. We'll see where bath tissue ends up once supply is unconstrained, but more time at home certainly would speak to more in-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. The only part where we saw a little bit of a decline was anything that has to do with household -- surface disinfection, surface cleaning. That's a relatively smaller part of our portfolio. But as consumers get more used to the right balance there, we saw a little bit of a decline. But overall, all categories still benefiting from more time at home and higher focus on health and hygiene and certainly Beauty and Personal Care-related categories benefiting from reopening.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. I was hoping, if you can please comment on the Baby, Feminine Care and Family Care. Seems that you continue to regain share in the US and also potentially in China despite the challenges there. And similar to this question, you had an impressive growth in the cold and flu brand franchises. But you start to lap those comps there. So do you think the growth is still sustainable with the innovation you've made in other franchises in health care? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. So Baby Care share is improving significantly in Europe and in North America driven by major innovation that was launched in the market, both in Europe and in North America. We will continue to build on that share momentum. We will continue to drive superiority via incremental innovation, investment in brand communication, go-to-market execution. We've also been able to enter some new parts and grow some new segments within the Baby Care category. When you think about launches, for example, in North America, that's a category that has been relatively quiet, it serves children between 5 and 12 with all the night bed-wetting issues. And reentering that category with a creative and relevant proposition allowed us to grow the category mid-teens and at the same time, build an 8% -- 8% to 9% share position within the category. We continue to build share in pants. Pants is a trade-up category in Europe and an opportunity in North America that allows us to grow our position as well. So broad innovation in terms of true product innovation, but also new jobs to be done and communication. Fem Care, we are seeing big success in both adult incontinence, but also in the most premium propositions in Fem Care. The biggest growth, for example, in Fem Care pads in North America is driven by Infinity, our most premium proposition, which is a unique proposition from P&G form based pad, delivering superior comfort and absorbency. Again, same formula, significant \u2013 significantly innovating in relevant ways for the consumer, investment in communication, retail execution allows us to drive overall market growth and share growth. On cold and flu, I don't have much more to add, Andrea, versus what we said before. We are growing ahead of the segment in terms of respiratory with strong innovation in Vicks. And we are growing the balance of the portfolio in terms of absolute sales growth and share growth, be it sleep or digestive. So overall, we feel there's significant runway left on our PHC portfolio, and it's playing out in the market.\nOperator: And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much. I give you a lot of credit. I mean, there hasn't been a lot of discussion about retailer pushback to pricing. And maybe that's just because the results are good overall. But just looking at the US market, why is it that your relationships with retailers seem so good that elasticities are better? It's really a consumer level discussion. And do you expect that to continue? Can you give me any color around why that particular -- is it maybe just simply that they're short product, and there's more demand versus supply, so you're kind of in the driver's seat? What allowed this pretty good series of very good relationships to emerge? And what the -- how sustainable do you think that proves if we need another round of significant pricing second half of the year? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: I'll start, and I'm sure Jon has a few points to add here. But generally, discussions with retailers work better if your business comes from a position of strength. Consumers are looking for your propositions. Velocity at shelf is strong. You have innovation programs that are credible and tangible and meaningful for consumers. You have in-store programs that are meaningful for retailers and consumers. You have an ability to communicate and support the advertising, both in digital as well as in mass advertising. And all of those things hold true as we entered this commodity inflation cycle. P&G came from a relatively strong position in terms of superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. Products on shelf, we're doing well. And that sets up a good discussion with retailers about future growth potential, the need for pricing, which is very clear, given the inflation cycle and the reality that it's broad-based within multiple industries. No guarantee that, that will continue. It will also -- it will always be, as we said before, a very careful balance for us between productivity, innovation and pricing.\nJon Moeller: Yeah. Our retail partners are also competitors in most cases, with their own label offerings. And because the increases and costs are so significant, they need to be able, in most cases, obviously, entirely at their discretion, but they need to be generally able to raise pricing on their own brands. And when that's true, that becomes less of an issue, not a non-issue, but less of an issue for us. And I think the biggest change that's occurred over the last several years in our dialogue has been a more deliberate and overfocus on our part on market growth and on being -- and a commitment to be a disproportionate contributor to market growth. At the end of the day, a retail partner doesn't care what our share is. What they care about is what their sales are and are they growing or not. And we need to be a source of that growth. And when we do that dependably and reliably, as Andre said, it changes the nature of the conversation. And that becomes the focus of the conversation as opposed to other things. We have an opportunity in better serving our retail partners with supply as we've talked about several times, and we're working to address that. That's important in terms of continuing to serve them effectively. But that contribution to market growth sustainably and dependently changes world.\nAndre Schulten: All right. I think that concludes the call. Thank you for spending time with us today. John Chevalier and I will be available all day if you have any other questions, so please feel free to call. You know where to find us. Have a wonderful rest of the day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Hey, Robert, this is Jon. Just a couple of other pieces of perspective on this, and of course, it's a rapidly evolving situation, and this could change tomorrow. But if you look for data points to support Andre's comments on consumer resilience, you obviously see them within the internals of our income statement as you mentioned. Also, if you look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, they remain below a year ago in the US for the past three, six and 12 months. They remain below a year ago in Europe for the past three, six and 12 months. And if you look at market shares across channels, Andre mentioned earlier that we're -- we've worked to improve our distribution in channels where consumers with more of a budget challenge are inclined to shop. Our share growth in those channels, entirely consistent with his points, are some of our highest share growth across retail banners. So in the dollar channel, for example, significant share growth. Again, we'll have to monitor this very closely. Things can change tomorrow. But as we sit here today, it looks like the moves we've made to focus the portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and deliver on the performance aspect across the vectors of superiority and be very granular in our pricing executions is holding up. Yes. Market growth is something that doesn't happen to us. We need to positively impact it ourselves, which is exactly what Andre just said. And that's what we're trying to do through our strategy. I would also say, Kevin, that if you look at the last quarter, there are several negatives within the quarter from a top line standpoint, several challenges that we've been working against.

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We will keep prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. This was another strong quarter, strong top line growth across categories and regions, sequential earnings growth progress in the face of significant and still increasing cost headwinds. Starting with a few highlights on the March quarter. Organic sales grew 10%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth. Pricing added 5 points as additional price increases began to reach the market. Mix added 2 points to sales growth for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew more than 30%. Fabric Care was up low-teens. Baby Care and Feminine Care grew double digits. Oral Care and Grooming up high singles. Home Care and Family Care up mid-single digits. Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low singles. Focus markets grew 9%, and enterprise markets were up 12%. In focus markets, US organic sales were up 11% on 7% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, US organic sales up 18%. Focus markets in Europe were up 10% and Asia Pacific, up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down mid-single digits versus a comp period that was up 22%. Market conditions continued to soften in the March quarter due to COVID-driven lockdowns. In enterprise markets, Europe grew 18%; Latin America, up 16%; and Asia Middle East Africa grew 8%. Broad-based growth across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales high singles or better. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the US categories in which we compete grew nearly 9% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow, up 1 point versus same quarter last year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12-month period in the US and globally. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands, recognizing the superior performance and value. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.33, up 6% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 10%. Within the EPS results, we estimate Ukraine, Russia was a negative impact of about $0.01 per share. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points, and currency neutral core gross margin was down 380 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 490 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 130 basis point headwind, mainly from product form and pack size mix impact. Pricing and productivity savings of 260 basis points partially offset the gross margin headwinds. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 380 basis points due to strong top line leverage. Advertising investments remain strong as we continue to communicate the superiority and value of P&G offerings across price tiers. Core operating margin decreased 10 basis points. Currency neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Productivity improvements were 170 basis points helped to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 74% as receivables and inventories increased due to strong sales results. We returned $3.4 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners, many of whom rely on the steady, reliable income earned with their P&G investment. This is the [66th] (ph) consecutive annual dividend increase and 132nd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. So three quarters into the fiscal, organic sales up nearly 7% on broad-based growth across categories and geographies, solid global value share growth, sequentially improving EPS growth, strong cash productivity and an increased income commitment to owners of P&G shares. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down on our efforts to delight consumers. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation; a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. This drives value creation for our retail partners and build market share for P&G brands. Noticeable superiority is perhaps the most important in the inflationary environment we are potentially facing. A great example is the formula innovation we've launched on Tide and Ariel laundry detergents to enable superior cleaning performance in cold water washing. We're strengthening the communication of the cost benefits to consumers and the environmental benefits for the planet on the package and in our advertising. For consumers, the savings from switching from hot to cold washing can nearly offset the cost of Tide or Ariel liquid detergent in each load. The superior cold water performance is strong competitive advantage, enables immediate energy cost savings for our consumers and avoids the cost of rewashing, which may be necessary with less effective detergents. In addition, washing with cold water improves sustainability by reducing the energy required to heat water in the process and by improving garment lifespans. Superior innovation delivering multiple benefits and improved value for consumers, even while we price to offset a portion of the cost increases we are absorbing. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chain and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases. We closed a couple of price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investments to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We are committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of our strategies. Leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce costs and enable rapid and efficient decision-making, next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapted to a new reality. And our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicity, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and to develop the best talent. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority in reducing cost to enable investment and value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move forward. Moving on to guidance. We said each quarter that we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. We've seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us. Transportation and labor markets remain tight. Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and markets. Inflationary cost pressures are broad-based and continue to increase with little sign of near-term relief and have resulted in consumer price increases across CPG categories and beyond. The recent spike in virus cases in China and resulting lockdowns are affecting consumption and have caused temporary work stoppages in our operations and those of our suppliers. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to their impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution excellence have positioned us well to manage through these challenges over time. Based on the current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.5 million after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Since our last update, we've seen continued cost increases in nearly every type of material we use and in diesel and in natural gas. Freight costs have continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be a $400 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. Foreign exchange rate has also moved further against us, since our last guidance. We now expect FX to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We are offsetting a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. In the start of the fiscal year, we've taken price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the US. You may recall, it was one year ago, when we announced price increases in the Feminine Care and Baby Care categories. Over the last year, input costs have continued to increase substantially. And as a result, the Feminine Care business has announced an additional price increase in the US, which will be effective in mid-July. Also, as a result of these increased cost headwinds, we recently announced price increases on certain items in the US Home Care category that will be effective at the end of June and in the US Oral Care business that will be effective mid-July. As always, each category in each market is continually assessing the cost impacts they face and the potential need for pricing. If there are decisions to price, the degree and timing of those moves will be very specific to the category, the brand and sometimes to the individual SKU. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Also, just as we've done over the past year, we'll look to close a couple of price increases with new innovation that offers our consumers more value, continue to drive category growth and maintain our competitive superiority advantage. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to key guidance metrics. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 6% to 7% for the fiscal year, a two-point increase versus our prior guidance of 4% to 5%. Pricing was a sequentially stronger contributor to top line growth in the third quarter and will continue to be a driver again in the fourth quarter as we get the full effect of increases taken over the past few months. We are closely monitoring consumption trends for signs of changes. So far, elasticities have been in line or better than our expectations. Demand for our best-performing, premium-priced offerings remain strong as do our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're maintaining the core earnings per share growth range of 3% to 6%. But given cost challenges we're facing, we now expect to be at the low end of the range at 3%. Within this guidance, we expect an additional $0.04 per share of negative impact in the fourth quarter from higher costs and limited operations in Ukraine and Russia. The impact from commodities, freight and foreign exchange has increased significantly since the start of the fiscal year. Our initial guidance in July assumed $1.8 billion after tax or about $0.70 a share. This increased to $2.3 billion in our October outlook, $2.8 billion in January, now a $3.2 billion after-tax headwind to fiscal 2022 earnings. On an EPS basis, the headwinds are now approximately $1.26 a share or a 22% headwind to core EPS. So in the face of an incremental $0.56 per share of negative cost impact since the start of the year, we've held our going-in EPS range, and we've maintained strong investment superiority with new product innovation and fully funded advertising programs. Of note, the majority of the recent $400 million increase in cost and foreign exchange headwinds will impact us in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95% for the year. We continue to expect to pay $8 billion in dividends and now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions and store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, our business continues to exhibit strong momentum. And we believe P&G is well positioned to grow through and beyond the immediate issues we are facing. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and market volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Sure, morning, Lauren. Yeah, so as you said, in the data at this point, we continue to see favorable price elasticities relative to historic elasticities we've observed. Elasticities are better by about 20% to 30% versus what historical data would have indicated. That's good. But looking forward, we certainly have our eyes wide open and watch for any change in terms of consumer behavior. And as we say, we prepare on multiple fronts. I think the first level of protection here is the portfolio we've chosen to play in. We've moved out of discretionary categories into categories that are daily use, health- and hygiene-focused, where performance truly drive brand choice. That allows us to continue to invest in superiority, which we are doing consistently. Even though we see cost pressures, we continue to invest in superiority in every category and every proposition. That is probably the best protection. And consumers are rewarding us with continued trade-in and continuous trade up, which you see in the share numbers to date. The superiority also allows us to translate product superiority, for example, into value superiority more directly for the consumers. So that's the second intervention I would describe. So we are more proactively turning true product superiority into value claims that we put on tech, use in our advertising. One example is the Ariel cold -- Ariel and Tide cold water wash that I have mentioned in the prepared remarks. There are other innovations like the ADW, the automatic dishwasher myth buster, stating that even with eight dishes, it's more efficient to use the dishwasher than cleaning the dishes under running water, the latest easy squeeze innovation on Dawn that allows the consumer to use every last drop without any compromise on performance. So those are examples that we're turning into value plays to have consumers understand more easily the value that is coming by using P&G propositions. We have intentionally built price levels in every brand and across brands to ensure that we have offerings for consumers. If they feel they are budget constrained, they can trade within the P&G brand offerings. So on diapers, we have multiple offerings, starting with Pampers Pure at about $0.40 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20. These price ladders exist in all categories and offer the consumer a choice within the P&G portfolio. We are also, which is part of our pricing execution, protecting key price points, key value price points for each offering. So consumers can choose different cash outlays as they shop based on their available cash at the moment of shopping. The last element, we intentionally built distribution across all channels and invested in all channels. And that includes channels that consumers that are more budget constrained would migrate to like hard discounters in Europe, like the dollar channel in the U.S., for example. So building distribution across those channels to be able to serve the consumer where they want to shop is the last element I would call out. So, all of those leave us in a better position than we've ever been to deal with the potential consumer that is more budget constrained. To-date, we're not seeing that come through. Yes. Thanks. Morning, Bryan. You're right. Over the past three quarters, you see pricing and productivity continue to increase a bigger portion of the commodity, foreign exchange and T&W gross margin impact. In quarter one, this covered 37%. In quarter two, we covered, I believe, 43%, and now we're at 53%. So you see a bigger portion being covered over time\u2013 [via] (ph) those effects. We will continue to drive all three levers to recover the dollar impact of commodity cost increases, foreign exchange and T&W. Productivity will continue to play a significant role. We have a lot of runway left on productivity. And as the supply situation stabilizes here over time, we have more line time and more resources available to reinvest in cost of goods savings. And that will allow us to strengthen our productivity muscle here sequentially, hopefully, over the next few quarters. We will continue to drive innovation. We have prioritized innovation in our resource and line time allocation to ensure that we can continue to offer superior value to our consumers, which also enables us to take pricing and see these relatively benign elasticities at this point in time. So you continue to see us invest in innovation. With innovation, we will try to take pricing at a very granular level by market, by brand. A lot of the price increases that we have announced are yet to flow through. So you will see an incremental contribution to the top line and to gross margin recovery over the future. The other price increase is already announced, and we will have to carefully evaluate more opportunities to take pricing. It will take time to recover the full dollar impact. And as we said before, it's more important to us to support the business model, support innovation, support superiority, execute pricing in the right way and recover gross margin and cost impact over time versus rushing to do this faster. So, you should expect sequential progress. I won't give you a specific timeline. We will continue to use all three, productivity, innovation and pricing. Yes. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. Look, China, the lockdowns had two impacts in China for us. One, on the supply side, we have two plants in the Shanghai area and the contract manufacturer. Those obviously were shut down for now an extended period of time. So we had to activate our business continuity plans to offset as much of that production impact as we could. And we're certainly seeing a significant impact in terms of consumer demand. About 25%, I think, was the Wall Street estimates of consumers are somehow impacted by lockdown. That is impacting our consumers' ability to reach stores, grocery stores, department stores. Even online shopping is significantly constrained due to the inability to deliver. So we certainly see a significant impact from lockdowns. Latest read of market size in our categories over the past three months through March was flat in terms of value in China. With the continued lockdown and the difficulties in the market, we would expect April to be flat to negative. In terms of category detail, Beauty is significantly exposed to China. As you know, a bigger part of Beauty is -- of the Beauty business is in China. SK-II continues to be under pressure due to the market effect and channel effects in China. So that dynamic has not changed. The longer-term story on China based on historical results, which has been extremely strong over the past three, four years, as you know, we've grown high singles, low doubles in China. We believe the market continues to be a very attractive market for us. We expect categories to return to mid-single, high singles growth. We have a very strong organization, a very strong supply chain, a very strong R&D organization in China. So we remain confident, and we will continue to invest to capture the growth in the future. Okay. Thanks, Robert. So in terms of pricing run rate for the quarter, on average, we have a five point contribution to top line. As we said, pricing will continue to increase as more of the price increases flow through. So I would say exiting the quarter, I would see about a 6% run rate to top line from pricing contribution. So you will see more of the pricing that has been announced, and that will flow through in April for the flow through in quarter four. Pricing elasticities remain favorable. And within the portfolio that we offer to consumers, we broadly see a trade up into higher price propositions that offer better value and better product performance. So \u2013 and that explains the mix effect that you see in gross margin, where we see higher unit sales items being chosen with higher penny profit, but slightly lower gross margin. So consumers are trading into single unit dose detergents instead of liquid detergent. Consumers are trading into body lotions instead of Baby Dry in diapers. So we see consumers trading up even within our portfolio into higher-performing product propositions. The relevancy of \u2013 or the relevance of product performance in our categories, we believe, is the reason why consumers are not trading down. We've had an extensive period of trial during the early COVID phases, where consumers have traded into P&G. They've experienced the superior performance of our propositions. They've seen the relative value that we provide. Even though the cash outlay might be higher, they see the higher efficacy of the product and the benefit that they gain from it. And we've seen repeat rates reaffirming that. We believe that a good portion of the resiliency of our demand is driven by the superiority of the product and packaging, clear communication of the benefits basis, clear communication of the value, good retail execution and carefully crafted price increases that allow consumers to choose the cash outlay they feel ready to afford and to choose the brand and brand proposition that they are looking for. So I'll leave it at that. Morning, Kevin. Thank you. So category growth rates are holding up well. Fiscal year-to-date, global category growth in the categories we compete in is 5%. We expect that to continue at around 5%. Category growth in focus markets is 5%. Category growth in enterprise markets is 7%. So it's a strong 5% on a global level. It's fairly consistent. Enterprise markets have been growing past three, six and 12 at 7%. Focus markets have gone between 4% and 5% over the past three, six and 12 months. So if anything, in the most recent reading, we've seen strengthening of category growth. We're also pleased with the fact that we see P&G leading and disproportionately contributing to category growth in most of the markets we're competing in, via innovation and via leading innovation and thereby driving category growth and participating in that category growth via share growth. So overall, we feel good about the level of category growth. We're seeing slight acceleration across the periods P&G contributing via our strategy of driving market growth, via superiority investment and innovation. And that certainly is benefiting our growth and is in line with our growth model we want to drive because the only way to sustainably grow at these level's by driving market growth and then participating in that growth via shared growth. All right. Morning, Olivia. Supply constraints, maybe to start at the global level, supply constraints are only present in every potential bucket that you can think through. Being able to source raw and materials is still difficult in sufficient quantities. Getting raw and packed materials to the places we need to get them to continues to be costly and highly volatile. Labor availability is certainly a stretch, not for P&G directly, but more for our supplier base. And then getting finished product out to our retailers by being able to actually ship with truck availability in the U.S., for example, is difficult. So it's across all aspects of the supply chain. We are making progress. Our on-shelf availability continues to be stable at around 93%, 94% even as we grow at these levels that we are happy to report we're growing at in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date. We have more and more categories coming off managed supply in the US over the next two months. So we are carefully working with our retail partners to ensure that we do this in the right way to ensure best service and best on-shelf availability with our retail partners. And we're making progress. Heavy -- the most investment in terms of capacity will be in our North America and European markets to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to keep up with increased demand we've seen. Those investments will take hold over the next two years. But we expect to be in a better situation over the next, call it, three to six months, specifically in the US moving out of managed supply. There is no -- to your second part of the question on pricing, I -- there is no formula-based approach to pricing in any of these categories. So we're carefully watching number one, consumer behavior and the strength of our superiority relative to the market. We are looking at the cost pressures and cost headwinds that we are seeing. And you will have noticed that in our paper categories in Fem Care, in Baby Care, in Family Care and in our Fabric & Home Care categories, that's where we see the biggest impact from commodity cost increases, transportation warehouse, but also foreign exchange impacts. So the impacts are bigger. There is superiority, and then it becomes a matter of, do we have the right innovation available, or do we feel that it is right at this point in time to recover via pricing versus leveraging productivity and the balance between those three elements as we've talked before. So I wouldn't say there's any formulaic approach. But certainly, Fabric & Home Care and the paper categories are most exposed to the cost pressures. So, the combination of all three elements needs to play out more aggressively in those categories than maybe in some others. Jon, anything you want to add? Okay. In terms of priority, our priority remains a reasonable recovery time on the dollar impact of commodities, foreign exchange and T&W headwinds across all categories. We will do this in a way that provides value to the consumer, provides a superior proposition to the consumer by combining it with innovation. There is no time line for us that forces us to recover gross margin over a certain period of time. We want to return to margin expansion, and we will. Our balanced growth model requires us to drive top line, bottom line but also reasonable margin expansion. So there is continued commitment to return to that point, but we will do it in a way that provides the right value to the consumer in every brand in every market at any given point in time, so we can serve consumers in the best way possible and maintain business momentum. To your second question on foreign exchange rate pricing, across markets, foreign exchange rate pricing is a reality we're dealing with every day, we've been dealing with for years. Nothing different to report in terms of elasticities, it's being executed in some markets, more pronounced. You've seen us taking significant price increases, for example, in Turkey, significant price increases in Argentina. So those are being executed. The organizations know very well how to do those, and they are baked in our forecast and guidance. Yeah. Good morning, Nik, look, we're not seeing it. We've seen consumers trade into P&G brands and trade up within the P&G brand portfolio throughout the pandemic. Every quarter this fiscal year, we've seen consumers continue to trade up within the P&G brand portfolio into higher premium propositions across most categories. That's the mix effect you've seen on the gross margin and the positive mix effect on sales. So we continue to see consumers stay within the P&G portfolio and many consumers actually trading up within the P&G portfolio as they see the benefit of those higher premium propositions. As we've said before, we don't take that for granted. We don't assume that what we're seeing to date is necessarily an indication of what will happen in the future. We are very well aware that consumers might end up looking at budget constraints. Where we see, for example, private label losses reducing, we continue to see P&G growth. So even private label coming back so far is not impacting P&G's ability to grow within those markets or within those market category combinations. Our best defense to serve the consumer in a more budget constrained environment, other point we've talked through from the portfolio focus that we're operating to superiority to value plays, cash outlay choices, price ladder choices, distribution across our channels. So I come back to those elements that we control. That will serve us well, I believe, even for consumers that are more budget constrained and looking for choices. All right. Thanks, Chris. PHC had a fabulous quarter, as we point out. Part of that certainly is the stronger cold, cough and flu season. It's 57% stronger in our estimation than last year's season, which was abnormally low driven by the mask mandates and everything else going on, a slightly stronger season than average by about 4%. But importantly, North America Vicks, for example, was able to outpace that season growth, plus 123% growth versus the season, which drove about 1.9 share points over the period. So within respiratory, season recovery is certainly a big point, but mix growing ahead of the season recovery and building share. The growth is also broader than just respiratory. Digestive organic sales are up mid-teens, and fleet is up nearly 30%. So the breadth of the portfolio is performing even beyond just the season recovery. So we continue to be very pleased with the results of the PHC portfolio and certainly see significant future runway there. On quarter four, sales guidance, the only thing I would say is as we mentioned before, we do not assume the favorable price elasticities to hold. In our forecasting, we assume price elasticity is to return to normal levels that we've seen historically. That's the only thing I'll let you know. And the rest, I think, is fairly clear. General comment over time, Kaumil. We're not forecasting gross margin or gross margin guidance here, too many moving pieces. But over time, we remain committed to building gross margin as part of the balanced growth model. Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're very confident in the Beauty portfolio. If you look at the performance of this portfolio over the past five years, it's been just outstanding, right? The core portfolio has grown sales more than $3 billion over the past five years, profits more than $1 billion, significant shareholder value creation and 26 quarters of uninterrupted growth. So the core portfolio has been performing extremely well. And as you say, there are a number of headwinds that we see as temporary. China and the dynamics in China certainly being one of those significant dynamics, which is impacting the broader Hair Care and Skin Care portfolio, but also the broader impact on SK-II as it comes to the travel retail shutdown during the COVID period and the impact of China on the SK-II consumption with department stores being closed down and even some of the online business being hampered. So there are a number of temporary effects that we see. We -- you have seen us announce a few portfolio additions, acquisitions over the past months that are focused on the premium and super premium segments in the category. We believe that's a growth opportunity beyond the core portfolio in specialty channels. So we've proven that strategy with previous acquisitions like First Aid Beauty. And so we want to build out the portfolio in the premium and super premium segment in addition to restrengthening the core. So there's certainly work to do to address the opportunities in China on the core business, rebuild strength and momentum on SK-II and further help our business to serve premium and super premium consumers and specialty channels in the US and outside the US. But we're very confident in the core focused portfolio and some targeted additions via acquisition that we tucked in, which set us up for future growth in the Beauty category. Yes, I can start Peter, and then maybe Jon wants to add a few points here. But overall consumption is holding up. As I mentioned, market growth, 5% of focus markets, 7% in enterprise markets. That's certainly an indication that overall consumption in all categories is holding up well. There are some natural -- not natural, but logical switches. So when we think about, for example, our Grooming business, the Appliances business has experienced significant growth during the pandemic as more and more jobs that were done in salons and barbershops moved in-house. So folks -- people bought these appliances, experienced the fact that they can do the job themselves, and they continue to do so. But once that need is satisfied, appliances sees a decline versus that peak in terms of incremental job growth and incremental overall growth. At the same time, there's a natural hedge within the Grooming portfolio. So blades and razors were under pressure, as more people work from home and stayed at home. With reopening, that part of the category resumed growth. So there's a hedge component within Grooming, for example. Within anything that is health and hygiene related, I think consumers continue to put more emphasis on jobs to be done. They spend more time at home. So we continue to see our categories to benefit from both effects. Paper towel consumption continues to be increased by more than 10%. We'll see where bath tissue ends up once supply is unconstrained, but more time at home certainly would speak to more in-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. The only part where we saw a little bit of a decline was anything that has to do with household -- surface disinfection, surface cleaning. That's a relatively smaller part of our portfolio. But as consumers get more used to the right balance there, we saw a little bit of a decline. But overall, all categories still benefiting from more time at home and higher focus on health and hygiene and certainly Beauty and Personal Care-related categories benefiting from reopening. Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. So Baby Care share is improving significantly in Europe and in North America driven by major innovation that was launched in the market, both in Europe and in North America. We will continue to build on that share momentum. We will continue to drive superiority via incremental innovation, investment in brand communication, go-to-market execution. We've also been able to enter some new parts and grow some new segments within the Baby Care category. When you think about launches, for example, in North America, that's a category that has been relatively quiet, it serves children between 5 and 12 with all the night bed-wetting issues. And reentering that category with a creative and relevant proposition allowed us to grow the category mid-teens and at the same time, build an 8% -- 8% to 9% share position within the category. We continue to build share in pants. Pants is a trade-up category in Europe and an opportunity in North America that allows us to grow our position as well. So broad innovation in terms of true product innovation, but also new jobs to be done and communication. Fem Care, we are seeing big success in both adult incontinence, but also in the most premium propositions in Fem Care. The biggest growth, for example, in Fem Care pads in North America is driven by Infinity, our most premium proposition, which is a unique proposition from P&G form based pad, delivering superior comfort and absorbency. Again, same formula, significant \u2013 significantly innovating in relevant ways for the consumer, investment in communication, retail execution allows us to drive overall market growth and share growth. On cold and flu, I don't have much more to add, Andrea, versus what we said before. We are growing ahead of the segment in terms of respiratory with strong innovation in Vicks. And we are growing the balance of the portfolio in terms of absolute sales growth and share growth, be it sleep or digestive. So overall, we feel there's significant runway left on our PHC portfolio, and it's playing out in the market. I'll start, and I'm sure Jon has a few points to add here. But generally, discussions with retailers work better if your business comes from a position of strength. Consumers are looking for your propositions. Velocity at shelf is strong. You have innovation programs that are credible and tangible and meaningful for consumers. You have in-store programs that are meaningful for retailers and consumers. You have an ability to communicate and support the advertising, both in digital as well as in mass advertising. And all of those things hold true as we entered this commodity inflation cycle. P&G came from a relatively strong position in terms of superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. Products on shelf, we're doing well. And that sets up a good discussion with retailers about future growth potential, the need for pricing, which is very clear, given the inflation cycle and the reality that it's broad-based within multiple industries. No guarantee that, that will continue. It will also -- it will always be, as we said before, a very careful balance for us between productivity, innovation and pricing. All right. I think that concludes the call. Thank you for spending time with us today. John Chevalier and I will be available all day if you have any other questions, so please feel free to call. You know where to find us. Have a wonderful rest of the day."

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Q2 was a strong quarter, very strong top line growth, sequential earnings progress in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong cash productivity. Our progress enables us to confirm fiscal year EPS guidance while increasing our estimates for top line growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners. Organic sales grew more than 6%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth, pricing added 3 points as September/October price increases flow through, and as year-on-year promotion comparisons normalize, mix was neutral for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew our health organic sales in the quarter, Personal Health Care grew 20%, Fabric Care and Feminine Care were up double digits, Baby Care up high singles, Grooming grew mid singles. Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low single-digit. Family Care organic sales were in line with prior year. Focus Markets grew 6% and Enterprise Markets were up 7% In Focus Markets, U.S. organic sales were up 9% despite 12% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 21%. Europe Focus Markets were up 5%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year against the strong 12% bass period comp and due to slower market growth in the quarter. In addition, we took proactive steps in the quarter to encourage our network of distributors to reduce inventory levels to reflect short-term consumer demand softness in the market. Latin America led the growth in Enterprise Markets up 15%. Global aggregate market share increased 60 basis points, 38 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn share growth for P&G. All general market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew nearly 3.5% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow up nearly 1.5 points versus same quarter last year now at 34%. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12 month periods in the U.S. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands and superior performance they provide even as inflation is impacting household budgets. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.66, up 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 2%. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 410 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impact combined were a 460 basis points hit to gross margins. Mix was 140 basis points headwind, mainly from product mix impacts. Productivity savings and pricing each provided partial offsets to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&,A advertising spending increased versus prior year as we continue to invest to communicate the superiority of our brands. However, overall marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points, driven by sales leverage and savings in non-working marketing costs. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 240 basis points. Productivity improvements were 150 basis point help to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 106%. We returned nearly $7 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, while input cost and supply chains remained challenging, we delivered good results for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, keeping us on track to deliver our going-in earnings estimates and to raise estimates for sales, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, which I'll come back to later. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stays focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis, and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that has been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth and our categories. This drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. The superiority model works in each of our categories. Take the three category growth drivers this quarter: Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, and Feminine Care, very different categories, different competitors, different geographic footprints, and different materials and manufacturing processes, each delivering superiority and each growing organic sales double digits. In each of these categories P&G is driving a disproportionate share of overall category value growth growing the pie for all participants. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases, we closed couple price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within the P&L and balance sheet to support balance top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes through the mind set of constructive disruption, of willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields are more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices of portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn growth shares, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis have served us well during these volatile times, and we're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving on to guidance, we said last quarter that we would undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. The Omicron variant has certainly proven this to be correct. As we saw in the first half of the fiscal year, growth, results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects. Along with these realities of current year cost pressures, foreign exchange, volatility and continued effects of the global pandemic on supply chains and consumer behavior. Transportation and labor markets remain tight, availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad based with little sign of near term relief. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. The recent spike in virus cases and resulting lockdowns, increase the risk of additional work stoppages in our operations or in those of our suppliers. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Since our last update, we've seen continued increases in diesel and chemicals with little offset and other materials. Trade costs have continued to increase, we now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $300 million after tax headwind for fiscal 2022. Foreign exchange rates have also moved against us since our last guidance, we now expect FX to be a $200 million after tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We will offset a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. We've now announced price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the U.S. increases in Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, Hair Care, Grooming, Oral Care, Skincare, are now effective in market. We also increased prices on mid-tier liquid detergents, and powder detergents over the last few months. In mid-December, we announced to retailers that effective February 28 we are increasing pricing on the balance of our Fabric Care portfolio. This includes Tide, Gain, Downy Bounce at unstoppables, and includes all forms liquid and unit-dose detergents, scent beads, liquid fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Just yesterday, we announced to retailers that we are increasing pricing on certain personal healthcare brands in the U.S. effective mid-April. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one size fits all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity freight and foreign exchange impacts. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to the key metric guidance. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year, up from our initial range of 2% to 4%. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reaches store shelves we\u2019ll be closely monitoring consumption trends. So far, we haven't seen noticeable changes in consumer behavior. Demand for our best performing premium priced offerings remains very strong as to our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're confirming our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of 3% to 6%. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.8 billion after tax headwind for fiscal 2022 earnings, or roughly $1.10 per share, a 20 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands, as pricing goes into effect and as we annualize the initial spike in input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity to 95%. And we are raising our guidance for cash return to share owners. We continue to expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends. And we now plan to repurchase $9 billion to $10 billion of common stock combined a plan to return $17 billion to $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates commodity price and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis that we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage to the near term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balance top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning. So the top line side clearly strong results across the board, but Beauty top line growth was below consensus in the quarter. So just any thoughts on the Beauty top line performance? And specifically maybe you can talk about China Beauty from a category and market share perspective in the December quarter? And any go-forward thoughts on China Beauty or China in general given the flattish year-over-year trends in the quarter? And then on the rest of the business with the strong market share results, can you just talk about your level of confidence going forward and sustaining those share gains and how supply chain and consumer and retailer acceptance of price increases may impact the forward outlook from a market share perspective? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: All right. Good morning, Dara, that's a lot. So let me start with maybe two and focus on Beauty and China within that. Look, if you look at our Beauty business over a longer period of time, the business has actually delivered about $3 billion in incremental sales over the past five years, more than $1 billion of incremental profit, significant contribution to shareholder return, 25 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, including this quarter. When we look at this quarter on a two-year stack, on Beauty, it\u2019s 7% for quarter two, quarter one was a 9% stack. The Health Care growing 2%, Skin and Personal Care growing 3%. So we feel good about the overall performance of the Beauty business and the strength of the core portfolio. There is significant runway, I'll comment on China in a minute. We certainly saw a slowdown in some of the Beauty portfolio, namely SK-II which we've mentioned before, store closures of department stores, lower traffic there, and also slower key consumption periods in some of the China events. And honestly, our unwillingness to go into very deep discount levels on the brand have contributed to a slower growth in quarter two. Overall, the portfolio is strong. We believe has very strong growth potential in the future. We are also excited about the acquisitions we've announced. Tula, Farmacy Beauty and Ouai, all focused on the premium end of the trade in the U.S. premium consumers, which is a giving up opportunity for additional top line growth and value creation in the U.S. and also globally. On China, I\u2019ll start with a similar comment. China, over the past four or five years, has delivered high singles or low-teens sales growth. We have a stable or very strong brands. We continue to believe that consumption after a weaker period in quarter one, as you have seen, and quarter two in the market. Consumption in our categories were returned to mid singles and we feel well-positioned to benefit from that growth with a strong organization, strong supply chain and strong R&D capability on the ground. The other point to note even with China being flat in the quarter, from a global perspective, we were able to grow more than 6%. And part of that is the strength of the geographic portfolio that we need to focus on because in some markets, we might have to invest. China certainly is at this point in time, as you point out weaker in an overall - from an overall consumption standpoint. So I'll stop there. I'm sure we'll get back to your other questions and some of the other comments, Dara.\nOperator: All right. The next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious to talk a little bit about productivity. The contribution this quarter was only I think 80 basis points. It was cited in the release. And just I would guess that means a big ramp up in the second half. So I was curious, why relative to timing, if it has to do with COVID and absenteeism if it's related to how you calculate this based on raw material access, and so on. But just anything you can share on productivity plans, and timing would be helpful? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Good morning, Lauren. Productivity, the number of 80 basis points in the quarter, we expect about $800 million BT productivity contribution from cost of goods for the year. And it's a little bit lighter than what we would have done in previous years. But most importantly, we remain fully committed to productivity as a core driver of margin expansion. In the short-term, there are a couple of effects that I want to spend a minute on. Number one, when you think about cost savings projects, they require line time, that line time is competing with the need to ship cases in a very constrained supply chain. When we think about innovation, we talk frequently about our desire to close copper price increases with innovation. Innovation also needs lifetime. So cost savings projects on the line also compete with innovation, and they compete with our desire and need to ship the business. Therefore, in a constrained environment, as you point out, our businesses make the decision to focus on innovation, focus on shipping the business, which is better for retailers, better for consumers, better for us in terms of value creation, but it has an impact on cost savings. The good news is these cost savings are available to us in the future, they don't go anywhere. But you see a little bit slower ramp up in that context. Second element I would mention is the global pressure on supply chain. And the flexibility that we talked about that our supply people have generated, doesn't come for free. So when we need to shift to alternate materials, when we need to shift to alternate suppliers, or sources of materials geographically, that comes as a premium, which goes against productivity, again, the right choice, because shipping the cases is financially more viable than creating the cost saving. But it has an impact. And then the last point I'll make is, negotiating commercial savings when everyone is trying to get the materials in sufficient quantity is also a bit more difficult. So all of that to say short-term, pressure, longer-term, fully committed to productivity being a core driver of margin expansion and balance growth model. and you see progress quarter by quarter.\nJon Moeller: I would just add, Lauren, that, Omicron hasn't helped. It further pressurizes the dynamics that Andre spoke about, and it just reduces the resources we have available at any point in time to work on these things. When - as people become infected and need to quarantine, as they need to take care of family members, as children's schools are closed, all of those things have a real impact, which to Andre\u2019s point, should lighten as hopefully, everyone on the call, please cross your fingers as we go forward.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks, and good morning. Maybe building on that a little bit. So as we think about the back half and the leverage that you have at your disposal to offset the $2.8 billion in commodity freight currency headwinds that you now face. I guess, can you talk a little bit \u2013 I guess, can you elaborate a little bit more on the initiatives that you've put in place specifically over the last three months to help with that in as we get to calendar 2022. And I guess I'm specifically curious when we think about the second half P&L as to how you anticipate the drivers of organic growth shaking out price versus volume, number one. And then number two, whether we should expect marketing, inclusive of non-working media productivity to remain a continuous source of positive leverage as the year continues?\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Steve. Alright, so from a growth margin perspective, a couple of things will come to play here. If you will assume that the existing commodity foreign exchange rate and transportation warehousing pressures remain at this level, which is our basis for planning, we will benefit from more pricing flowing through the P&L. Most of all price increases that you've seen in our prepared remarks have gone, or some have gone into effect in September and October, but the majority of the price increases are still coming into effect over December, quarter one, quarter three and quarter four. So the contribution of pricing both to gross margin recover as well as to the price mix line within the top line is going to increase sequentially, as we go through the fiscal year. We also will see in the base period, the commodity pressures are coming into the base gross margin, starting with the third quarter, and then really flowing in the fourth quarter based comparison. So that's going to help the gross margin comparison as well. And lastly, the continuation of hopefully, more stability in the labor force more stability around COVID as we exit this winter, will allow us to increase contribution from productivity as I've talked before, which will also help gross margin recovery in the second half. On the pricing contribution versus volume contribution, I expect price to become a bigger part as I said logically because of the timing of the price increases that we have announced. And in terms of ability to sustain the pricing, we have seen for the price increases where we have sufficient read period at this point in time, we have seen a more benign reaction of the consumer, the consumer is healthy generally, and is preferring our brands, we're starting with strong security and price elasticity has generally been lower than what would we what would what we would have seen historically, which also speaks to the fact that we hopefully will continue to see volume growth in combination with a stronger price growth in the background.\nJon Moeller: I just want to underscore something that Andre said. Remember, that the pricing that we've announced, even the pricing has taken effect at shelf. We didn't have a full quarter benefit from the quarter we just completed. So that's simple roll forward is a help. And the majority of the pricing that we've announced has not yet taken place.\nOperator: All right. Next question will be from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thank you for stopping in. I wanted to drill a little bit deeper on the cost and price outlook. So a couple of things. First, in response to that last question, I think I got the sense, clearly Telegraph that says the pricing will continue to build back half, it sounds like you're looking for at least 4%, if not more price contribution, or at least about one and a half billion or so net sales contribution. If we look at your cost and of both commodities and freight in the 2.6, I think from your margin bridge it implies that you've already absorbed around 1.7 billion in the front half. So in other words, you're expecting a billion or less in the back half. And we should therefore expect a price cost surplus to emerge. I want to make sure I had all my math right on that at least directionally. And then the second part, you've clearly had to revise your commodity and freight outlook up the last few quarters. Remind us again, what the current commodity outlook is predicated on, so that we can get a proper sense of what the upside downside risk are to that? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Yes. Good morning, Jason. On the commodity and transportation warehousing timing, yes, I mean, I assume your math is right. I won't check it here. But we can certainly follow up as needed. We assume in our forecast in our guidance, spot prices for both the commodity basket and for transportation and warehousing. We've seen increases still in this last cycle as reflected in the increase in commodities and transportation and warehousing. But we're also seeing a slower rate of increase. So hopefully, meaning that we reach the peak here soon. But we are building our financial forecast and all financial planning on that level. So we don't assume any easing in terms of transportation and warehousing or commodity cost impact or foreign exchange for that matter.\nOperator: Next question will come from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of how you assess your revenue management skills at this point. Clearly, the results would suggest they're pretty positive. But, we'd love I'd love to understand some maybe some of the changes that you've done over the last few years to improve your ability to manage an inflationary environment. If in fact, you know that is what we're headed into for a long period. Your ability to work with different elasticities manage, trade, spend, etcetera both in the U.S. and overseas and how it may be better than it was in the past? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Very good morning, Robert. If I step back I think we're better positioned for dealing with an inflationary environment or revenue management in that sense than we've ever been before. Starting with a portfolio that is focused on daily use categories health, hygiene and cleaning that are essential to the consumer versus discretionary categories, which in these environments are the first ones to lose focus from the consumer. Secondly, starting with a portfolio that is 75% superior by our assessment and reflected probably in the market share results and trends that we're seeing. We also over time have built much stronger price letters. So we have offerings for the consumer at different price points, and different cash outlays. When you think about diapers, you can get a Luvs diaper for $0.15 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.30, or Pure diaper at $0.38. And that's generally true across all categories across all brands. So that means the consumer has a choice within our portfolio. So in that sense, I think we are set up well, from a starting point to deal with inflation and related pricing. From an execution standpoint, I think we also benefit from a couple of things. Number one, the organizational redesign in focus markets and enterprise markets enables much faster and much clearer decision making, which is critical in these processes, and also much more diligence in terms of where to take pricing, country brand SKU level. And the other element here is that from an execution standpoint, we certainly have seen that innovation can play a significant role. And the strength of our innovation pipeline, and our ability to combine pricing with innovation is certainly helping us in this environment. That's what I make. And then Jon will probably have comments here as well. We've been operating in high inflation environments around the world for many years. Think about Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, those are high inflation markets and environments. So we know how to deal with that. Obviously, we hope we don't get to that place, but generally well positioned for the reasons I tried to outline here.\nJon Moeller: And just a reminder of the obvious, we're dealing with commodity costs increases that affect every competitor, both multinational and local, which changes the dynamic pretty considerably versus for example, pricing for foreign exchange, which has a differential impact across the competitive set. So it's not an easy job, but it's an easier job than we've managed, as Andre says successfully manage geographies in the recent past.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks, morning, everyone. I wanted to pivot and ask about M&A on a couple of different fronts, please just number one, the openness to larger scale M&A at this point. I think there was clearly a period in recent years post the portfolio rationalization where the company was sensibly very focused on turning around the portfolio larger scale, M&A wasn't really on the table. So is the organization in a better place? Is the board open to larger scale deals at this point? And if so maybe you could put some guardrails around that. And then relatedly Andre, you touched on some of the smaller tuck-in deals in prestige beauty, which have been picked up here, maybe just spend a moment there define the approach in prestige beauty given past missteps and the decision to exit some of the larger brands that were once in the portfolio there, I think that'd be helpful. Thank you for that.\nJon Moeller: Hey Kevin, this is Jon. A couple points on large M&A. The first very, very important point is we like our current portfolio. We have confidence that we can create value with that portfolio. And, frankly, all parts of it are working. Andre mentioned that, we're growing market share in nine out of 10 of those categories. And importantly, that market share growth is not taking business. It's creating business in large part affecting the overall growth of the market. So we're in a very healthy situation with a very healthy portfolio that's underpinned with a clear set of priorities and a very effective tightly integrated set of strategies. And we're adding, we're strengthening our strategic execution by a focus on four areas. One is supply. The second is digital competence across the value chain. The third is employee value. And the fourth is sustainability. We like that hand overall. Second point, our algorithm growing slightly ahead of the market with EPS up mid-to-high singles, assumes 100% organic growth. So again, we don't need large M&A to deliver against that. And we certainly haven't utilized large M&A in the last four or five year period when we've been delivering very regularly on that expectation. A couple other points, and then I'll get to beauty. And then Andre may have some comments on beauty as well. The -- we have said many times that there that we intend to win in these 10 categories that we've selected. And that acquisition would be a part of the way that we may choose to fill out categories in order to win. And we've talked about two categories in particular, that would be particularly focus areas. One is skincare, and the other is personal health care. So all of that remains as true. The last point I would make, which is I realized not very helpful to the audience at hand but as a matter of policy, we don't comment further than what I just have on acquisition or divestiture. On beauty, I want to clarify what I think has been a little bit of a misunderstanding. When we made the portfolio decisions as to what we were going to move out on beauty and what we were going to stay in. We did not make price tier decisions. We did not exit premium beauty, we made category decisions. And we exited several categories that were more discretionary, that were not daily use, and where performance had a lower role in driving brand choice. So for example, we maintained our most premium beauty offering SK-II. So this notion that we're, we got out of a price tier and now we're getting back in is not the way to think about it. We got out of categories. And we're strengthening those categories. And these the brands that we have purchased, as Andre said earlier play in the premium portion of the beauty categories, which are the fastest growing from a market standpoint to date, and obviously give us ample opportunity to create value given their margin structure. Andre, anything to add.\nAndre Schulten: Nothing to add.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning. This is actually [Indiscernible] for Andre here. So just in terms of service levels, can you please comment on your ability to fulfill just given the impacts of employee absenteeism and as improved from the peak amount of con worldwide? Thank you for that.\nJon Moeller: Morning. Our ability to supply is relatively stable, is stable actually. If you look at our on-shelf availability, for example in the U.S. Last quarter, we reported that was around 94%, we're still running at about 94% which is not where we want to be which will be more than 98%, 99% range. But good relative to peer group and good given again the overall challenges the industry is seeing, the retail environment seeing. So and that is true around the world. Our supply chain people who deserve all the credit here continue to do an absolutely amazing job making sure that our retail partners have the products available that our consumers want to buy. And there are no major outages given the flexibility we've created within the supply chain. Even in China as we saw regional lockdowns, we were able to shift production into alternative sites and thereby maintain supply. So continued great work while supply organization relatively stable situation, we'll continue to monitor closely because this is not over. So great success now with no guarantee for the future, but we certainly feel well positioned.\nOperator: Alright, next question will be from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. So one quick follow up on SK-II. Are you seeing that slowdown as temporary normalization in demand? Or do you think the brand is reaching some ceiling on growth, and hence, you've made these additional moves? And then, a broader question just on pricing and baby, price mixing the category has really accelerated, doesn't seem like it was that long ago, that the category was seeing higher promotional activity to drive volumes, can you just expand on the step change there. The drivers of the move on pricing and premiumization why it's the right move. And then, maybe any broader thoughts on, there's been some discussion around, a little bit of a mini baby boom. And I wonder if you have any thoughts there? Thanks so much.\nAndre Schulten: Alright, good morning. On SK-II, certainly no ceiling for the brand in terms of growth. The brand continues to carry enormous equity with existing users, enormous appeal to new users, specifically in the, in the Asia space. So we continue to be very encouraged by both the current strength of the brand, but also by the future pipeline and the initiatives that are to come. But the brand is operating in channels that are most impacted by the pandemic, that has an impact on our business, it has an impact on total consumption. And lastly, I mentioned this in the earlier question. We don't believe that heavy discounting is the right strategy in the short term to overcome some of these challenges. So we're focusing on building the equity building product efficacy, and running our business model to return to stronger growth here in the future. On the Baby category, your right price mix when you look at the U.S. but also globally is increasing, which is encouraging for two reasons encouraging number one; Baby Care is one of the hardest hit categories from a commodity impact. So it's good to see that the pricing that was taken is flowing through to the P&L to help with productivity, offset some of that commodity pressure. And we see the pricing in Baby flowing through really globally. So that's a core driver, and every player in the industry, as Jon mentioned before, has to find a way to offset these cost pressures that are very significant in this category. More encouraging to me is in our portfolio, the desire of the consumer to move up to higher premium offerings because they truly provide better value for the consumer. When you think about the U.S., for example, most of the growth, if not the absolute majority of the growth comes from tier one, our smallest proposition comes from Cruisers 360, which is a very unique proposition in the pants form for active babies, comes from Pampers Pure, and comes from Ninjamas, which is a bedwetting product, which we re-entered the category created significant growth in the category and build a 9% share position. So the portfolio strategy we're executing the innovation, we're bringing is rewarded by the consumer with trade up and that is a significant contributor to price mix. And hopefully and I think sustainable given the true benefits where we're seeing the consumer appreciate.\nJon Moeller: Just a couple of additional points on SK-II to hopefully make it clear and bring it to life what's actually happening here. If you dramatically simplify the SK-II business, you would simplify it historically into two primary channels. One is travel retail and the other is department store. And in both of those channels, it was it's typically been a council product, meaning there's some but there's a knowledgeable person in the store to help you understand the benefits of the product and which elements are right for you. With COVID, travel retail largely closed, in many parts of Asia and ability of counsellors to go to work for the multitude of reasons we're all familiar with, including some regulatory prohibitions. If you look at Japan, you have that dynamic plus you have what was a major source of business, which was Chinese travelers going to Japan to department stores, to buy a product to bring back to their friends and family. That's not happening. So when you ask, why is SK-II, currently soft? Those are the reasons. And as Andre indicated, it has nothing to do with the equity or strength of the brand. We've converted. And I really applaud the team for doing this, a fair amount of that purchase, from those channels to more local channels that support longer -- consumption. But still, the impact of this has been significant.\nOperator: Alright, next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, I wanted to just go back and talk about the M&A strategy for a minute just with regard to you know, not just the smaller brands that you've just recently announced acquiring, but maybe looking back, and can you give us kind of a little bit of an update on some of the smaller brands you've bought historically, whether it's First Aid Beauty, whether it's Native, or this is L, just to sort of tell us, how have they done? Has it been worth the effort, how fully integrated are they? Because, again, back to the earlier discussion about M&A? I think the question I would have is, these are small companies that obviously are growing rapidly now, but is it worth the hassle? Is it worth the effort? Is it worth the money to bring them into the P&G fold? Can they really ever move the needle? So just sort of, updating us on maybe your track record with regard to the prior small acquisitions you've made? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, very good. So when we have these discussion on is their value in integrating the small tuck-in acquisitions, we're obviously asking the exact same question. And the track record within beauty is actually very good. When you look at First Aid Beauty and Native as good examples, we've been able to bring these brands in, built on their existing sales basis, expand distribution, expand innovation, and marketing support across channels, and significantly grow both the net sales and value base. So the beauty organization's ability to take these small brands maintain their character and user base and apply our strength to grow them, is actually very promising. And that's the underlying hypothesis and reason why we believe these three acquisitions will create significant value for beauty as well. Their approach of bringing these brands in is also unique in the sense that the beauty organization is really taking time to bring the visiting organization into the P&G ecosystem, have them operate more independently than we've done in the past, to ensure that the character of the brand and the key strength of the brand are maintained, and then we carefully build on top. So high confidence based on previous experience would be my summary.\nJon Moeller: Let me just add a couple things here. Wendy. Our beauty business, historically has been built this way. So we acquired for example, Old Spice, we acquired Olay. Pantene, and Head & Shoulders were tiny. We're talking less than $100 million in sales, and how they're two of the largest shampoos in the world. That doesn't give us any guarantee. But it certainly as Andre was indicating a strong track record to build from. That's point one. Point two, relative to the company's ability to handle M&A and by the way, and spending time on this, I'm not suggesting that the emphasis or focus has shifted in that direction by any stretch of the imagination. The best example that I can point to because we've had the longest track record with it is the Merck OTC acquisition, different category, but so far an incredibly successful acquisition. Our OTC business grew at 20% and the quarter that we just completed and it's doing so very profitably Having said all that, probably more than any other person and I don't mean to personalize this. I've got more blood on my back from cleaning up lots of small brands. I spent four years of my life doing it. We are going to be very disciplined. And we'll get an early read on whether we think things are going to work according to plan or not. And if not, we'll pivot.\nOperator: All right, next question will come from the line of Nick Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a housekeeping or follow up? And then a broader question, on the follow up Andre, is there any way you can provide any quantification on the out of stock impact on organic revenue growth this quarter? And then the broader question, I guess this would be for you, Jon is just when you think about the consumer and segmentation strategy at P&G, if you think about the Gen Z consumer, do you think that you have the core brand set is broad enough to reach that consumer? Do you feel like you need to, launch new brands or, make some of these acquisitions that you've discussed, we've been discussing during this call to really cater to those particular consumers? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Nick, on the first part of the question, I can't really give you a number, it's impossible to estimate I can give you anecdotal evidence of what we're seeing. When you think about Oral-B iO, for example, $299 Toothbrush, very premium item. And obviously, we're impacted by the chips shortage just as everybody else. And we the demand, the consumer demand for that product, despite the price point is significantly higher than anything we can deliver. That's probably on the extreme end, because for chips, there's limited alternatives available. But there is some impact, it's just not possible to give you a meaningful number at this point.\nJon Moeller: But directionally Nick, which is what leads you to your question, there is no doubt. At present, the demand is stronger than supply. Andre is absolutely right. I don't know how to quantify it either. But as we address some of the opportunities, and that's how I view it within the supply community there should be upside beyond kind of our internal forecasts and what you might expect. That's assuming, of course, that demand continues at current levels. Relative to Gen Z consumers, and you proffered several avenues to reach and delight those consumers, I think, all are on the table. There's another group of consumers that we're working to expand our coverage to, and we're frankly underdeveloped. And that's the multicultural consumer and the U.S. as an example. The good news is, these are the same consumers, the multicultural consumer, or the Gen Z population is multicultural by definition. So in terms of having a size of prize here, that's that merits consideration of all the choices you mentioned. It's significant, and we're all over it.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to dive into the updated commodity outlook a bit. I know there are a lot of moving pieces here. And Andre, you mentioned, chemicals and diesel are moving higher. But you also say that you're not really seeing relief across the other buckets. So just we would be curious, like, what are you seeing in commodities like pulp and resin, which seems to be trending marginally lower, at least versus where we more back in September, and October? And then maybe building on that just on the phasing of gross margin in the second half building on Steven and Jason's questions earlier, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but your responses imply that 332, gross margin will be under pressure, but an improvement sequentially as pricing bills, productivity brands and cost pressures are in the base and, and based on where things stand now that you could return to gross margin expansion in fourth year. I know a lot can change over the next six months. But is that a fair read based on where we are today? Or are there other impacts? I'm not really thinking of that could impact that trajectory? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, to begin with the commodity guidance. Within our guidance, we see 44% increase across all commodity classes so if you take our total basket average, it is up 44%. Chemicals up the highest, no more than 60%, resins up almost 60% pulp up more than 30%, etcetera. So it continues down the line, all of these numbers are in that same range. And we see some reduction in resin prices, for example, or in Pulp prices from a temporary peak. But when we look at Q2 pricing relative to a year ago, resin last quarter or quarter, same quarter last year was $54, it's now 136. When you look about pulp, it's up more than 30%. So there is fluctuation in the short term. But the increases year-over-year continued to be continue to be very material. From a gross margin standpoint, I'll leave it at what I've said before, we'll see sequential progress in the gross margin driven by productivity, pricing and commodity costs coming into the base. I will not go beyond that in terms of giving a forecast just as too many moving pieces at this point in time. So I'll leave it at that. But we reiterate we expect sequential progress.\nOperator: Next we'll come to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the state of the consumer through the implied back half guidance. So you can get more pricing volume comparisons are easy. You raise sales guidance, but basically the level that you had achieved in the first half of the fiscal year. So I wanted to ask, what are the assumptions? Or what are your views of volumes, and just the general consumer outlook in your two key markets of the U.S. and of China? And maybe just to unpack it? One of the fears I think folks have is you're going to start laughing stimulus in the U.S. lower income consumer seems a little weaker, does that factor into your thinking there especially as pricing goes up. And then in China, there's obviously been lockdowns, there's Olympics, is that any sort of consideration as well in terms of your thinking about volume trends there and maybe a switch from traditional retail to offline or to online as well? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: I'll start by saying the consumer continues to favor our brands. Our categories, again, daily use essential needs of the consumer and health, hygiene and cleaning. And the efficacy of our products and brands really helps us with the priority that we can provide to trade the consumer up within our portfolio. And as we take pricing, we see a lower reaction from the consumer in terms of price elasticity than what we would have seen in the past to give you some concrete data. In the U.S. we see on those brands where we've taken pricing in September and October, which are normally highly price elastic. We've seen price elasticity in the range of 20% to 30% lower than what we would have expected based on historic data. So we take comfort in the strength of our brands, the broad based growth of the portfolio globally, the broad based growth of portfolio across categories, and the short term reaction of the consumers as we take pricing and our ability to combine that pricing with innovation, which actually then stimulates the consumer to trade up in everything that we've seen. We assume, I think we hope that as some of the stimulus payments, phase out, labor rate participation will increase and hopefully one level of income will be replaced by another to be seen, but everything that we see at the moment. The combination of our categories being essential and relative consumer strength, give us confidence for the volume growth also in the second half. The only thing I will say on China. The elements that will help us here is hopefully with COVID easing and the regional lockdowns disappearing. That should be a positive driver of growth in China, but too early to confirm obviously.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the metric of 75%, superiority of your portfolio, obviously it's helped you immensely over the past few years. And in terms of kind of gaining market share or what have you, but I think we've been at 75% for about three, if not four years now. So just is that kind of the ceiling would be one question? Has the pandemic really slowed down your R&D pipeline, kind of with trying just to fill the supply chain, not wanting to roll out as many new products or, just any color around that? Is this as good as it gets? Or can we expect that to move to a higher number over the next few years as you kind of ramp up R&D? Thanks so much.\nAndre Schulten: I think the numerical stability of 75% might be misleading here, because it's not static at all. Once we reach in a category, call it 80%, 90% of superiority, we reset the benchmark to ensure that we look to the next frontier in terms of where the consumer would go, what really is relevant here for the consumer. So one example on single unit dose. For example, we've changed the benchmark from competitive single unit dose offering to actually test whether our Tide Pods are strong enough to incent consumers to trade up from liquid detergent to single unit oats. That's the new measure when you change that measure the percentage ink decreases, which is implied and is the intent. So the strategy of superiority is really dynamic. And if we were ever to reach 99%, we would have done something wrong, because we would have not looked at the external environment and as it evolves. Jon, anything you want to add here?\nJon Moeller: Just to the point of Bill's question on innovation. We've called out many times our supply organization. Our innovation organization deserves tremendous credit. You don't contribute disproportionately to market growth across our breadth of categories. And as a result, grow share past three, six and 12 months, a nine out of 10 categories without an incredible innovation, capability and effort. And one of the first things we did as we were meeting every morning, literally daily, when COVID started was to figure out what were the health protocols that would allow us to get our R&D colleagues back in the office working together, collaborating, innovating and creating superior offerings as quickly as possible. And they've, it's it, there are certainly challenges. But they've done a tremendous job of keeping this pipeline intact. And I've never felt better about our innovation capability in our ability as Andre describes to keep raising the bar on superiority.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Chris Pitcher with Redburn.\nChris Pitcher: Thanks very much for the question. Just going back to China, could you say in this environment, you're seeing increased local competition rather than just a softer market, and especially in reference to say skin, hair, and fabric? And if so whether this competition is more promotional led, as you may have suggested, or whether you're seeing an improvement in local product quality and functionality, and in the context of China looking to build its own domestic production capabilities of what can you just confirm what percentage of your sales are made in the mainland? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Almost all of our products that are consumed in China are made in China. Local competition is strong and continues to get stronger, which is a good thing. It's a constructive force in the market, it leads to market growth and expansion that leads to positive consumer experiences with a category or a segment. And it's something that we welcome. I don't have specific numbers for you in terms of progress of local versus international offerings, but that's current status. And I know it's not why you asked your question, but there have been understandably a fair number of questions on China. I would just draw your view as Andre said earlier, importantly, at any point in time, at any quarter, we're going to have challenges. Those challenges so far haven't led to major business loss. They've, they've led to grow slowdown in some cases which we've fully offset in other parts of the world. It's a pretty incredible feat. Sorry for the self-congratulatory tone. But I'm really congratulated in the broad organization to have flat growth in a quarter and your second largest market and deliver over 6% top line growth, it really speaks to the strength of the portfolio, the strength of the strategy, which I'll come back to at the very end of this call.\nOperator: And your last question will come from the line of Camilo Garcia Walla with Credit Suisse.\nCamilo Garcia Walla: Thank you, everybody. Good morning. Two questions. One following up on Mark's question about the state of the consumer. Obviously, it's healthy at the moment; your view is that continues to stay healthy. But can you talk a little bit about any guardrails you may have been placed in case that that changes quickly in case the impact of inflation really starts to turn on impact the consumer? Obviously there's stimulus, Child Tax Credit, these sorts of things. And then secondly, can you provide a little more detail on what pricing is going to look like outside of the United States versus domestically, specifically, so that as we start to see the data coming through in the coming months, we have a good understanding of what we're seeing here and how it may compare to what's happening elsewhere? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, I'll start I'm sure Jon has a few points to add. On the consumer state, I think in terms of guardrails, what I tell you the strongest guardrails and mitigations we have are the strength of the portfolio. We're innovating across price tiers, we are building pricing out in a way that price tiers remain accessible for the consumer key cash always remain accessible. And so within the portfolio that we have, depending on the strength of the consumer, they will find an offering that matches their affordability level, their cash outlay level and still give them a superior performance versus the competitive PSS. Important to know that superiority does not mean that we're trying to trade up the consumer or trying to innovate only at the top end of the portfolio. Superiority is defined as Superiority at each price tier to the competing. So the price ladder remains intact and we innovate across and that's probably the best protection we can offer at this point in an inflationary environment. The pricing we take outside the U.S. is very similar to what you see in the U.S. broad range across categories. And about mid singles is what I will tell you. In addition to that we're taking pricing for significant variation [ph] in some markets, mainly Turkey to mention to recover short term margin there. But broadly, I would guide you to mid singles around the world on 60%, 70% of the portfolio, similar to what we have done.\nJon Moeller: So I just have a couple closing comments; one on pricing. Remember, pricing is an inherent part of our business model. As an innovation centered company, we aim to create products that address better every day, consumer needs and problems and can typically command some pricing while increasing the overall value proposition to consumers with those more efficacious offerings. Pricing has been a positive component of our top line for 42 over the last 45 quarters and 17 out of the last 18 years. So while the level of pricing we're talking about here, to be fair, is typically a different level. This is not a dynamic that we're unfamiliar with. And as Andre said earlier, we certainly have significant historical and recent experience in developing markets. None of that's a guarantee, but this is not new territory. Last thing I want to leave you with there will be bumps in this road. There will be cases where we take pricing and we either encounter the consumer reaction that some of you are rightly looking to or a competitive reaction there is no doubt in my mind that there will be bumps in this road. But so far, it's going very well. Related to that there has never been more volatility that we're having to manage across the geopolitical spectrum or regulatory spectrum, the whole spectrum, the supply spectrum, the labor spectrum. So I guarantee you, as we said, in the last quarter discussion, that we will encounter sources of volatility and degrees of volatility that's sitting here today, we can't imagine. That's been true each day, week and month of the last two years. And so when you look at any one variable or one scenario, it's difficult to find relevance. My encouragement is to reflect back to strategy, portfolio, ability to execute. So identify those companies that will get through this the best, albeit with bumps on the road. And I think we've demonstrated thus far, incredible strength of portfolio of strategy of execution. And we're committed to keep that going. We're here the balance of the day, Jon is, Andre is and don't hesitate to contact us.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, everyone. That concludes the call for today. Thank you for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "I would just add, Lauren, that, Omicron hasn't helped. It further pressurizes the dynamics that Andre spoke about, and it just reduces the resources we have available at any point in time to work on these things. When - as people become infected and need to quarantine, as they need to take care of family members, as children's schools are closed, all of those things have a real impact, which to Andre's point, should lighten as hopefully, everyone on the call, please cross your fingers as we go forward. I just want to underscore something that Andre said. Remember, that the pricing that we've announced, even the pricing has taken effect at shelf. We didn't have a full quarter benefit from the quarter we just completed. So that's simple roll forward is a help. And the majority of the pricing that we've announced has not yet taken place. Yes. Good morning, Jason. On the commodity and transportation warehousing timing, yes, I mean, I assume your math is right. I won't check it here. But we can certainly follow up as needed. We assume in our forecast in our guidance, spot prices for both the commodity basket and for transportation and warehousing. We've seen increases still in this last cycle as reflected in the increase in commodities and transportation and warehousing. But we're also seeing a slower rate of increase. So hopefully, meaning that we reach the peak here soon. But we are building our financial forecast and all financial planning on that level. So we don't assume any easing in terms of transportation and warehousing or commodity cost impact or foreign exchange for that matter. And just a reminder of the obvious, we're dealing with commodity costs increases that affect every competitor, both multinational and local, which changes the dynamic pretty considerably versus for example, pricing for foreign exchange, which has a differential impact across the competitive set. So it's not an easy job, but it's an easier job than we've managed, as Andre says successfully manage geographies in the recent past. Hey Kevin, this is Jon. A couple points on large M&A. The first very, very important point is we like our current portfolio. We have confidence that we can create value with that portfolio. And, frankly, all parts of it are working. Andre mentioned that, we're growing market share in nine out of 10 of those categories. And importantly, that market share growth is not taking business. It's creating business in large part affecting the overall growth of the market. So we're in a very healthy situation with a very healthy portfolio that's underpinned with a clear set of priorities and a very effective tightly integrated set of strategies. And we're adding, we're strengthening our strategic execution by a focus on four areas. One is supply. The second is digital competence across the value chain. The third is employee value. And the fourth is sustainability. We like that hand overall. Second point, our algorithm growing slightly ahead of the market with EPS up mid-to-high singles, assumes 100% organic growth. So again, we don't need large M&A to deliver against that. And we certainly haven't utilized large M&A in the last four or five year period when we've been delivering very regularly on that expectation. A couple other points, and then I'll get to beauty. And then Andre may have some comments on beauty as well. The -- we have said many times that there that we intend to win in these 10 categories that we've selected. And that acquisition would be a part of the way that we may choose to fill out categories in order to win. And we've talked about two categories in particular, that would be particularly focus areas. One is skincare, and the other is personal health care. So all of that remains as true. The last point I would make, which is I realized not very helpful to the audience at hand but as a matter of policy, we don't comment further than what I just have on acquisition or divestiture. On beauty, I want to clarify what I think has been a little bit of a misunderstanding. When we made the portfolio decisions as to what we were going to move out on beauty and what we were going to stay in. We did not make price tier decisions. We did not exit premium beauty, we made category decisions. And we exited several categories that were more discretionary, that were not daily use, and where performance had a lower role in driving brand choice. So for example, we maintained our most premium beauty offering SK-II. So this notion that we're, we got out of a price tier and now we're getting back in is not the way to think about it. We got out of categories. And we're strengthening those categories. And these the brands that we have purchased, as Andre said earlier play in the premium portion of the beauty categories, which are the fastest growing from a market standpoint to date, and obviously give us ample opportunity to create value given their margin structure. Andre, anything to add. Morning. Our ability to supply is relatively stable, is stable actually. If you look at our on-shelf availability, for example in the U.S. Last quarter, we reported that was around 94%, we're still running at about 94% which is not where we want to be which will be more than 98%, 99% range. But good relative to peer group and good given again the overall challenges the industry is seeing, the retail environment seeing. So and that is true around the world. Our supply chain people who deserve all the credit here continue to do an absolutely amazing job making sure that our retail partners have the products available that our consumers want to buy. And there are no major outages given the flexibility we've created within the supply chain. Even in China as we saw regional lockdowns, we were able to shift production into alternative sites and thereby maintain supply. So continued great work while supply organization relatively stable situation, we'll continue to monitor closely because this is not over. So great success now with no guarantee for the future, but we certainly feel well positioned. Just a couple of additional points on SK-II to hopefully make it clear and bring it to life what's actually happening here. If you dramatically simplify the SK-II business, you would simplify it historically into two primary channels. One is travel retail and the other is department store. And in both of those channels, it was it's typically been a council product, meaning there's some but there's a knowledgeable person in the store to help you understand the benefits of the product and which elements are right for you. With COVID, travel retail largely closed, in many parts of Asia and ability of counsellors to go to work for the multitude of reasons we're all familiar with, including some regulatory prohibitions. If you look at Japan, you have that dynamic plus you have what was a major source of business, which was Chinese travelers going to Japan to department stores, to buy a product to bring back to their friends and family. That's not happening. So when you ask, why is SK-II, currently soft? Those are the reasons. And as Andre indicated, it has nothing to do with the equity or strength of the brand. We've converted. And I really applaud the team for doing this, a fair amount of that purchase, from those channels to more local channels that support longer -- consumption. But still, the impact of this has been significant. Let me just add a couple things here. Wendy. Our beauty business, historically has been built this way. So we acquired for example, Old Spice, we acquired Olay. Pantene, and Head & Shoulders were tiny. We're talking less than $100 million in sales, and how they're two of the largest shampoos in the world. That doesn't give us any guarantee.

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Q2 was a strong quarter, very strong top line growth, sequential earnings progress in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong cash productivity. Our progress enables us to confirm fiscal year EPS guidance while increasing our estimates for top line growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners. Organic sales grew more than 6%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth, pricing added 3 points as September/October price increases flow through, and as year-on-year promotion comparisons normalize, mix was neutral for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew our health organic sales in the quarter, Personal Health Care grew 20%, Fabric Care and Feminine Care were up double digits, Baby Care up high singles, Grooming grew mid singles. Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low single-digit. Family Care organic sales were in line with prior year. Focus Markets grew 6% and Enterprise Markets were up 7% In Focus Markets, U.S. organic sales were up 9% despite 12% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 21%. Europe Focus Markets were up 5%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year against the strong 12% bass period comp and due to slower market growth in the quarter. In addition, we took proactive steps in the quarter to encourage our network of distributors to reduce inventory levels to reflect short-term consumer demand softness in the market. Latin America led the growth in Enterprise Markets up 15%. Global aggregate market share increased 60 basis points, 38 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn share growth for P&G. All general market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew nearly 3.5% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow up nearly 1.5 points versus same quarter last year now at 34%. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12 month periods in the U.S. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands and superior performance they provide even as inflation is impacting household budgets. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.66, up 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 2%. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 410 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impact combined were a 460 basis points hit to gross margins. Mix was 140 basis points headwind, mainly from product mix impacts. Productivity savings and pricing each provided partial offsets to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&,A advertising spending increased versus prior year as we continue to invest to communicate the superiority of our brands. However, overall marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points, driven by sales leverage and savings in non-working marketing costs. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 240 basis points. Productivity improvements were 150 basis point help to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 106%. We returned nearly $7 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, while input cost and supply chains remained challenging, we delivered good results for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, keeping us on track to deliver our going-in earnings estimates and to raise estimates for sales, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, which I'll come back to later. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stays focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis, and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that has been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth and our categories. This drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. The superiority model works in each of our categories. Take the three category growth drivers this quarter: Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, and Feminine Care, very different categories, different competitors, different geographic footprints, and different materials and manufacturing processes, each delivering superiority and each growing organic sales double digits. In each of these categories P&G is driving a disproportionate share of overall category value growth growing the pie for all participants. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases, we closed couple price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within the P&L and balance sheet to support balance top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes through the mind set of constructive disruption, of willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields are more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices of portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn growth shares, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis have served us well during these volatile times, and we're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving on to guidance, we said last quarter that we would undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. The Omicron variant has certainly proven this to be correct. As we saw in the first half of the fiscal year, growth, results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects. Along with these realities of current year cost pressures, foreign exchange, volatility and continued effects of the global pandemic on supply chains and consumer behavior. Transportation and labor markets remain tight, availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad based with little sign of near term relief. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. The recent spike in virus cases and resulting lockdowns, increase the risk of additional work stoppages in our operations or in those of our suppliers. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Since our last update, we've seen continued increases in diesel and chemicals with little offset and other materials. Trade costs have continued to increase, we now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $300 million after tax headwind for fiscal 2022. Foreign exchange rates have also moved against us since our last guidance, we now expect FX to be a $200 million after tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We will offset a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. We've now announced price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the U.S. increases in Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, Hair Care, Grooming, Oral Care, Skincare, are now effective in market. We also increased prices on mid-tier liquid detergents, and powder detergents over the last few months. In mid-December, we announced to retailers that effective February 28 we are increasing pricing on the balance of our Fabric Care portfolio. This includes Tide, Gain, Downy Bounce at unstoppables, and includes all forms liquid and unit-dose detergents, scent beads, liquid fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Just yesterday, we announced to retailers that we are increasing pricing on certain personal healthcare brands in the U.S. effective mid-April. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one size fits all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity freight and foreign exchange impacts. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to the key metric guidance. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year, up from our initial range of 2% to 4%. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reaches store shelves we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. So far, we haven't seen noticeable changes in consumer behavior. Demand for our best performing premium priced offerings remains very strong as to our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're confirming our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of 3% to 6%. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.8 billion after tax headwind for fiscal 2022 earnings, or roughly $1.10 per share, a 20 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands, as pricing goes into effect and as we annualize the initial spike in input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity to 95%. And we are raising our guidance for cash return to share owners. We continue to expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends. And we now plan to repurchase $9 billion to $10 billion of common stock combined a plan to return $17 billion to $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates commodity price and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis that we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage to the near term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balance top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. All right. Good morning, Dara, that's a lot. So let me start with maybe two and focus on Beauty and China within that. Look, if you look at our Beauty business over a longer period of time, the business has actually delivered about $3 billion in incremental sales over the past five years, more than $1 billion of incremental profit, significant contribution to shareholder return, 25 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, including this quarter. When we look at this quarter on a two-year stack, on Beauty, it's 7% for quarter two, quarter one was a 9% stack. The Health Care growing 2%, Skin and Personal Care growing 3%. So we feel good about the overall performance of the Beauty business and the strength of the core portfolio. There is significant runway, I'll comment on China in a minute. We certainly saw a slowdown in some of the Beauty portfolio, namely SK-II which we've mentioned before, store closures of department stores, lower traffic there, and also slower key consumption periods in some of the China events. And honestly, our unwillingness to go into very deep discount levels on the brand have contributed to a slower growth in quarter two. Overall, the portfolio is strong. We believe has very strong growth potential in the future. We are also excited about the acquisitions we've announced. Tula, Farmacy Beauty and Ouai, all focused on the premium end of the trade in the U.S. premium consumers, which is a giving up opportunity for additional top line growth and value creation in the U.S. and also globally. On China, I'll start with a similar comment. China, over the past four or five years, has delivered high singles or low-teens sales growth. We have a stable or very strong brands. We continue to believe that consumption after a weaker period in quarter one, as you have seen, and quarter two in the market. Consumption in our categories were returned to mid singles and we feel well-positioned to benefit from that growth with a strong organization, strong supply chain and strong R&D capability on the ground. The other point to note even with China being flat in the quarter, from a global perspective, we were able to grow more than 6%. And part of that is the strength of the geographic portfolio that we need to focus on because in some markets, we might have to invest. China certainly is at this point in time, as you point out weaker in an overall - from an overall consumption standpoint. So I'll stop there. I'm sure we'll get back to your other questions and some of the other comments, Dara. Yes. Good morning, Lauren. Productivity, the number of 80 basis points in the quarter, we expect about $800 million BT productivity contribution from cost of goods for the year. And it's a little bit lighter than what we would have done in previous years. But most importantly, we remain fully committed to productivity as a core driver of margin expansion. In the short-term, there are a couple of effects that I want to spend a minute on. Number one, when you think about cost savings projects, they require line time, that line time is competing with the need to ship cases in a very constrained supply chain. When we think about innovation, we talk frequently about our desire to close copper price increases with innovation. Innovation also needs lifetime. So cost savings projects on the line also compete with innovation, and they compete with our desire and need to ship the business. Therefore, in a constrained environment, as you point out, our businesses make the decision to focus on innovation, focus on shipping the business, which is better for retailers, better for consumers, better for us in terms of value creation, but it has an impact on cost savings. The good news is these cost savings are available to us in the future, they don't go anywhere. But you see a little bit slower ramp up in that context. Second element I would mention is the global pressure on supply chain. And the flexibility that we talked about that our supply people have generated, doesn't come for free. So when we need to shift to alternate materials, when we need to shift to alternate suppliers, or sources of materials geographically, that comes as a premium, which goes against productivity, again, the right choice, because shipping the cases is financially more viable than creating the cost saving. But it has an impact. And then the last point I'll make is, negotiating commercial savings when everyone is trying to get the materials in sufficient quantity is also a bit more difficult. So all of that to say short-term, pressure, longer-term, fully committed to productivity being a core driver of margin expansion and balance growth model. and you see progress quarter by quarter. Good morning, Steve. Alright, so from a growth margin perspective, a couple of things will come to play here. If you will assume that the existing commodity foreign exchange rate and transportation warehousing pressures remain at this level, which is our basis for planning, we will benefit from more pricing flowing through the P&L. Most of all price increases that you've seen in our prepared remarks have gone, or some have gone into effect in September and October, but the majority of the price increases are still coming into effect over December, quarter one, quarter three and quarter four. So the contribution of pricing both to gross margin recover as well as to the price mix line within the top line is going to increase sequentially, as we go through the fiscal year. We also will see in the base period, the commodity pressures are coming into the base gross margin, starting with the third quarter, and then really flowing in the fourth quarter based comparison. So that's going to help the gross margin comparison as well. And lastly, the continuation of hopefully, more stability in the labor force more stability around COVID as we exit this winter, will allow us to increase contribution from productivity as I've talked before, which will also help gross margin recovery in the second half. On the pricing contribution versus volume contribution, I expect price to become a bigger part as I said logically because of the timing of the price increases that we have announced. And in terms of ability to sustain the pricing, we have seen for the price increases where we have sufficient read period at this point in time, we have seen a more benign reaction of the consumer, the consumer is healthy generally, and is preferring our brands, we're starting with strong security and price elasticity has generally been lower than what would we what would what we would have seen historically, which also speaks to the fact that we hopefully will continue to see volume growth in combination with a stronger price growth in the background. Very good morning, Robert. If I step back I think we're better positioned for dealing with an inflationary environment or revenue management in that sense than we've ever been before. Starting with a portfolio that is focused on daily use categories health, hygiene and cleaning that are essential to the consumer versus discretionary categories, which in these environments are the first ones to lose focus from the consumer. Secondly, starting with a portfolio that is 75% superior by our assessment and reflected probably in the market share results and trends that we're seeing. We also over time have built much stronger price letters. So we have offerings for the consumer at different price points, and different cash outlays. When you think about diapers, you can get a Luvs diaper for $0.15 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.30, or Pure diaper at $0.38. And that's generally true across all categories across all brands. So that means the consumer has a choice within our portfolio. So in that sense, I think we are set up well, from a starting point to deal with inflation and related pricing. From an execution standpoint, I think we also benefit from a couple of things. Number one, the organizational redesign in focus markets and enterprise markets enables much faster and much clearer decision making, which is critical in these processes, and also much more diligence in terms of where to take pricing, country brand SKU level. And the other element here is that from an execution standpoint, we certainly have seen that innovation can play a significant role. And the strength of our innovation pipeline, and our ability to combine pricing with innovation is certainly helping us in this environment. That's what I make. And then Jon will probably have comments here as well. We've been operating in high inflation environments around the world for many years. Think about Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, those are high inflation markets and environments. So we know how to deal with that. Obviously, we hope we don't get to that place, but generally well positioned for the reasons I tried to outline here. Nothing to add. Alright, good morning. On SK-II, certainly no ceiling for the brand in terms of growth. The brand continues to carry enormous equity with existing users, enormous appeal to new users, specifically in the, in the Asia space. So we continue to be very encouraged by both the current strength of the brand, but also by the future pipeline and the initiatives that are to come. But the brand is operating in channels that are most impacted by the pandemic, that has an impact on our business, it has an impact on total consumption. And lastly, I mentioned this in the earlier question. We don't believe that heavy discounting is the right strategy in the short term to overcome some of these challenges. So we're focusing on building the equity building product efficacy, and running our business model to return to stronger growth here in the future. On the Baby category, your right price mix when you look at the U.S. but also globally is increasing, which is encouraging for two reasons encouraging number one; Baby Care is one of the hardest hit categories from a commodity impact. So it's good to see that the pricing that was taken is flowing through to the P&L to help with productivity, offset some of that commodity pressure. And we see the pricing in Baby flowing through really globally. So that's a core driver, and every player in the industry, as Jon mentioned before, has to find a way to offset these cost pressures that are very significant in this category. More encouraging to me is in our portfolio, the desire of the consumer to move up to higher premium offerings because they truly provide better value for the consumer. When you think about the U.S., for example, most of the growth, if not the absolute majority of the growth comes from tier one, our smallest proposition comes from Cruisers 360, which is a very unique proposition in the pants form for active babies, comes from Pampers Pure, and comes from Ninjamas, which is a bedwetting product, which we re-entered the category created significant growth in the category and build a 9% share position. So the portfolio strategy we're executing the innovation, we're bringing is rewarded by the consumer with trade up and that is a significant contributor to price mix. And hopefully and I think sustainable given the true benefits where we're seeing the consumer appreciate. Yes, very good. So when we have these discussion on is their value in integrating the small tuck-in acquisitions, we're obviously asking the exact same question. And the track record within beauty is actually very good. When you look at First Aid Beauty and Native as good examples, we've been able to bring these brands in, built on their existing sales basis, expand distribution, expand innovation, and marketing support across channels, and significantly grow both the net sales and value base. So the beauty organization's ability to take these small brands maintain their character and user base and apply our strength to grow them, is actually very promising. And that's the underlying hypothesis and reason why we believe these three acquisitions will create significant value for beauty as well. Their approach of bringing these brands in is also unique in the sense that the beauty organization is really taking time to bring the visiting organization into the P&G ecosystem, have them operate more independently than we've done in the past, to ensure that the character of the brand and the key strength of the brand are maintained, and then we carefully build on top. So high confidence based on previous experience would be my summary. Nick, on the first part of the question, I can't really give you a number, it's impossible to estimate I can give you anecdotal evidence of what we're seeing. When you think about Oral-B iO, for example, $299 Toothbrush, very premium item. And obviously, we're impacted by the chips shortage just as everybody else. And we the demand, the consumer demand for that product, despite the price point is significantly higher than anything we can deliver. That's probably on the extreme end, because for chips, there's limited alternatives available. But there is some impact, it's just not possible to give you a meaningful number at this point. Yes, to begin with the commodity guidance. Within our guidance, we see 44% increase across all commodity classes so if you take our total basket average, it is up 44%. Chemicals up the highest, no more than 60%, resins up almost 60% pulp up more than 30%, etcetera. So it continues down the line, all of these numbers are in that same range. And we see some reduction in resin prices, for example, or in Pulp prices from a temporary peak. But when we look at Q2 pricing relative to a year ago, resin last quarter or quarter, same quarter last year was $54, it's now 136. When you look about pulp, it's up more than 30%. So there is fluctuation in the short term. But the increases year-over-year continued to be continue to be very material. From a gross margin standpoint, I'll leave it at what I've said before, we'll see sequential progress in the gross margin driven by productivity, pricing and commodity costs coming into the base. I will not go beyond that in terms of giving a forecast just as too many moving pieces at this point in time. So I'll leave it at that. But we reiterate we expect sequential progress. I'll start by saying the consumer continues to favor our brands. Our categories, again, daily use essential needs of the consumer and health, hygiene and cleaning. And the efficacy of our products and brands really helps us with the priority that we can provide to trade the consumer up within our portfolio. And as we take pricing, we see a lower reaction from the consumer in terms of price elasticity than what we would have seen in the past to give you some concrete data. In the U.S. we see on those brands where we've taken pricing in September and October, which are normally highly price elastic. We've seen price elasticity in the range of 20% to 30% lower than what we would have expected based on historic data. So we take comfort in the strength of our brands, the broad based growth of the portfolio globally, the broad based growth of portfolio across categories, and the short term reaction of the consumers as we take pricing and our ability to combine that pricing with innovation, which actually then stimulates the consumer to trade up in everything that we've seen. We assume, I think we hope that as some of the stimulus payments, phase out, labor rate participation will increase and hopefully one level of income will be replaced by another to be seen, but everything that we see at the moment. The combination of our categories being essential and relative consumer strength, give us confidence for the volume growth also in the second half. The only thing I will say on China. The elements that will help us here is hopefully with COVID easing and the regional lockdowns disappearing. That should be a positive driver of growth in China, but too early to confirm obviously. I think the numerical stability of 75% might be misleading here, because it's not static at all. Once we reach in a category, call it 80%, 90% of superiority, we reset the benchmark to ensure that we look to the next frontier in terms of where the consumer would go, what really is relevant here for the consumer. So one example on single unit dose. For example, we've changed the benchmark from competitive single unit dose offering to actually test whether our Tide Pods are strong enough to incent consumers to trade up from liquid detergent to single unit oats. That's the new measure when you change that measure the percentage ink decreases, which is implied and is the intent. So the strategy of superiority is really dynamic. And if we were ever to reach 99%, we would have done something wrong, because we would have not looked at the external environment and as it evolves. Jon, anything you want to add here? Yes, I'll start I'm sure Jon has a few points to add. On the consumer state, I think in terms of guardrails, what I tell you the strongest guardrails and mitigations we have are the strength of the portfolio. We're innovating across price tiers, we are building pricing out in a way that price tiers remain accessible for the consumer key cash always remain accessible. And so within the portfolio that we have, depending on the strength of the consumer, they will find an offering that matches their affordability level, their cash outlay level and still give them a superior performance versus the competitive PSS. Important to know that superiority does not mean that we're trying to trade up the consumer or trying to innovate only at the top end of the portfolio. Superiority is defined as Superiority at each price tier to the competing. So the price ladder remains intact and we innovate across and that's probably the best protection we can offer at this point in an inflationary environment. The pricing we take outside the U.S. is very similar to what you see in the U.S. broad range across categories. And about mid singles is what I will tell you. In addition to that we're taking pricing for significant variation [ph] in some markets, mainly Turkey to mention to recover short term margin there. But broadly, I would guide you to mid singles around the world on 60%, 70% of the portfolio, similar to what we have done."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, currently Vice Chair and incoming President and Chief Executive Officer as of November 1st; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. The July to September quarter provides a good start to the fiscal year, putting us on track to deliver our guidance for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash return to share owners. We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top line growth and strong cost savings kept EPS growth nearly in line with prior year. Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up. So moving to first quarter results, organic sales grew 4%, volume contributed 2 points of sales growth, pricing, and mix each added 1 point. Growth was broad-based across business units with nine out of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Healthcare, up double digits; Fabric Care grew high singles; Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming, up mid singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care, and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low single digits. Family Care declined mid singles, comping very strong growth in the base period. Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S., despite 16% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 20%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year due to strong growth in the base period comp and due to intra-quarter softness and beauty market growth. On a two-year stack basis, organic China organic sales are up 12% in line to slightly ahead of underlying market growth. Focused markets grew 4% for the quarter and enterprise markets were up 5%. E-commerce sales grew 16% versus prior year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in term share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew mid-single digits this quarter and P&G value share continued to grow to over 34%. We are up more than a 1.5 versus first quarter last year. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based; 9 of 10 product categories grew share over the past three months with the 10th improving to flat versus year-ago over the past one month. Consumers are continuing to prefer P&G brands. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.61, down 1% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS declined 3%, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs, which we highlighted in our initial outlook for the year. Core gross margin decreased 370 basis points and currency neutral core gross margin was down 390 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were 400 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was an 80 basis points headwind, primarily due to geographic impacts. Productivity, savings, pricing, and foreign exchange provided a partial offset to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&A, marketing expense as a percentage of sales was in line with prior year level for the quarter, increasing more than 5% in absolute dollars consistent with all-in sales growth. Core operating margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core operating margin declined 270 basis points. Productivity improvements were 180 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. We returned nearly $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2.2 billion in dividends and approximately $2.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, in the context of a very challenging cost environment, good results across top line, bottom line, and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into these challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies, and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily used products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth. In our categories, this drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment, and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin extension, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business; no area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and to create new trends of technology that will shape the industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies, they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales, and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis and have served us well during the volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategy framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving onto guidance. We will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through this fiscal year. As we saw this quarter, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with the realities of currency and cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Supply chains are under pressure from tight labor markets, tight transportation markets, and overall capacity constraints. Inflationary pressures are broad-based and sustained. Foreign exchange rates add more volatility to this mix. We have also experienced some short-term disruptions in materials availability in several regions around the world. Our purchasing R&D and logistics experts have done a great job managing these challenges. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made, and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Input costs have continued to rise since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.1 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Fiscal costs have -- freight costs have also continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of this higher cost with price increases and with productivity savings. As discussed last quarter and in the more recent investor conferences, we've announced price increases in the U.S. on portions of our Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, and Fabric Care businesses. In the last few weeks, we've also announced to retailers in the U.S. that we will increase prices on segments of our Grooming, Skin Care, and Oral Care businesses. The degree of timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand, and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impact. As always, we will look to close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. As we've said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. I will go First Quarter results confirm our guidance ranges for the Fiscal year across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Our solid start to the Fiscal year increases our confidence in the upper half of this range. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reach store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. While it's still early in the pricing cycle, we haven't seen notable changes in consumer behavior. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%, despite the increased cost challenges we're facing. Foreign exchange is now expected to be neutral to after-tax earnings compared to the modest tailwind we estimated at the start of the year. Considering FX was a modest help to first quarter earnings, we're projecting it to be a headwind for the balance of the year. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight, and foreign exchange is now a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for Fiscal '22 earnings, or roughly $0.90 per share, a 16% point headwind to core EPS growth. This is $500 million after-tax of incremental cost pressure versus our initial outlook for the year. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands. So while we are not changing our core EPS guidance range, please take note of these dynamics as you update your outlook for the year. Will face the most significant cost impacts in the first half of the Fiscal year as pricing goes into effect, as savings programs ramp up, and as we begin to annualize the initial spike and input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the year. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock. Combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities on ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products, and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. Will continue to step forward toward our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody. Maybe we can start just on organic growth this quarter and how you view it relative to underlying consumption trends. Specifically, how much of the 4% you think might have been aided by any timing, whether shipment timing or any temporary surges in demand against the backdrop of COVID? I guess it feels to me like maybe U.S. benefited from some of those dynamics and maybe China on the other side of that, but I'd love your perspective and just whether we should be thinking about any adverse correction against the 4% in subsequent quarters. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thank you, Steve. I'll start by saying that overall consumption trends remain strong globally, particularly as you said in the U.S. Markets continue to grow within our categories of daily use, health and hygiene in the range of mid singles. So from a consumption standpoint, consumer behavior continues to elevate the importance of health hygiene and a clean home. More time at home certainly is also a factor. We continue to see elevated consumption on bounty paper towels, for example, by 10%. Charmin bath tissue is still elevated, consuming about 5% with more time at home. So overall consumption trends remained strong and fuel most of the growth. We also have been able to grow share as we've outlined in our prepared remarks. Also, on a global basis, we're up 50 basis points over the past three months and 70 basis points over the past six months. So that's certainly contributing to a stronger position to benefit from that growth. In the U.S., we've reached record share of 34.4% of value share up more than a point. Inventory effects, I would tell you, certainly play a role in some geographies. Mainly in China, we saw some inventory build in the base period, which the reverse is obviously happening in this period. But in the grand scheme of things, they don't really impact our consumption trends and our shipment trends in the quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Why don't we pick up I guess on gross margin, which is obviously really challenged in the quarter for reasons that we know around commodities, freight, broader supply chain issues. So maybe we could just start with your hedge position for commodities, the visibility that you have at this point on the guidance, which is more dire on that front. And then, just broader views as best you can share. I don't know if -- around the supply chain issues, overall expectation in terms of how long these challenges are going to remain a headwind, and just how you're thinking about the cadence of gross margin restoration as you sort of try to get back to low 50% gross margin, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, Kevin. So maybe let me start with the current outlook for commodities. The increases that we are seeing are broad-based across commodity classes. Our forecast is based on spot rates. We are assuming that the spot rates sustain. So all of our productivity programs, all of our pricing programs, all of our innovation programs are based on the assumption that current spot rates, as reflected in the current guidance, will sustain. We do not hedge commodities per se, so the position that you see here is the position as it impacts our P&L. We offset within our natural hedging position within foreign exchange rate, commodity basket and interest rates. That's the best way for us to protect against volatility and the most cost-effective way to protect against volatility. In terms of supply chain dynamics, certainly demand and supply have not balanced globally as we can see. We continue to see pressure on transportation and warehousing. We continue to see driver shortages, diesel increases. And as I mentioned before, across our commodity classes whether it's chemicals, resins, packaging, or pulp, these increases that we've seen as reflected in the current guidance reflects the existing market dynamics. So the best forecast we have is current spot, and that's what we're going to continue to operate against. We will -- as we articulated, I think before and want to reemphasize in this call as well, we will recover these costs over time. We will not sacrifice investment in the business as we do so. So strong productivity programs that are ramping up throughout the fiscal year. Pricing with innovation that we are bringing into the market if we can to improve value at the same time as we take pricing, All straight commodity pricing throughout the year will ease the margin pressures over time. But it will take time to recover the costs and we will intentionally take our time to recover the cost to protect investment in our superiority strategy, which is working well to drive our top line growth and overall balanced growth model.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. So just was looking for a bit more detail on pricing. Can you help us dimensionalize what percent of that portfolio will have pricing plans in place, post the plan pricing you mentioned earlier in a few categories, some cents for the magnitude of pricing. And then I know you're probably not going to want to be too specific on the go-forward, but just any insight on conceptually how you think about implementing pricing offset cost pressures. Is there some point this fiscal year when you think you'll catch up with the dollar cost pressure you're seeing year-over-year with dollar pricing, whether it be Q3 or Q4? Is that unrealistic, just given the magnitude of cost pressures? And then the last point, just where you've taken pricing so far. It sounds like you haven't seen much demand impact. Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit and talk about the risks that -- to market share momentum as you take pricing and how you guys think about that? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Look, we're taking pricing around the globe and it's really a decision that has taken market-by-market, category-by-category and many cases SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market. So broad-based statements are difficult, so let me try to maybe focus on the U.S. here as a good example, and all biggest market. We have now announced pricing in nine out of 10 categories, so very broad-based. Many of these price increases are being implemented -- have been implemented in September or are being implemented over the next, call it, 90 days. You've seen the price increases. We've announced across Baby, Feminine Care, Family Care, they are mid singles. I would expect, even though the price increases on Grooming, Skin Care have just been out and they are different by few -- about the same range. Mid-singles is about the range that I would expect, again, out on the majority of our portfolio at this point. I cannot comment on future price increases, but we'll continue to evolve as the situation evolves in terms of cost and in terms of ability to take more pricing. In terms of recovery of cost, we expect, as we said in our prepared remarks, that the margin situation and the comp situation on core EPS was sequentially improved throughout the fiscal year. We will annualize part of the commodity cost increase starting with Q3. Most of the pricing will also take effect and actually flow through to the bottom line as of Q3. And our productivity programs will significantly ramp up throughout the fiscal year. All of that said, hard to predict exactly what we're going to lend about sequential progress. It's certainly what we are striving for. Most important point, as I said before, we will not reduce investment in the business. We continue to drive marketing spend, we continue to drive investment and superiority to sustain our balanced growth strategy for the mid and long term. Very early to read anything in terms of price elasticity. I will tell you for those price increases that have gone into the market in the U.S., most of them became effective middle of September and we have not seen any material reaction from consumers in terms of volume offtake. So that makes us feel good about our relative position. And obviously, we feel that we should be in a favorable position given the strength of our portfolio. We're going into this pricing round with 75% of our portfolio truly superior. Probably 80% by the time multi-piece pricing thesis hit. And that should give us a relatively strong position with consumers to deliver value in their mind even as we take pricing.\nJon Moeller: Let me just build on Andre's comments with a couple big picture thoughts. Given the inflationary cycle that we're in, how do you want to be positioned? You want to have -- first of all, being in categories that are daily use that are focused -- where performance drives brand choice is a good place to be. Consumers through the pandemic have shifted their consumption in those categories towards trusted performing brands. And you see that even in what's happening with private label market shares, as an example, down in the U.S. over the past 3 months, down in Europe over the same periods of time. None of that is a guarantee for the future but you start in a very good position with a strong superiority profile as Andre has said, and a strong innovation program and investment program to continue that work. Number 2, you want to be dependable. And just one more thing to add to number 1, this is essentially part and parcel of our business model. Sometimes the reaction is -- this -- with this pricing is a new dynamic. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line for 44 out of 47 for the last quarters, and 16 of the last 17 years. Again, no guarantee for the future but we start with a business model that fundamentally supports pricing in a way that is value accretive to consumers. Second, you want to be in a position to minimize the need for pricing through productivity. We're in a better position on that regard than we've ever been. This organization has done a tremendous job, reducing costs and we'll continue to do so. We want to be in a position where you have product available at different price points to appeal to consumers for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. We're in much better position there than we were in the last cycle. So again, none of that is any guarantee for the future, but all of that positions us much better than we've been historically.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about how scale may or may not be benefiting P&G at this time versus what you see from peers, in comparison around the world. So just thinking about access to raw materials, to packaging inputs, ability to get energy and power in some countries. But I was just curious if you could talk a little bit again about availability, access to can puts in energy and how you think P&G is managing through this or will manage through this versus what you see from some other companies out there. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. We are certainly not immune to the stress that is put on the supply chains globally. And we are very thankful to our supply chain teams who have done a tremendous job in developing business continuity plans and executing against those business continuity plans over the past 18 months, 24 months, as supply-chains were stressed throughout the COVID pandemic. The strength of our supply chains is mainly driven by the flexibility that we can create within those supply chains. So strong supplier partnerships around the globe allow us to shift sourcing if we need to from one supplier to another either because of supply not being available or freight lanes not being available to get materials from point A to B. It also allows us to optimize costs to a degree. And we've been doing that over the past few months and we'll continue to do so. We have an ability to reformulate some of our products which we're doing actively without impacting the superiority of the product or any noticeable impact to the consumer. And that gives us flexibility to adjust again to material availability or cost. We also have an organization that looks around the corner, anticipates potential bottlenecks, and then chooses to build inventory. It's either on materials and intermediates or unfinished products to then be able to withdraw from those inventories on a global basis. So it doesn't mean that we build inventory in the same region where we consume, but we have the ability to do that on a global basis. So in that sense, the global footprint is an advantage to us. As I said, we're not immune to any impact here. But if history is any indication of the future, we feel relatively well-positioned because of the strength of our organization here. Of course, if there are any major disruptions to supply chains, we would be exposed just like everyone else. In terms of energy availability, we'll acknowledge that we've obviously been part of some of those curtailments that we've seen in China, for example. But they've not had a material effect of our supply chains. Again, when you think about our ability to potentially source from other regions for a period of time, most of our factories are able to run formula carts and run products for other regions, which gives us flexibility on our footprint to overcome short-term challenges.\nJon Moeller: One other dynamic that feeds into this is the confidence of our suppliers in our business, both in terms of our business momentum. So if they need to make investments to increase their capacity and material availability, the momentum of our business factors directly into that decision. Second and related, the increments of capacity that we can offtake to generate economics at the supplier level that make investments viable. If we were just adding to demand on the margin, it would be a very different equation. So we become a very attractive customer for our suppliers because of both the size and importantly, the momentum of our business.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So just a quick follow-up on the materials question, then I have a broader question. Which materials are you having the most issues with in terms of sourcing? So that's just a follow-up. And then the broader question is -- again, Jon, congrats for getting appointed to CEO for Procter & Gamble. And I wanted to follow up on the comments you made regarding continuing to invest. That is a priority. But what if the cost situation gets worse? What if competitors don't act rationally in pricing? It looks like they will, but what if they don't? As a CEO of Procter & Gamble, what trade-offs are you willing to make? Is there a threshold where you say, \"Hey, look, we have to cut back on investments, could be up to protect margins within the invest -- down the road. \" Any clarity around that would be very helpful.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, Nik. On the materials question, look I think the -- both the run-up and cost is very broad-based across all material classes, and that's the indication of demand to supply situation. It's really different week-by-week. I wouldn't point to any specific material that is structurally more exposed than another. It is really is across the input basket. And again, the dynamics I was describing within all supply chain is how we're dealing with it. And the change is really period by period. On the overall costs trade-off versus strategy. I will start and then I'm sure Jon has a lot to add here. I would say that sticking to our strategy is core and the commitment is relentless. We have over many periods tried to do it in a different way and that is not a good outcome. So our ability to continue to invest in superiority, drive innovation, grow markets, and thereby build our share and improve our retailer's business is core to the business model of balanced growth. Balanced growth across the top-line with moderate margin expansion to drive the bottom line and cash productivity, is the only way forward for the industry and is the way forward for P&G. We will continue to be on this task even if in the short-term and mid-term, that means margin pressure will continue to rise. We would do everything possible within our P&L within the balance sheet to optimize for productivity. And we continue to have significant opportunities in productivity that do not impact our ability to run the business model. When you think about our marketing spend, we estimate there's still significant opportunity to optimize in the ability to reach consumers more broadly and more effectively at significantly lower cost as our digital reach increases. We have significant opportunities still in our supply chain to optimize, leverage the digitization we've been investing in in our supply chain over the past years, better synchronize demand from suppliers all the way to retail partners, and there's certainly still opportunities within our overhead structure where we can optimize work processes, leverage innovation, leverage automation to focus employees on higher order tasks. So, Jon, I'm sure you have a point of view here.\nJon Moeller: I might. Just a couple of pieces of perspective. First, this is a time to step forward, not back. Second, Andre in his repaired -- prepared remarks, articulated again the three priorities and the integrated set of strategies. Nowhere in there, at least to my ears, is pulling back on investment. The third and last piece of perspective I'd offer, the productivity muscle that we've built, ad Andre was just describing the opportunities that remain there which are significant, will or should build margin over time. If we look at the last 12 years, our operating margin on an all-in basis has increased 320 basis point from 20.4% to 23.6% last year. On a constant currency basis, that's an increase of a 1020 basis points. So the game here is stay on course, continue to drive productivity to fuel investment and superiority in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We do all of that over time. As Andre said, that is the recipe for balanced growth, growing the topline and the bottom line. We were in an environment where there will be volatility across quarters. That's not our concern. We're concerned about the execution of the holistic strategy and the value that, that creates over time.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Just following up on that, Jon. I know the enterprise markets have been an area of focus for you over the last couple of years. And my understanding is that as some of those enterprise markets go from either operating at a loss or break eve to becoming more profitable, that could serve as an incremental margin driver. Doesn't all have to be productivity, it can be mix as some of those lower-margin regions become more profitable. Can you give us an update on those enterprise markets? Have some swung to be less of a whatever -- hold back from a margin perspective and what's the outlook there? And then Andre, you talked so fast at the beginning. I didn't get the number for the growth and the enterprise markets. If you could give us that, again, that'd be great. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: If I reflect just back on last fiscal year with enterprise markets grew top line of 5%, build share grew bottom line ahead of the rest of the Company at 11%. We executed -- sorry. We exited the year with only one of those 80 plus markets losing money and that was Argentina, where we have a plan to address that overtime this Fiscal year. So we're on a very good position in enterprise markets. If we look at the quarter we just completed, focus markets grew 4%, enterprise markets grew 5%. Having said all of that, part of a responsible answer has to address the volatility that exists in these markets from a geopolitical standpoint and unfortunately from a health and COVID standpoint. So it's not a straight line in all likelihood from here to there but we're much, much better positioned and I'll give all the credit to the teams on the ground and these markets who are operating in very difficult, but as you rightly indicate, promising environments.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks for the feedback on the speed, Wendy. I will adjust.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in, and congrats on a decent start to the year. A couple of quick questions. First, can you expound more on what's happening in China, particularly on the beauty business? To think there are some references in the press release around mix and some slowing growth in Skin Care I suspect it's tethered to China. And secondly, more high level, it will be interesting how the earnings season plays out. But I'm guessing when we look back in the rear view mirror, you will have recorded one of the weakest price lines in the group and perhaps be the only one to not show sequential acceleration. And I guess my question is, why are we not seeing more? Is this a competitive strategy? And if so, how much your market share momentum would you attribute to your -- what seems to be an approach to dragging your feet on price? And should we be concerned that once you catch up, that some of these market share momentum could stall?\nAndre Schulten: Okay. There's a lot in there. So let me start with China. We continue to believe that China is a very attractive and important growth market for us. As we said, quarter 1 was flat in terms of organic sales growth, but on a two-year stack basis we are up 12%, which is ahead of the market. We would have expected some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to base period dynamics and also some continued effects of COVID shutdowns on a regional level. Overall, we feel well-positioned with our portfolio within China and expect the market to return to mid-single-digit growth going forward. Again, we take some comfort in that retail sales coming up to above 4% again in the past quarter. On beauty specifically, we've seen all strongest results in healthcare in fiscal '21, '22 in China with strong top-line growth and strong bottom-line growth. SK-II sales were flat in China for the quarter, but again, on a 13% increase last fiscal year. We see travel retail coming up in SK-II, so that also needs to be considered as we think about the total market of SK-II consumption. Certainly a slowdown in the market in the first quarter, and specifically, as you point out, on Skin Care and in the beauty sector. Overall, we feel still confident in our ability to win in the market and in the market's ability to sustain that single-digit market growth.\nJason English: Thank you. And on the price side, other dynamics?\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Sorry. On the pricing side, the reason why we're not seeing the pricing come through at this point in time is a couple of dynamics. Number 1, most of the pricing went into effect in September. So you only have less than a month really of pricing in the first quarter. We're also annualizing the base period where we had to lower promotion in the market as you recall. We are now seeing the normalization of commotion levels back to around 30% volumes sold on deal. So that's certainly offsetting some of the pricing that you otherwise would see flow through. I -- we certainly expect pricing to become a bigger part of the top-line and the bottom-line construct going forward as the pricing again materializes in the markets. And as we said before, we are not lagging pricing, we are driving pricing by category, ideally in line with innovation to ensure that we have the best possible value creation for consumers. We're executing SKU by SKU, market-by-market in what is right for that market in that particular scenario, and that's driving the pricing. And we expect pricing to be a net positive to the top-line and to the share position.\nOperator: And next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Based on some of the analysis that we've done, it looks like e-commerce in the U.S. continues to be very strong against pretty tough comps and that you guys are up well into double digits. Can you, number one, confirm that? Maybe give us a sense of what percentage of your business is e-commerce now, in the U.S. and globally. And then, going into it a little bit more. How do you see e-commerce driving your overall categories now? Is it driving premiumization? Are you continuing to gain or hold share in e-commerce? Just any thoughts and whether you're surprised that e-commerce has been so strong against such difficult comps. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: So e-commerce grows at a global level, continues to be very strong. We're up 16% in our e-comm business at a global level, that's a 66% two-year stack. Our e-comm business represents at this point in time about 14% of our total sales. And that's really across all e-comm channels. So it's not just pure plays. It's specifically in the U.S. is obviously pure play. But many of our omni partners, so when you think about target.com, walmart.com, etc, where you have fulfillment from store -- pick -up at store, play a significant role in that growth trajectory. The business in the U.S., specifically, we see about 11% growth in our e-com business. So again, continued strong momentum across all of these formats. We are well-positioned in e-comm for multiple reasons. As we explained before, we believe that a focus on strong brands as driven by COVID is benefiting us, specifically also in an e-com environment where we show up and search on the first page. And we are generally able to explain our benefits, our superiority, via more detailed e-content than we would be at a shelf for example. We have strong relationships with our partners as it comes to developing propositions and ensuring that our positions are fit for use in either e-comm channels or omni -channels. And when you think about an omni -environment, being the leading brand, generally results in more shelf space, more inventory on the shelf. So as consumers order, we can make sure that we are in-stock. That as we're being picked up, we have product on shelf and therefore can be found and can be fulfilled in-store. So generally, e-com, we believe, plays to our strengths and we can support our e-com business with strong marketing and brand building to sustain that level of growth.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up on Andre's comments on the anniversary of the promotional normalization. If I understood it correctly, you had 60 basis points headwind in gross margin in what you call product and packaging investment and also 90 basis points investment in marketing on SG&A line. So correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were saying you'll continue to invest to keep your superiority, of course, you're going to lean in and it's the time to lean in, But perhaps how should we be thinking on your ability to flex once pricing is implemented? A nd I'm assuming most of your competitors will follow or actually had lab before even. So how we should be thinking or investments going forward? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. As you've seen in this quarter, we continue to invest in line with our all-in growth. So our marketing spend, our ad spend is up a $130 million and that's what you should expect going forward. So as long as we can create a good return of investment with our incremental spend, we will continue to do so. At the same time, as I mentioned before, there's still significant opportunity to increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. So as we increase digital reach, as we are getting better at targeting, we can both increase reach and quality of reach and therefore offset some of that incremental investment by pure efficiency within the marketing spend. In terms of promotional dynamics, as I mentioned, we are -- the market is coming back up to more normal levels. Pre-COVID period promotion volumes were running at about 33%. Currently, we're back up about 30%. So we expect it to remain around that level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask one follow-up and one other question. So just on China, I thought you'd mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'd seen some of the weakness intra-quarter, I guess implying that it's gotten better so perhaps you could just talk about that dynamic as you exited the quarter there in terms of your total business's schedule, however you want to think about it. And then on the marketing investment, it's interesting that you continue to have efficiencies there to offset increased in investment. I guess the question is. how sustainable is that? And then are we to think that you take the efficiencies in invested all kind of backend marketing so that you remain fully funded or even increase off of current levels.\nAndre Schulten: On the first part of the question on China Beauty, we certainly saw some decrease in market size in the earlier part of the quarter. Sequentially, we see that recovering. We also expect, as I mentioned before, a return to mid-single digit growth across categories, so really not much more to add there. From a marketing efficiency standpoint, I think you'll see a combination of both. We -- as I said, I think we'll continue to drive efficiency as we bring more media spend into our optimized targeting pool as we increase the percentage of digital media around the world, as we continue to optimize our own algorithms to target messaging to consumers. There continues to be significant opportunity. And you'll see a combination of reinvestment in marketing programs and flowing those productivity effect into the P&L to offset some of the cost pressures. And it'll vary quarter-by-quarter depending on the situation.\nJon Moeller: And it might seem kind of an odd dynamic. But the more efficient and effective we can make our marketing spend be, and as Andre indicated just now, there's lots of opportunity to continue to do that, the more attractive it comes -- becomes to make those investments. So maybe what -- well, in somewhat of an odd way, efficiency breeds effectiveness, effectiveness breeds spending. And that all drives the market and the business.\nOperator: All right, the next question comes from the line of Camilo Garcia Walla with Credit Suisse.\nCamilo Garcia Walla: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I'd like to talk maybe a little bit more about the consumer condition. Obviously the market seem -- obviously your business has a lot of momentum, but it feels like the consumer is in a notably strong position at the moment. I'm curious if you agree with that, and if you do, what precisely, maybe that you're seeing is behind some of the strong demand? And then if I could layer on top of that question, we're just observing your numbers coming in better than expected, pricing is still yet to become a larger contributor, your comps are getting easier. Some of the conversations we've had this morning was -- is around why not bring up your organic revenue guidance for the year? So please add some color on that, would be helpful.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Okay. So I think the strength of consumption, our categories is really driven by the choice of categories that we operate in. We've chosen to be not in discretionary, but in daily use essential categories for the consumer. Again, health, hygiene focused and the clean home. The consumer continues to elevate the importance of these jobs coming out of COVID, as we've seen in COVID. And I think that continues to drive the importance of these categories and our ability to win in these categories because consumers return or turn to trusted brands because they know that they can deliver on the promise and the job to be done. We see that in our share results. And as Jon mentioned, we see it in the reverse share results of private label, for example, declining both in the U.S. and Europe overtime. We also benefit, and the consumer spending shows it, from more time at home, which we believe is an ongoing phenomena. More time at home means more meals at home, more dishwashing at home, more laundry at home. And again, those elements benefit our brands and our categories in terms of growth. We will continue to focus on superiority, as we said before, to ensure that we have the strongest solutions for our consumers at any price point, at any price ladder. But really, we benefit, I think, from overall more time at home and an elevated focus on all categories. On the organic price mix and guidance, you're right and we're expecting pricing to become a bigger part of the top line construct, as we said, throughout the year. We are one quarter in. There's a lot of volatility in the market and so we believe that it's prudent to maintain the guidance range of 2% to 4% on the top-line. But as we said in our prepared remarks, Quarter 1 results give us confidence to the upper half of that guidance range.\nJon Moeller: I would just make one additional comment which relates to the consumer and their behavior in these categories. Again, daily use where performance drives brand choice, often providing a health, hygiene or clean home benefit. And let me just give you an example of what's possible. One of our more recent innovations in Oral Care, for example, the iO power brush premium priced product. we have -- since the introduction of that about a year ago, we've built over 2 points of share, which has come by driving the market. The market is up 14%, over that period of time we've driven over 50% of that. So what you see is a consumer who is responsive to performance-based innovation. We can utilize that responsiveness to grow markets in a constructive way, which as Andre has mentioned many times, is beneficial to our retail partners and is constructive from market dynamics standpoint. So there are many categories where through performance-based innovation, we can provide more delight through regimen solutions. We can provide more delight -- the consumer generally is responsive to performance in these categories. And consumption is expandable.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much. Just to confirm an answer to the prior question in a category specific question. Just around the organic sales guidance for the year, you've made some statements just around material supply, supply chain constraints, how much of that is factored into how you're thinking about the full-year organic sales outlook? And then just from a category's perspective, Fabric Care has been a good story. Loans were particularly strong again on difficult comp. Just in general, what do you think is driving the share gains that you've seeing in the category? We've heard about some material constraints for some of your competitors. Do you think that's a factor? Is it just more about innovation? Just in general, do you have some perspective on what you think is driving this particularly strong delivery on the Fabric Care side of the business. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah, thank you. On organic sales guidance, as we said, I think the supply chain pressures that we see today and our ability to deal with those pressures, as we have been over the past 18 to 24 months, is anticipated to continue in the organic sales guidance that we've given. And any unforeseen major disruptions, obviously, we will have to reassess and see where we are. But we feel good about our ability to deal with the ongoing supply chain pressures, and that's reflected in the organic sales guidance. Look, I think the story behind Fabric Care is really bringing to live the strategy. This is a category where performance drives brand choice, where daily use is essential to the consumer and performance is very visible. And the category has done a phenomenal job in driving superiority with new forms, or by creating new jobs to be done that are relevant for the consumer. If you think about single unit dose, for example, very superior proposition, very insightful in -- very intuitive to the consumer in terms of use. A premiumization of the category in trading up dollars per wash with superior cleaning properties. And penetration outside of the U.S. still is a significant growth opportunity. In Germany and Canada, we're only at 20% wholesale penetration on single unit bills and in Japan, we're only at 11%. So there continues to be significant runway with a truly superior product form. We also, in Fabric Care, have done -- the team has done a phenomenal job in looking into fast-growing new segments. When you think about fabric enhancers, 14% growth in the quarter. Bits for example, right now is a billion-dollar brand and continues to grow significantly. Wholesale penetration in the U.S. on bits only 20%, low penetration only about 30%. There continues to be significant runway with superior innovation and superior products. We continue to drive that and that's what you see in the results.\nOperator: All right. And your final question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning everyone. I would love to just get your view on what you're seeing in emerging markets around the world, particularly in Latin America. Have you seen any changes in terms of category growth or the health of the broader consumer in that region? And I know you previously discussed a prolonged recovery and a number of these markets. Is that still the right thinking as we look out to the balance of the year? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Latin America, I'll speak to that just because it's a business I've been supporting over the last period of time here, overall continues to deliver very solid growth. And that's broad based. In the last quarter, Mexico up, I think about 8%. Argentina -- sorry, Brazil up double-digits. And now, Latin America comes with its inherent challenges. And one of those currently is a -- is the health challenge that exists in many markets which you I'm sure are familiar with. But generally, consumption is strong and our business is very strong in Latin America.\nPeter Grom: All right.\nJon Moeller: Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: I think that concludes the call. Again, thank you for joining us. And again, if you have any questions, John Chevalier or I are available all day. So if you want to give us a call, please feel free to. And thanks again for joining us for our quarter one call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Let me just build on Andre's comments with a couple big picture thoughts. Given the inflationary cycle that we're in, how do you want to be positioned? You want to have -- first of all, being in categories that are daily use that are focused -- where performance drives brand choice is a good place to be. Consumers through the pandemic have shifted their consumption in those categories towards trusted performing brands. And you see that even in what's happening with private label market shares, as an example, down in the U.S. over the past 3 months, down in Europe over the same periods of time. None of that is a guarantee for the future but you start in a very good position with a strong superiority profile as Andre has said, and a strong innovation program and investment program to continue that work. Number 2, you want to be dependable. And just one more thing to add to number 1, this is essentially part and parcel of our business model. Sometimes the reaction is -- this -- with this pricing is a new dynamic. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line for 44 out of 47 for the last quarters, and 16 of the last 17 years. Again, no guarantee for the future but we start with a business model that fundamentally supports pricing in a way that is value accretive to consumers. Second, you want to be in a position to minimize the need for pricing through productivity. We're in a better position on that regard than we've ever been. This organization has done a tremendous job, reducing costs and we'll continue to do so. We want to be in a position where you have product available at different price points to appeal to consumers for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. We're in much better position there than we were in the last cycle. So again, none of that is any guarantee for the future, but all of that positions us much better than we've been historically. One other dynamic that feeds into this is the confidence of our suppliers in our business, both in terms of our business momentum. So if they need to make investments to increase their capacity and material availability, the momentum of our business factors directly into that decision. Second and related, the increments of capacity that we can offtake to generate economics at the supplier level that make investments viable. If we were just adding to demand on the margin, it would be a very different equation. So we become a very attractive customer for our suppliers because of both the size and importantly, the momentum of our business. I might. Just a couple of pieces of perspective. First, this is a time to step forward, not back. Second, Andre in his repaired -- prepared remarks, articulated again the three priorities and the integrated set of strategies. Nowhere in there, at least to my ears, is pulling back on investment. The third and last piece of perspective I'd offer, the productivity muscle that we've built, ad Andre was just describing the opportunities that remain there which are significant, will or should build margin over time. If we look at the last 12 years, our operating margin on an all-in basis has increased 320 basis point from 20.4% to 23.6% last year. On a constant currency basis, that's an increase of a 1020 basis points. So the game here is stay on course, continue to drive productivity to fuel investment and superiority in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We do all of that over time. As Andre said, that is the recipe for balanced growth, growing the topline and the bottom line. We were in an environment where there will be volatility across quarters. That's not our concern. We're concerned about the execution of the holistic strategy and the value that, that creates over time. If I reflect just back on last fiscal year with enterprise markets grew top line of 5%, build share grew bottom line ahead of the rest of the Company at 11%. We executed -- sorry. We exited the year with only one of those 80 plus markets losing money and that was Argentina, where we have a plan to address that overtime this Fiscal year. So we're on a very good position in enterprise markets. If we look at the quarter we just completed, focus markets grew 4%, enterprise markets grew 5%. Having said all of that, part of a responsible answer has to address the volatility that exists in these markets from a geopolitical standpoint and unfortunately from a health and COVID standpoint. So it's not a straight line in all likelihood from here to there but we're much, much better positioned and I'll give all the credit to the teams on the ground and these markets who are operating in very difficult, but as you rightly indicate, promising environments. And it might seem kind of an odd dynamic. But the more efficient and effective we can make our marketing spend be, and as Andre indicated just now, there's lots of opportunity to continue to do that, the more attractive it comes -- becomes to make those investments. So maybe what -- well, in somewhat of an odd way, efficiency breeds effectiveness, effectiveness breeds spending. And that all drives the market and the business. I would just make one additional comment which relates to the consumer and their behavior in these categories. Again, daily use where performance drives brand choice, often providing a health, hygiene or clean home benefit. And let me just give you an example of what's possible. One of our more recent innovations in Oral Care, for example, the iO power brush premium priced product. we have -- since the introduction of that about a year ago, we've built over 2 points of share, which has come by driving the market.

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, currently Vice Chair and incoming President and Chief Executive Officer as of November 1st; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. The July to September quarter provides a good start to the fiscal year, putting us on track to deliver our guidance for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash return to share owners. We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top line growth and strong cost savings kept EPS growth nearly in line with prior year. Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up. So moving to first quarter results, organic sales grew 4%, volume contributed 2 points of sales growth, pricing, and mix each added 1 point. Growth was broad-based across business units with nine out of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Healthcare, up double digits; Fabric Care grew high singles; Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming, up mid singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care, and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low single digits. Family Care declined mid singles, comping very strong growth in the base period. Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S., despite 16% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 20%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year due to strong growth in the base period comp and due to intra-quarter softness and beauty market growth. On a two-year stack basis, organic China organic sales are up 12% in line to slightly ahead of underlying market growth. Focused markets grew 4% for the quarter and enterprise markets were up 5%. E-commerce sales grew 16% versus prior year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in term share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew mid-single digits this quarter and P&G value share continued to grow to over 34%. We are up more than a 1.5 versus first quarter last year. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based; 9 of 10 product categories grew share over the past three months with the 10th improving to flat versus year-ago over the past one month. Consumers are continuing to prefer P&G brands. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.61, down 1% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS declined 3%, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs, which we highlighted in our initial outlook for the year. Core gross margin decreased 370 basis points and currency neutral core gross margin was down 390 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were 400 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was an 80 basis points headwind, primarily due to geographic impacts. Productivity, savings, pricing, and foreign exchange provided a partial offset to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&A, marketing expense as a percentage of sales was in line with prior year level for the quarter, increasing more than 5% in absolute dollars consistent with all-in sales growth. Core operating margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core operating margin declined 270 basis points. Productivity improvements were 180 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. We returned nearly $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2.2 billion in dividends and approximately $2.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, in the context of a very challenging cost environment, good results across top line, bottom line, and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into these challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies, and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily used products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth. In our categories, this drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment, and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin extension, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business; no area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and to create new trends of technology that will shape the industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies, they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales, and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis and have served us well during the volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategy framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving onto guidance. We will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through this fiscal year. As we saw this quarter, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with the realities of currency and cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Supply chains are under pressure from tight labor markets, tight transportation markets, and overall capacity constraints. Inflationary pressures are broad-based and sustained. Foreign exchange rates add more volatility to this mix. We have also experienced some short-term disruptions in materials availability in several regions around the world. Our purchasing R&D and logistics experts have done a great job managing these challenges. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made, and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Input costs have continued to rise since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.1 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Fiscal costs have -- freight costs have also continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of this higher cost with price increases and with productivity savings. As discussed last quarter and in the more recent investor conferences, we've announced price increases in the U.S. on portions of our Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, and Fabric Care businesses. In the last few weeks, we've also announced to retailers in the U.S. that we will increase prices on segments of our Grooming, Skin Care, and Oral Care businesses. The degree of timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand, and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impact. As always, we will look to close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. As we've said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. I will go First Quarter results confirm our guidance ranges for the Fiscal year across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Our solid start to the Fiscal year increases our confidence in the upper half of this range. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reach store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. While it's still early in the pricing cycle, we haven't seen notable changes in consumer behavior. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%, despite the increased cost challenges we're facing. Foreign exchange is now expected to be neutral to after-tax earnings compared to the modest tailwind we estimated at the start of the year. Considering FX was a modest help to first quarter earnings, we're projecting it to be a headwind for the balance of the year. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight, and foreign exchange is now a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for Fiscal '22 earnings, or roughly $0.90 per share, a 16% point headwind to core EPS growth. This is $500 million after-tax of incremental cost pressure versus our initial outlook for the year. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands. So while we are not changing our core EPS guidance range, please take note of these dynamics as you update your outlook for the year. Will face the most significant cost impacts in the first half of the Fiscal year as pricing goes into effect, as savings programs ramp up, and as we begin to annualize the initial spike and input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the year. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock. Combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities on ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products, and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. Will continue to step forward toward our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. Thank you, Steve. I'll start by saying that overall consumption trends remain strong globally, particularly as you said in the U.S. Markets continue to grow within our categories of daily use, health and hygiene in the range of mid singles. So from a consumption standpoint, consumer behavior continues to elevate the importance of health hygiene and a clean home. More time at home certainly is also a factor. We continue to see elevated consumption on bounty paper towels, for example, by 10%. Charmin bath tissue is still elevated, consuming about 5% with more time at home. So overall consumption trends remained strong and fuel most of the growth. We also have been able to grow share as we've outlined in our prepared remarks. Also, on a global basis, we're up 50 basis points over the past three months and 70 basis points over the past six months. So that's certainly contributing to a stronger position to benefit from that growth. In the U.S., we've reached record share of 34.4% of value share up more than a point. Inventory effects, I would tell you, certainly play a role in some geographies. Mainly in China, we saw some inventory build in the base period, which the reverse is obviously happening in this period. But in the grand scheme of things, they don't really impact our consumption trends and our shipment trends in the quarter. Thanks, Kevin. So maybe let me start with the current outlook for commodities. The increases that we are seeing are broad-based across commodity classes. Our forecast is based on spot rates. We are assuming that the spot rates sustain. So all of our productivity programs, all of our pricing programs, all of our innovation programs are based on the assumption that current spot rates, as reflected in the current guidance, will sustain. We do not hedge commodities per se, so the position that you see here is the position as it impacts our P&L. We offset within our natural hedging position within foreign exchange rate, commodity basket and interest rates. That's the best way for us to protect against volatility and the most cost-effective way to protect against volatility. In terms of supply chain dynamics, certainly demand and supply have not balanced globally as we can see. We continue to see pressure on transportation and warehousing. We continue to see driver shortages, diesel increases. And as I mentioned before, across our commodity classes whether it's chemicals, resins, packaging, or pulp, these increases that we've seen as reflected in the current guidance reflects the existing market dynamics. So the best forecast we have is current spot, and that's what we're going to continue to operate against. We will -- as we articulated, I think before and want to reemphasize in this call as well, we will recover these costs over time. We will not sacrifice investment in the business as we do so. So strong productivity programs that are ramping up throughout the fiscal year. Pricing with innovation that we are bringing into the market if we can to improve value at the same time as we take pricing, All straight commodity pricing throughout the year will ease the margin pressures over time. But it will take time to recover the costs and we will intentionally take our time to recover the cost to protect investment in our superiority strategy, which is working well to drive our top line growth and overall balanced growth model. Yeah. Look, we're taking pricing around the globe and it's really a decision that has taken market-by-market, category-by-category and many cases SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market. So broad-based statements are difficult, so let me try to maybe focus on the U.S. here as a good example, and all biggest market. We have now announced pricing in nine out of 10 categories, so very broad-based. Many of these price increases are being implemented -- have been implemented in September or are being implemented over the next, call it, 90 days. You've seen the price increases. We've announced across Baby, Feminine Care, Family Care, they are mid singles. I would expect, even though the price increases on Grooming, Skin Care have just been out and they are different by few -- about the same range. Mid-singles is about the range that I would expect, again, out on the majority of our portfolio at this point. I cannot comment on future price increases, but we'll continue to evolve as the situation evolves in terms of cost and in terms of ability to take more pricing. In terms of recovery of cost, we expect, as we said in our prepared remarks, that the margin situation and the comp situation on core EPS was sequentially improved throughout the fiscal year. We will annualize part of the commodity cost increase starting with Q3. Most of the pricing will also take effect and actually flow through to the bottom line as of Q3. And our productivity programs will significantly ramp up throughout the fiscal year. All of that said, hard to predict exactly what we're going to lend about sequential progress. It's certainly what we are striving for. Most important point, as I said before, we will not reduce investment in the business. We continue to drive marketing spend, we continue to drive investment and superiority to sustain our balanced growth strategy for the mid and long term. Very early to read anything in terms of price elasticity. I will tell you for those price increases that have gone into the market in the U.S., most of them became effective middle of September and we have not seen any material reaction from consumers in terms of volume offtake. So that makes us feel good about our relative position. And obviously, we feel that we should be in a favorable position given the strength of our portfolio. We're going into this pricing round with 75% of our portfolio truly superior. Probably 80% by the time multi-piece pricing thesis hit. And that should give us a relatively strong position with consumers to deliver value in their mind even as we take pricing. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. We are certainly not immune to the stress that is put on the supply chains globally. And we are very thankful to our supply chain teams who have done a tremendous job in developing business continuity plans and executing against those business continuity plans over the past 18 months, 24 months, as supply-chains were stressed throughout the COVID pandemic. The strength of our supply chains is mainly driven by the flexibility that we can create within those supply chains. So strong supplier partnerships around the globe allow us to shift sourcing if we need to from one supplier to another either because of supply not being available or freight lanes not being available to get materials from point A to B. It also allows us to optimize costs to a degree. And we've been doing that over the past few months and we'll continue to do so. We have an ability to reformulate some of our products which we're doing actively without impacting the superiority of the product or any noticeable impact to the consumer. And that gives us flexibility to adjust again to material availability or cost. We also have an organization that looks around the corner, anticipates potential bottlenecks, and then chooses to build inventory. It's either on materials and intermediates or unfinished products to then be able to withdraw from those inventories on a global basis. So it doesn't mean that we build inventory in the same region where we consume, but we have the ability to do that on a global basis. So in that sense, the global footprint is an advantage to us. As I said, we're not immune to any impact here. But if history is any indication of the future, we feel relatively well-positioned because of the strength of our organization here. Of course, if there are any major disruptions to supply chains, we would be exposed just like everyone else. In terms of energy availability, we'll acknowledge that we've obviously been part of some of those curtailments that we've seen in China, for example. But they've not had a material effect of our supply chains. Again, when you think about our ability to potentially source from other regions for a period of time, most of our factories are able to run formula carts and run products for other regions, which gives us flexibility on our footprint to overcome short-term challenges. Thanks, Nik. On the materials question, look I think the -- both the run-up and cost is very broad-based across all material classes, and that's the indication of demand to supply situation. It's really different week-by-week. I wouldn't point to any specific material that is structurally more exposed than another. It is really is across the input basket. And again, the dynamics I was describing within all supply chain is how we're dealing with it. And the change is really period by period. On the overall costs trade-off versus strategy. I will start and then I'm sure Jon has a lot to add here. I would say that sticking to our strategy is core and the commitment is relentless. We have over many periods tried to do it in a different way and that is not a good outcome. So our ability to continue to invest in superiority, drive innovation, grow markets, and thereby build our share and improve our retailer's business is core to the business model of balanced growth. Balanced growth across the top-line with moderate margin expansion to drive the bottom line and cash productivity, is the only way forward for the industry and is the way forward for P&G. We will continue to be on this task even if in the short-term and mid-term, that means margin pressure will continue to rise. We would do everything possible within our P&L within the balance sheet to optimize for productivity. And we continue to have significant opportunities in productivity that do not impact our ability to run the business model. When you think about our marketing spend, we estimate there's still significant opportunity to optimize in the ability to reach consumers more broadly and more effectively at significantly lower cost as our digital reach increases. We have significant opportunities still in our supply chain to optimize, leverage the digitization we've been investing in in our supply chain over the past years, better synchronize demand from suppliers all the way to retail partners, and there's certainly still opportunities within our overhead structure where we can optimize work processes, leverage innovation, leverage automation to focus employees on higher order tasks. So, Jon, I'm sure you have a point of view here. Thanks for the feedback on the speed, Wendy. I will adjust. Okay. There's a lot in there. So let me start with China. We continue to believe that China is a very attractive and important growth market for us. As we said, quarter 1 was flat in terms of organic sales growth, but on a two-year stack basis we are up 12%, which is ahead of the market. We would have expected some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to base period dynamics and also some continued effects of COVID shutdowns on a regional level. Overall, we feel well-positioned with our portfolio within China and expect the market to return to mid-single-digit growth going forward. Again, we take some comfort in that retail sales coming up to above 4% again in the past quarter. On beauty specifically, we've seen all strongest results in healthcare in fiscal '21, '22 in China with strong top-line growth and strong bottom-line growth. SK-II sales were flat in China for the quarter, but again, on a 13% increase last fiscal year. We see travel retail coming up in SK-II, so that also needs to be considered as we think about the total market of SK-II consumption. Certainly a slowdown in the market in the first quarter, and specifically, as you point out, on Skin Care and in the beauty sector. Overall, we feel still confident in our ability to win in the market and in the market's ability to sustain that single-digit market growth. Yeah. Sorry. On the pricing side, the reason why we're not seeing the pricing come through at this point in time is a couple of dynamics. Number 1, most of the pricing went into effect in September. So you only have less than a month really of pricing in the first quarter. We're also annualizing the base period where we had to lower promotion in the market as you recall. We are now seeing the normalization of commotion levels back to around 30% volumes sold on deal. So that's certainly offsetting some of the pricing that you otherwise would see flow through. I -- we certainly expect pricing to become a bigger part of the top-line and the bottom-line construct going forward as the pricing again materializes in the markets. And as we said before, we are not lagging pricing, we are driving pricing by category, ideally in line with innovation to ensure that we have the best possible value creation for consumers. We're executing SKU by SKU, market-by-market in what is right for that market in that particular scenario, and that's driving the pricing. And we expect pricing to be a net positive to the top-line and to the share position. So e-commerce grows at a global level, continues to be very strong. We're up 16% in our e-comm business at a global level, that's a 66% two-year stack. Our e-comm business represents at this point in time about 14% of our total sales. And that's really across all e-comm channels. So it's not just pure plays. It's specifically in the U.S. is obviously pure play. But many of our omni partners, so when you think about target.com, walmart.com, etc, where you have fulfillment from store -- pick -up at store, play a significant role in that growth trajectory. The business in the U.S., specifically, we see about 11% growth in our e-com business. So again, continued strong momentum across all of these formats. We are well-positioned in e-comm for multiple reasons. As we explained before, we believe that a focus on strong brands as driven by COVID is benefiting us, specifically also in an e-com environment where we show up and search on the first page. And we are generally able to explain our benefits, our superiority, via more detailed e-content than we would be at a shelf for example. We have strong relationships with our partners as it comes to developing propositions and ensuring that our positions are fit for use in either e-comm channels or omni -channels. And when you think about an omni -environment, being the leading brand, generally results in more shelf space, more inventory on the shelf. So as consumers order, we can make sure that we are in-stock. That as we're being picked up, we have product on shelf and therefore can be found and can be fulfilled in-store. So generally, e-com, we believe, plays to our strengths and we can support our e-com business with strong marketing and brand building to sustain that level of growth. Yeah. As you've seen in this quarter, we continue to invest in line with our all-in growth. So our marketing spend, our ad spend is up a $130 million and that's what you should expect going forward. So as long as we can create a good return of investment with our incremental spend, we will continue to do so. At the same time, as I mentioned before, there's still significant opportunity to increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. So as we increase digital reach, as we are getting better at targeting, we can both increase reach and quality of reach and therefore offset some of that incremental investment by pure efficiency within the marketing spend. In terms of promotional dynamics, as I mentioned, we are -- the market is coming back up to more normal levels. Pre-COVID period promotion volumes were running at about 33%. Currently, we're back up about 30%. So we expect it to remain around that level. On the first part of the question on China Beauty, we certainly saw some decrease in market size in the earlier part of the quarter. Sequentially, we see that recovering. We also expect, as I mentioned before, a return to mid-single digit growth across categories, so really not much more to add there. From a marketing efficiency standpoint, I think you'll see a combination of both. We -- as I said, I think we'll continue to drive efficiency as we bring more media spend into our optimized targeting pool as we increase the percentage of digital media around the world, as we continue to optimize our own algorithms to target messaging to consumers. There continues to be significant opportunity. And you'll see a combination of reinvestment in marketing programs and flowing those productivity effect into the P&L to offset some of the cost pressures. And it'll vary quarter-by-quarter depending on the situation. Yeah. Okay. So I think the strength of consumption, our categories is really driven by the choice of categories that we operate in. We've chosen to be not in discretionary, but in daily use essential categories for the consumer. Again, health, hygiene focused and the clean home. The consumer continues to elevate the importance of these jobs coming out of COVID, as we've seen in COVID. And I think that continues to drive the importance of these categories and our ability to win in these categories because consumers return or turn to trusted brands because they know that they can deliver on the promise and the job to be done. We see that in our share results. And as Jon mentioned, we see it in the reverse share results of private label, for example, declining both in the U.S. and Europe overtime. We also benefit, and the consumer spending shows it, from more time at home, which we believe is an ongoing phenomena. More time at home means more meals at home, more dishwashing at home, more laundry at home. And again, those elements benefit our brands and our categories in terms of growth. We will continue to focus on superiority, as we said before, to ensure that we have the strongest solutions for our consumers at any price point, at any price ladder. But really, we benefit, I think, from overall more time at home and an elevated focus on all categories. On the organic price mix and guidance, you're right and we're expecting pricing to become a bigger part of the top line construct, as we said, throughout the year. We are one quarter in. There's a lot of volatility in the market and so we believe that it's prudent to maintain the guidance range of 2% to 4% on the top-line. But as we said in our prepared remarks, Quarter 1 results give us confidence to the upper half of that guidance range. Yeah, thank you. On organic sales guidance, as we said, I think the supply chain pressures that we see today and our ability to deal with those pressures, as we have been over the past 18 to 24 months, is anticipated to continue in the organic sales guidance that we've given. And any unforeseen major disruptions, obviously, we will have to reassess and see where we are. But we feel good about our ability to deal with the ongoing supply chain pressures, and that's reflected in the organic sales guidance. Look, I think the story behind Fabric Care is really bringing to live the strategy. This is a category where performance drives brand choice, where daily use is essential to the consumer and performance is very visible. And the category has done a phenomenal job in driving superiority with new forms, or by creating new jobs to be done that are relevant for the consumer. If you think about single unit dose, for example, very superior proposition, very insightful in -- very intuitive to the consumer in terms of use. A premiumization of the category in trading up dollars per wash with superior cleaning properties. And penetration outside of the U.S. still is a significant growth opportunity. In Germany and Canada, we're only at 20% wholesale penetration on single unit bills and in Japan, we're only at 11%. So there continues to be significant runway with a truly superior product form. We also, in Fabric Care, have done -- the team has done a phenomenal job in looking into fast-growing new segments. When you think about fabric enhancers, 14% growth in the quarter. Bits for example, right now is a billion-dollar brand and continues to grow significantly. Wholesale penetration in the U.S. on bits only 20%, low penetration only about 30%. There continues to be significant runway with superior innovation and superior products. We continue to drive that and that's what you see in the results. I think that concludes the call. Again, thank you for joining us. And again, if you have any questions, John Chevalier or I are available all day. So if you want to give us a call, please feel free to. And thanks again for joining us for our quarter one call. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s quarter end conference call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.  As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: With me today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I\u2019ll start with an overview of results for fiscal year \u201923 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal \u201924 and then take your questions. Fiscal \u201923 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategy continues to yield broad-based strong sales growth across categories and regions, strong earnings in the face of significant cost headwinds, and continued strong return on cash to P&G shareholders.  Organic sales for the fiscal year grew 7%, our second consecutive year of 7% organic sales growth and fifth consecutive year of 5% or better organic growth starting fiscal 2019 - 5%, 6%, 6%, 7% and 7%. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal healthcare grew mid-teens, feminine care grew double digits, fabric care, home care and hair care up high single digits, skin and personal care, baby care, family care and grooming each grew mid singles. Oral care grew low single digits. Focus markets were up 5% for the year and we delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 6% on top of a strong 8% growth comp in the base period. Greater China organic sales were down low single digits versus the prior year, with trends improving in the back half as the market continues to slowly recover. Enterprise markets were up 15% led by Latin America with 24% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 7%, now representing 17% of total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth is in turn driving share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 7% in fiscal \u201923. P&G consumption grew ahead of fair share of category growth, driving modest value share growth and volume share up 50 basis points for the year. We held global aggregate market share. Twenty-nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Seven of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $5.90, up 2% for the year despite a 24 percentage point earnings growth headwind, or $1.38 from share from higher material costs and foreign exchange. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS was up 11%.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We increased our dividend by 3% and returned over $16 billion of value to share owners, $9 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase.  Moving to the April to June quarter, organic sales grew 8%. We have now delivered seven consecutive quarters with 5% or better organic sales growth. Pricing contributed seven points to organic sales growth, mix was up 2 points, volume declined one point, improving sequentially versus the March quarter, as expected. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Skin and personal care, personal healthcare, home care, feminine care, and family care, five of our 10 categories, each grew double digits. Baby care, hair care and grooming grew high singles, fabric care grew mid singles, and oral care was up low single digits.  Each of our seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 7% and enterprise markets up 13% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%. Importantly, this includes 3 points of volume growth, a return to positive volume in our largest market for the first time in five quarters. Greater China organic sales grew 4%. We continue to see sequential market recovery, but as expected at a slow pace. European focused market organic sales were up 12% despite volume pressure from wider pricing gaps. In enterprise markets, Latin America led the growth with organic sales up 22%.  Global aggregate market share increased 10 basis points. Twenty nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the quarter.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 22%.  Core operating margin increased 190 basis points as benefits from strong sales growth and productivity improvements more than offset higher material cost, foreign exchange headwinds, wage and benefit inflation, and reinvestment in higher media reach and frequency. Currency neutral operating margin increased 310 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 136%. We returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to share owners in the quarter.  In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year: organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash returned to share owners, strong performance again this year in a very difficult operating environment.  Now I\u2019ll pass it over to Jon.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Andre. I want to talk briefly about this company, its strategy and our organization both as a step-back reflection on what\u2019s been accomplished and as a glimpse forward to what\u2019s possible.  Three quick reflections looking back: first, pre-COVID, during COVID and since COVID, pre-inflation and since inflation, consistent strong top line growth across categories and geographies, core earnings for share growth for each of the last five fiscal years, consistent cash return to share owners. Our strategy has sustained us through all of this.  Second look back, in the past two years, nearly half of our earnings wiped out by commodities, transportation and foreign exchange headwinds, yet we still grew earnings per share in each of those years while delivering 7% organic sales growth each year, increasing investment in innovation, brand building and growing markets, and growing market share in aggregate in the process.  As I said last quarter, if you told me four years ago that we would grow top line and bottom line and deliver strong cash return to share owners through a global pandemic with employees challenged to get to the workplace, in the context of a war in Europe, major disruption in global supply chains, rapidly escalating costs, the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, and fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and channel relevance, it would have been hard to agree, but that\u2019s exactly what this team has done. Over the last five years, they\u2019ve added over $15 billion in incremental sales, grown our share of the global market, grown core earnings per share by 40%, and returned over $80 billion of cash to share owners.  Two more granular examples testing both strategy and execution in some of the harshest conditions, Latin America - significant devaluation across all major currencies, inflation in Brazil peaking at above 12%, 9% in Mexico, over 70% in Argentina. Despite this, our team has delivered three consecutive years of U.S. dollar sales growth, mid teens in fiscal \u201922 and mid 20s this year. Market share growth on both a volume and value basis, nearly 30% profit growth this year in dollars, over 50% on a local currency basis.  One more test - Turkey, over the past two years, the lira has devalued more than 300%. We had to take multiple ways of significant pricing; still, the strength of our strategy and its execution by the organization has enabled us to grow dollar sales, grow volume, sequentially improve market share, and maintain dollar profitability in the market. As you well know, past performance is no guarantee of future results and certainly no excuse to stand still - quite the opposite. There will be bumps in the road ahead. We\u2019re still navigating through plenty of challenges right now. Each of these look backs, though, gives us confidence in the effectiveness of the strategy grounded in and focused on consumers and an appreciation for the capabilities of our talented, creative, agile and committed organization.  Our integrated strategy, a focused portfolio of products in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. Superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with our retail partners. Productivity to offset cost challenges while funding investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth. We\u2019re re-accelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste. Constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry to adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that often extend our competitive advantage, and an organization structure that\u2019s increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable, an increasingly diverse organization now with 50% female representation in manager roles across the world. We\u2019re strengthening the execution of our strategy in four focus areas. First with supply chain 3.0, we\u2019re driving improved capacity, greater agility, flexibility, scalability, transparency and resilience, along with greater productivity. We recently launched a platform of supply chain services to enable best-in-class service and streamline the end-to-end supply chain. These initiatives have been very well received by retailers.  Our next step to drive joint value creation with retailers is to simplify our SKU portfolio, to improve the shopping experience, increase on-shelf availability and further streamline supply for the entire ecosystem, higher quality, more transparency, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products. Each improves superiority with consumers and improves what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retain partners and third party industry surveys. All of this is a huge value creation opportunity for P&G and our retail partners. Next focus area, environmental sustainability, to create superior propositions for consumers, customers and shareholders while improving our environmental impact. Reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges.  Third, digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value; and fourth, a superior employee value equation for all genders, identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. We stand by people and support them in small but meaningful ways every day with superior performing products at a superior value. We strive to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G\u2019s values and principles. This approach with consumers at the center and an organization built to serve them has served us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, society will benefit, and shareholders will continue to be rewarded for their investment, not measured by a quarter or even a year but over time. I believe in this company, in our organization, it\u2019s capabilities and in the commitment of P&G people to serve consumers. I\u2019m excited about what lays ahead. Of course, I have my worries and concerns and we\u2019ll continue to face challenges and some dark days and nights, but the future in general holds great promise. We\u2019ll continue to be guided by our purpose, values and principles and relentless execution of our strategy to move forward to an ever-brighter dawn. P&G celebrates its 186th anniversary this year. I believe we have an even stronger hand to play today than we\u2019ve had historically. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year.\nAndre Schulten: Thank you Jon. As we\u2019ve said in each guidance outlook for the past three years and as Jon indicated, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead, and while supply chains and input costs have become more stable as we enter fiscal \u201924, the challenges we face are multi-faceted: economic, geopolitical, and societal, putting pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets. We\u2019ll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers with every step. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal \u201924. Foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind and, based on current rates, we now expect a $400 million after-tax impact. We still face above normal levels of wage and benefit cost inflation in our cost structure and higher costs for third party services. In addition, we expect below-the-line impact from higher net interest expense to be a roughly $200 million after tax earnings headwind. With this context, I\u2019ll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 4%, with the drivers of market growth normalizing as we move through the year, pricing becoming less of a driver and volume returning to modest growth. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for fiscal \u201924.  On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% versus fiscal year \u201923 EPS of $5.90. This guidance equates to a range of $6.25 to $6.43 per share, $6.34 or up 7.5% at the center of the range. With a three-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 9% to 12% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories.  We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year.  Top line, bottom line and cash guidance for fiscal \u201924 all consistent with our long term algorithm. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, more store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. These guidance ranges also do not assume a further reduction in commodity and material costs versus current levels. If this should occur, it would generate greater flexibility to invest more in value-accretive innovation and marketing opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts.\nJon Moeller: We\u2019re very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging operating cost and competitive environment over the last five years. Excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners  With that, Andre and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks Operator. Good morning everyone.  My question is revenue rebalancing is a real focusing for retailers, and I guess for you all as well as we kind of look into \u201924. Can you provide some color on how Procter approached this in its \u201924 operating plan, maybe comment on--I know we\u2019re getting questions, comment maybe on level of investment up or down, the mix between spending at the top of the P&L versus the middle of the P&L, and maybe if there are any segments or geographies that require more intention than others. It\u2019s a big issue, and just really want to get some color in terms of how you all approached it as you went into \u201924. \nAndre Schulten: Yes, good morning Bryan. I\u2019ll start. Look, our strategy is to grow categories, and that is the same strategy we\u2019ll execute in fiscal \u201924, and that means growing categories across volume and value. I think we take great comfort in the U.S. results, where we already see volume growth in quarter four of 3%, which is half of the growth we saw in the quarter of 6% in terms of sales.  Driving volume and value category growth, in our mind, is best done via innovation and by driving superiority across the five vectors that we have defined: product, package, communication, go-to-market, and value, and we see plenty of opportunity across our categories to drive household penetration, drive usage occasions, drive new jobs to be done with all physical and mental levers that are available to us, so we\u2019ll continue to invest in that direction.  We have plenty of innovation that is doing just that. Just to give you a few examples, if you look at China, Safeguard China is the number one PCC brand and Detox body wash, which is two times the market average price, has almost doubled in fiscal \u201923 and will continue to build on that strength by driving better awareness and even more awareness on that brand. In Europe, Ariel four-chamber unit dose and the ECOCLIC packaging, very strong results contributed to more than 20% sales growth in quarter four, and again we\u2019re just starting. That provides plenty of opportunity to continue to drive market growth. We just launched Cascade Platinum Plus - no prewash, no rewash, and again it\u2019s contributing to category growth and category share growth for us, so plenty of opportunity to drive. As to the balance between above the line and below the line, it\u2019s hard to grow categories in volume and value with promotion, so we tend to focus on innovation, superiority and communication investments. When we promote, we would like to do it in a strategic way, so that means driving regimen, for example, combining laundry detergent and fabric enhancers, so a high penetration, low penetration category so that the overall business for our retail partners and for ourselves. Generally, the promo environment continues to be relatively stable and we have no interest in changing that current dynamic.\nJon Moeller: I would just offer a couple thoughts, Bryan, in addition to what Andre said. Pricing isn\u2019t going away in the absolute. It is linked to innovation and we have a very strong innovation pipeline, as Andre partially described. If you look back historically, pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line growth for something like 48 out of 51 of the last quarters, and again as we strengthen our innovation program even further, that will provide opportunities to continue to benefit from modest pricing. The second thing just to be aware of, and Andre mentioned it, when you have a strong innovation program, it compels consumers to try even better performing products, which typically involves a mix benefit, so you\u2019re going to have some amount of pricing going forward, you\u2019re going to have some amount of mix, which you saw for instance in the last quarter. Volume, the trend is very encouraging, as Andre said, both on a global aggregate basis - two quarters ago, volume was minus-6, last quarter minus-3, this quarter minus-1, and as Andre said, we\u2019ve fully turned the corner and are growing volume at very healthy levels in our largest market.  We also have--we will benefit from capacity investments that we\u2019re making currently. We have several categories in the U.S., for example, where we\u2019re currently on allocation on certain forms and freeing up that capacity to fully serve demand, so both retailers and consumers will help as well. Those are just some additional points to consider as you think about this question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks and good morning, Andre, good morning Jon. I guess it\u2019s resolved the debate as to when you think you can return to on-algorithm growth - as you said, Andre, the \u201924 outlook implies that time is now, which is great. I guess the question I\u2019m grappling with is if you are fortunate to see upside as the year progresses, whether it\u2019s from further cost relief, productivity benefits, top line strength, etc., how do you think about using that additional flexibility? I\u2019m sure to some extent, the answer is you\u2019ll reinvest to stay within the algorithm range and preserve longer term momentum, but is there a point or a framework you\u2019d use to assess--you know, flowing through some of those benefits to upside versus the current guide? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Morning Steve. Yes, we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to guide back to algorithm for fiscal \u201924, and as it comes to incremental investment, should we see more momentum or more help from a commodity perspective, the principle we will apply is return on investment, so a very simple principle. We\u2019re not guided by money being available, we\u2019re guided by what is the best path forward to create sustainable value for our shareholders.  We have plenty of opportunity to invest partially in the direction that we mentioned before. You saw media spending, for example, ticking up in quarter four, partially because that\u2019s profiled with innovation and retail events, but as we further develop our ability to target more effectively and efficiently in the media space, we generally see a higher return on investment on every incremental dollar that we spend, so we will carefully push in that direction because we believe that more awareness on stronger innovation and superior products will drive the market and therefore will drive our growth in a constructive way. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve our service levels. As Jon said, we\u2019re adding capacity and we\u2019ll invest and continue to invest in our ability to serve our retail partners even more effectively than we have done in the past, and then we have plenty of opportunity to invest in future productivity. Supply chain 3.0, our digital capabilities, all of those follow the same principles - are they returning reasonable--are they giving us a reasonable return on investment. If they do, we will try to invest; if they don\u2019t, we let the money flow through to earnings. \nJon Moeller: Yes, just emphasizing the point of ROI-based decision making. I don\u2019t--when we\u2019re discussing an opportunity in the market, whether that\u2019s in advertising, product supply, building capability, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked the question, where are we versus our guidance range in terms of the bottom line? That\u2019s just not how we think about things. We\u2019ve reflected a significant amount of investment that we\u2019re very excited about within the guidance range, and we\u2019ll continue looking for opportunities to build return, but that will be the focus.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. Just want to tangent a bit off Bryan\u2019s question, more towards the payback from ad spend and P&G market share performance than the promotion and pricing side of things, which you covered. Obviously another quarter of strong organic sales growth. I know driving category growth is job one, but P&G\u2019s share gains were a bit more modest in the quarter and the fiscal year, so just wanted to get an update on your view of market share performance, how you\u2019re positioned going forward on that front particularly given the recent reinvestment into marketing and the levels of payback you think you\u2019re getting from that. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Let me start. I\u2019m sure Jon will add. I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re very pleased with our market share performance. We are holding global aggregate volume share and value share in the light of very strong pricing contribution to the P&L, which is a great outcome. As Jon mentioned, we see sequential progress in terms of volumes in the market and in our performance, which is the critical outcome as we enter fiscal \u201924.  When you look at the U.S., we continue to drive value share growth of 20 basis points and volume share growth of 50 basis points in the most recent reading, and when you look at our European share, our focus market shares, they\u2019ve turned positive in the past one and two months in European focused markets. All of those things give us great confidence that the strategy of driving superiority and providing value to consumers via innovation at the time when we price is working. Our vertical portfolio across value tiers and across price points in the markets is working, so we\u2019ll continue to double down in that direction. From a U.S. share perspective, we see some trading into private label. Private label shares in aggregate are actually flat in the U.S. at about 16%, so not really growing sequentially, but if you compare versus previous quarter, as we have mentioned before, there is some volatility especially in family care, some in baby care where we would expect as private label and smaller brands return to the shelf, some of those record shares will decrease, and that\u2019s partially what we\u2019re seeing. But structurally, the business is in a very good place and we think we are well positioned to continue our journey on driving market growth and thereby expanding our share premium, which by the way included in our guidance where we said the market is going to grow 4% and we\u2019re going to grow ahead of the market.\nJon Moeller: Only one point to add to that - I agree with everything Andre just said. As you\u2019re looking to see a correlation, Steve, between increased marketing investment in Q4 and market share, as I know you know, it\u2019s not instantaneous. If you just think about purchase cycles as one of the dynamics, we have categories where the purchase cycle is once every six months or once every year even, and so we look at it obviously over longer periods of time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning.  I was hoping to hear a little bit more about the SKU simplification program, because that was news. I know you guys just sent a good amount of time talking about supply chain 3.0, but I was intrigued by this new initiative. I was curious, I guess first geographically, are there particular markets where it\u2019s more pertinent? How far along are you on this process in terms of identifying where the opportunities are, and should we think about that as contributing to existing productivity programs? How does this interact with discussion with retailers and bringing innovation in the market - is it, like, a one-in, one-out? I don\u2019t know, just some more nuance around this program would be interesting. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Morning Lauren. Look, SKU simplification is a category opportunity, and it\u2019s a category opportunity globally across the categories that we operate in. It\u2019s a reality that a very small--that the bottom 25% of SKUs in the categories we operate in deliver a very small contribution to absolute retail sales, so as we think about even better serving our consumers and even better serving our retail partners, it is a logical part of an optimization program to find a better, more efficient shelf. The appealing part for us is the data that we have, based on images of our customers\u2019 shelves in terms of POS data, and the algorithms we have developed to analyze the combination of those two give us great insight on what the right shelf set-up should be and which SKUs we should really focus on with our retail partners to maximize overall sales throughput, and that\u2019s the opportunity we\u2019re going after. It is a program that runs across all categories and it\u2019s a program that runs across all regions. It will be ongoing as we reset shelves and discuss future innovation with our retail partners, and it is part of our program with our retail partners to drive efficiencies and part of our own productivity efforts, because as you can imagine, reducing SKUs in a very complex manufacturing environment frees up capacity and frees up cost, so it\u2019s a multi-benefit space but we\u2019ll take our time to ensure that we do it the right way. There is no standard simple way to do this, so it requires a lot of analysis and a lot of planning with our retail partners to do it right.\nJon Moeller: They are very excited about this opportunity. As I meet with our retail partner CEOs and key managers in those accounts, they\u2019re very anxious to work together on this. A very important emphasis point is that this is sometimes looked at primarily through a bottom line cost saving efficiency lens. That\u2019s now we\u2019re approaching this, though that will be a benefit. We\u2019re really focusing on the opportunity, as Andre said, with a more powerful shelf to grow categories faster, and therefore it\u2019s a top line opportunity for us and our retail partners. We believe that if we do this well, what would normally be considered as some shelf distribution risk through a smaller line up, we can actually convey that into a stronger overall shelf. So it\u2019s multi-faceted, as Andre said, it\u2019s early days working through this, and it will be a category by category, account by account effort, but I think it holds significant opportunity. This is--you asked the question, Lauren, whether this was incremental to the previously communicated productivity numbers. This is part of that and part of how we deliver that, and again has top line benefit as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Thank you, good morning everyone. I actually had just two quick ones, Jon.  On China, can you just provide any on-the-ground color on what\u2019s going on with consumer? I mean, is this still about them feeling comfortable getting out and about in a more normalized routine, or is there something more economic going on? Then the bigger question is obviously supply chains have been disrupted for the past few years. I\u2019m suspecting innovation was disrupted as a result, but now things are getting back to normal. I\u2019m just curious, how do you--how would you frame P&G\u2019s innovation pipeline for fiscal \u201924 relative to a normal year? Is this going to be kind of a bigger year than normal, and then how do you think about getting the space, given that I--you know, what I understand is most companies are going to have a pretty heavy innovation year over the next 12 months, so I\u2019m just curious how you think about spending needs and the ability to get everything you want onto the shelves. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: China, as Andre said in our prepared remarks, continues to recover, not at a significantly rapid pace but steadily, so our business in that country was up 4% in the last quarter and that\u2019s a big improvement from where it was in the first half of the year. There are--you know, there continue to be consumer confidence challenges driven by many factors in China, but again improving month on month. There are some fundamental underlying economic challenges, if you look for example at the employment rates of people in their 20s. It\u2019s very low right now--sorry, the unemployment rate is high, the employment rate is low, unemployment of as much as 20%, so there\u2019s a combination of things, but as always, I hold out great hope for China and our business in it. As I said, we\u2019re beginning to recover nicely as we speak. On the supply chain, several things happened as we rebalanced supply and demand. One is, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we\u2019re able to focus more energy and effort, refocus more energy and effort on productivity, so that\u2019s a significant benefit and that\u2019s included in our assumptions on the guidance. It also makes it easier to get line time to innovate. We have a very strong innovation program that we\u2019re executing currently and obviously expect--as part of our model, we expect to do that going forward.  Our track record--to the point of how do you get things on shelf, our track record speaks for itself, so one of the innovations that Andre was talking about earlier, if you just look at hand dishwashing in the United States and Europe, Down Power Wash and Dawn easy squeeze bottle, those two innovations together drove 17% growth in that business last year, up 1.5 share points in the U.S., up, I think the number is 1.1 share points in Europe, and we\u2019re just getting started with the potential there. But that kind of track record behind innovation makes us a very compelling partner to our retail partners, and that specific example, as you would expect with those kind of numbers, had a significant impact on market growth, which is also of primary importance for them. They don\u2019t really, as you know, don\u2019t really care or aren\u2019t benefited by our share growth unless it is driven by market growth which they benefit from. I think we\u2019re in good shape. When we have great ideas, when we can increase consumer and shopper delight, we\u2019ll be fully present.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Jon, you mentioned, I think in your introductory remarks, that your ecommerce business is now about 17% of total, which has probably doubled in three or four years. Can you maybe kind of stand back and reflect on what that means for your business overall, and maybe concentrating on the U.S., how does that change your relationship with brick and mortar? Has it had an impact on your shelf space in brick and mortar? How has it changed your supply chains, what added complexity it\u2019s given to you, and how has it changed your overall discussion with retailers? I know there\u2019s a lot there, but what are the key things and takeaways that we should get about what\u2019s been a pretty big transformation in terms of channels over the last three or four years? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Robert. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to distinguish between ecommerce and traditional commerce, if you will, even in our conversations with our retail partners. Most of the large brick and mortar retailers are emphasizing the development of ecommerce in different forms themselves and have had significant growth behind those efforts. Honestly, I have not been in a conversation that is zero sum in nature or that is any way combative in nature, more the conversation is how can we work together to fully satisfy our shoppers, many of whom prefer an ecommerce experience. From a pure business standpoint, we aim to be indifferent between channels. We want to have an equally attractive margin, which we generally do, at least in aggregate, and we want a share profile in the different channels that allows us to be indifferent and allows us to support consumers and shoppers in whatever their choice is, wherever they want to go. That\u2019s always work to do, but we stand today in a very good place. Last comment I\u2019d make is just when you think about the growth of ecommerce, in the year that we just completed, as Andre said, it was 7%. That\u2019s the same rate of growth for the total business, so there\u2019s not a tipping exercise that\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s really working to raise all boats.\nAndre Schulten: The only thing I\u2019d add is many of the initiatives we talked about are designed to benefit an omni environment, so both online as well as the physical store. When you think about SKU productivity, it\u2019s absolutely critical when you try to fulfill an online business from shelf because you need the holding power. When you think about supply chain services, our ability to fulfill on behalf of our retail partners directly from our DCs is a significant advantage if you\u2019re in an online environment, but also an opportunity for any brick and mortar retailer. All of those programs are basically channel agnostic - they serve any format within our markets.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, good morning. I have one for Jon and one for Andre. Jon, on the U.S. volume recovery, are you seeing more of a need to defend the entry level pricing with promo? I know I don\u2019t want to sound as if I don\u2019t appreciate all that you said about several initiatives on--not only initiatives, real market share gains in innovation, but I\u2019m just thinking of the private label and value brands you discussed. Do you feel comfortable with your price architecture as it stands now, and do you think that also related to the fabric and fem care basic capacity increase, so you\u2019re now on shelf and you can be more tactical in some price points?  Then Andre, on the cost side for fiscal \u201924, I think that you\u2019re calling a net benefit of $100 million in your net commodities plus FX and plus logistics. I understand that you used the spot prices, and to the extent numbers come in better than that, would you see more of a need to reinvest or potentially flow through some of the savings into the bottom line? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: I\u2019ll start with the commodity question, commodity FX question. You\u2019re right - $800 million [indiscernible] help on commodities offset by $400 million in FX and $200 million in interest expense. A couple of points. One, as we\u2019ve talked before, it takes time for these effects to flow through the P&L, so generally expect them to be more back half weighted versus front half weighted. The same is true with any incremental help, so if we see incremental help, it can take up to six to nine months for it to flow through the P&L, so we need to keep that in mind. But I\u2019ll give you the same answer I think we\u2019ve given before, Andrea - we are ROI driven, and it\u2019s really less defined by do we get more commodity help or less commodity help, are we within guidance range or outside of guidance range. The discussion is, is this the right investment to drive the strategy and create sustainable value, and if it is, we\u2019ll do everything possible to make the investment work. Obviously if commodity help is coming, that\u2019s an easier decision, but we\u2019ll be 100% ROI driven both in the short term and the long term investments.\nJon Moeller: As relates to opening price points, that\u2019s a very fair question and something that we\u2019re always evaluating, as you would expect. But there are several tools that we have available to us to ensure that we\u2019re providing good value to consumers for whom price becomes a challenge. We have pack size, ensuring that we have pack sizes that are accommodated within their cash outlay capacity. Making sure that we have offerings that are right for the channels that consumers typically go to when they come under economic pressure. Ensuring that whether it\u2019s on the package, whether it\u2019s on the shelf, whether it\u2019s in advertising, we\u2019re clearly communicating the value that those offerings provide, and I think you\u2019ll see us going to the utilization of those tools much more frequently to fully delight and satisfy that shopper than we will simply price.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to drill a little bit more into reinvestment, please, and from a different angle. My question really is about retail media spend. We\u2019ve seen a lot of hype, if I can put it that way, about the potential of retail media from the retailers themselves, and in particular the potential for CPG retail media spend to be incremental for the retailers. My question is, can you talk a bit about retail media spend from your perspective, who\u2019s responsible for it within your business - is it the brand teams or your customers teams, and is there a risk that this really will need to be incremental spend or is it just shifting from shopper marketing dollars and legacy media channels? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: I can start and then Jon, if you want to add. For us, any type of media spend, whether it\u2019s digital, online, OTT, TV, print or, as you say, customer media, is part of the total mix, so what we\u2019re looking to do is optimize our reach effectively with a target and a frequency across all of those different touch points, and just like any other channel, retailer media needs to earn its place in our marketing mix model based on the relative return that it can provide.  Now, are we working with our retail partners to maximize that return? Absolutely. There are plenty of opportunities in data sharing, combing transaction data with media data to optimize, and that is a strong reason why retailer-based marketing spending can make sense. But it is part of the overall marketing mix and it\u2019s managed in that way, so really it\u2019s the brand teams that are managing their overall mix and they are collaborating closely with the customer teams, because in many cases, a well timed investment in retail and media in line with merchandising plans on the floor or online can provide superior return on investment.\nJon Moeller: I like generally the concept of retailer media managed in just the way that Andre described, because I just generally believe that the majority of brand choice is made in a retail environment. If we can bring that all together, it offers significant opportunity. I think less brand choice is made sitting on a couch or even driving in a car on the way to a retail establishment. The same is true for online. We\u2019re very carefully evaluating this opportunity, but it will be done in a context that Andre described.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thank you very much. Two questions, first on cost savings. That obviously improved materially as the year progressed, so do you feel like this is a sustainable improvement from here, or to what extent does this perhaps reflect an elevated level after last year\u2019s was a little bit depressed? My second question is just realizing [indiscernible] strong innovation and that\u2019s led to a greater consumer willingness to stay with your premium brands. You alluded--you just talked about Dawn, for example, and that\u2019s obviously driven your ability to grow the category even when consumer are trading down to private label in certain instances, so perhaps you can talk about your innovation plans for fiscal \u201924, how they compare to years past. Thank you. \nAndre Schulten: Morning Olivia. On the cost saving side, we are very confident in our previous statements that we will return to pre-COVID levels across cost of goods, media savings, and general productivity on the overhead side, and I think you saw that play out in quarter four. As line time becomes available, as we have more time with our suppliers, for example, as we start to implement supply chain 3.0, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to create up to $1.5 billion of net savings within the supply chain. We continue to generate significant amount of savings via our media programs, and every business is looking at productivity opportunities to balance labor and wage cost inflation within the overhead structure, so I think quarter four is a good indication that we are able to do just that - get back to pre-COVID levels of productivity within those buckets that I described. In terms of innovation, what I\u2019d tell you is, number one, we never stopped innovation, so we prioritized strong innovation throughout COVID and supply chain struggles because we knew that was the only way to create value for our retail partners and for our consumers as we had to take significant pricing in addition to productivity to offset the commodity cost increases that we saw. It\u2019s also important to register that our innovation is not just premium innovation. We are innovating across all value tiers because the concept of superiority requires us to be competitive or superior at every price tier, so on a brand like Luvs, for example, which is a value brand in diapers in the U.S., we\u2019re competing against private label offerings, so we need to be able to be superior and have the right innovation to do just that.  I continue to see us very strong on innovation capability. We gave you a list of examples. There are plenty more, and I think the biggest strength we have is the hit rate that we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate is very good, and as Jon mentioned, that gives confidence to retailers to support our innovation, which is the biggest help that we can get in addition to just truly consumer-based innovation, having the support of our retail partners to bring it on and to drive category growth, and that allows us to create sustainable share growth for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks Operator, and good morning everyone. I was hoping to get some color in terms of how to think about the gross margin progression. You mentioned in response to Andrea\u2019s question about the $800 million of deflation will be more back half weighted, but it still seems you will have some healthy tailwinds from productivity and price, so just any thoughts in terms of how to think about the [indiscernible] of gross margin as commodity cost pricing and productivity evolves, just in the context of such strong momentum exiting this year. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Morning Peter. Look, I\u2019ll leave it we\u2019re starting--just starting to recover a lot of the gross margin that was impacted by the commodity cost inflation. Obviously our objective is to continue to recover and get back to pre-COVID levels and then grow from there. Our algorithm requires with mid single digit top line growth, mid to high single digit EPS growth requires somewhere between 20 and 60 basis points of operating margin expansion, and a part of that will have to come from gross margin expansion because, as we said, we strive to continue to invest in the business across innovation, across communication to drive superiority. I won\u2019t give you detailed guidance, but we\u2019re still on the path to recovering back to pre-COVID levels.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning everyone. Just a clarification on your organic sales growth guidance. You mentioned you expected global markets to grow 4% with modest growth in volume. Can you break down what are you expectations for your volume assumptions for \u201924, and even just in terms of cadence, could we see, given the strong improvement that you saw in Q4, some volume growth at a total company level even in the first half of the year, or do you think it\u2019s more of second half in terms of volume growth for P&G? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, maybe starting by deconstructing the global market growth number, we expect a point to a point and a half of that over our fiscal year to come from volume, so these are global market growth numbers, a point to a point and a half in volume. Same amount from mix, same amount from price. We strive to grow ahead of that. What exactly the composition of our growth is, I think will depend and we\u2019ll see, though if I had to give you a number, I don\u2019t think I could at this point in time. We expect sequential progress on the volume line, let\u2019s put it that way, and we will do everything possible to make that progress happen by driving market growth, because specifically on the volume side, that will be the most constructive way to drive our growth in \u201924.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hey, good morning. Just two quick questions from me. First, with leverage where it\u2019s trending, free cash flow generation strong, why not buy back more stock or be guiding to more buybacks for the year? Second, good progress on SK-II in the quarter. Can we just get any context on where you think the brand sits today, some of the channel health and--it seems to be quite an important driver of growth, and just want to get some context on whether we can get back to those sorts of--you know, that sort of contribution on a more durable basis going forward. Thanks so much. \nAndre Schulten: Got it. Yes, Chris, on free cash flow, I\u2019ll just tell you our capital allocation priorities haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019ll fully fund the business. We will pay the dividend, we will do M&A where it makes sense, and then we will return cash via share repurchase. Just keep in mind, we had two years where operating income was severely limited because of the recovery of commodity cost increase and foreign exchange, so that explains, I think, a little bit of that share repurchase number being a little bit lower. If you look at the average, we\u2019re still returning $14 billion to $15 billion to share owners, which is right in line with what we\u2019ve been doing over previous years. On SK-II, 20% growth in the quarter looks great on the headline. Just keep in mind, we\u2019re building that off of a very weak base period with Shanghai lockdowns, so I wouldn\u2019t want you to extrapolate that straight into fiscal \u201924. I think most importantly, the team is doing a great job in putting SK-II on a solid footing both from a channel perspective, making sure that the pricing across different channels - travel retail, l domestic travel retail and domestic markets, is in a sustainable place. They are investing in the core equity of the brand with a new campaign, and they are building retail support and trial. All of those things, I believe, are a good indicator of where we\u2019re headed, and early signs within China, for example, are very strong, positive consumer reviews and initially positive share growth, so we\u2019re headed in the right direction but probably not quite at the clip you saw in quarter four. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and good morning everyone. I actually ironically wanted to ask about SK-II, but more in a portfolio construct view. How do you think about prestige beauty fitting into your portfolio? I think it\u2019s been a question for years in terms of just go to market and synergies with the rest of the beauty business. You\u2019ve obviously done some selective M&A, not necessarily co-selling that with SK-II in certain businesses and markets, so I guess as you take a step back and look at the volatility, obviously it\u2019s partly COVID related, over the last three, four years there\u2019s been volatility there, markets improving but some signs that the go-to-market that existed three years ago, four years ago pre-COVID is shifting in terms of how you sell those products, so are the same synergies in going to market there today versus where you were a few years ago? Are you still getting the same synergies in terms of flow through to technology through using [indiscernible], and then related to all of that, how do you think about that current portfolio today? Does it need to be bigger, does it need to be shifted a bit in categories, or are you content with where you are?  Longwinded question, but all sort of related to SK-II. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: As you know, we want to be present in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, so we love SK-II in that context and it\u2019s performed very well over the years. But as you indicated, the more recent volatility is due to channel dynamics and COVID dynamics, all of which are beginning to turn more favorable. That will take a little bit of time, but this is a brand that we like. We have said that from a portfolio standpoint, there are two categories that we\u2019re most interested in from an acquisition standpoint, albeit in a very disciplined way, and those are the same two categories where we\u2019ve been making smaller acquisitions. Those two categories are personal healthcare and skin care. \nOperator: The final question comes from Bill Chappell of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Chappell: Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just a question on grooming - one, I might have missed what was going on in Europe, so if you can kind of clarify that in the disruption; but two, this seems to be kind of the best category to gauge pandemic behavior, if it pulled back meaningfully during the pandemic. Obviously we\u2019ve had a reopening for the past two years, so can you maybe give us the state of the state of that industry as we go into what looks like a normalized next 12 months? Are we normalized, or--I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re even back to where we were in 2019. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, look - if you look at the grooming business, I would first tell you the last two quarters have been very strong quarters. The Braun business, so the more appliance side of the business had been annualized a very strong base period during the pandemic as more and more folks have brought some of these jobs in-house versus going to barber shops or beauty salons, and obviously that had a very high base so we\u2019re annualizing that base. On the core grooming side when you think about male blades and razors, female hair removal or beard care, I think the business has done a fantastic job in expanding the jobs to be done that we cover, and driving honestly market growth across each of those segments, and that will continue.  In terms of future outlook, we feel very good about the business recovering already in the second half, mainly from the mainly from the Braun strong base period, and I think the plan for current fiscal year are strong.\nJon Moeller: I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. We appreciate it. We know this is a busy morning for you. We\u2019ll let you get onto other things. I just want to provide one last recognition of the team here at P&G who is working hard to serve consumers, customers, each other, society, and of course our share owners.  Thank you for your interest.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Thanks Andre. I want to talk briefly about this company, its strategy and our organization both as a step-back reflection on what's been accomplished and as a glimpse forward to what's possible.  Three quick reflections looking back: first, pre-COVID, during COVID and since COVID, pre-inflation and since inflation, consistent strong top line growth across categories and geographies, core earnings for share growth for each of the last five fiscal years, consistent cash return to share owners. Our strategy has sustained us through all of this.  Second look back, in the past two years, nearly half of our earnings wiped out by commodities, transportation and foreign exchange headwinds, yet we still grew earnings per share in each of those years while delivering 7% organic sales growth each year, increasing investment in innovation, brand building and growing markets, and growing market share in aggregate in the process.  As I said last quarter, if you told me four years ago that we would grow top line and bottom line and deliver strong cash return to share owners through a global pandemic with employees challenged to get to the workplace, in the context of a war in Europe, major disruption in global supply chains, rapidly escalating costs, the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, and fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and channel relevance, it would have been hard to agree, but that's exactly what this team has done. Over the last five years, they've added over $15 billion in incremental sales, grown our share of the global market, grown core earnings per share by 40%, and returned over $80 billion of cash to share owners.  Two more granular examples testing both strategy and execution in some of the harshest conditions, Latin America - significant devaluation across all major currencies, inflation in Brazil peaking at above 12%, 9% in Mexico, over 70% in Argentina. Despite this, our team has delivered three consecutive years of U.S. dollar sales growth, mid teens in fiscal '22 and mid 20s this year. Market share growth on both a volume and value basis, nearly 30% profit growth this year in dollars, over 50% on a local currency basis.  One more test - Turkey, over the past two years, the lira has devalued more than 300%. We had to take multiple ways of significant pricing; still, the strength of our strategy and its execution by the organization has enabled us to grow dollar sales, grow volume, sequentially improve market share, and maintain dollar profitability in the market. As you well know, past performance is no guarantee of future results and certainly no excuse to stand still - quite the opposite. There will be bumps in the road ahead. We're still navigating through plenty of challenges right now. Each of these look backs, though, gives us confidence in the effectiveness of the strategy grounded in and focused on consumers and an appreciation for the capabilities of our talented, creative, agile and committed organization.  Our integrated strategy, a focused portfolio of products in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. Superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with our retail partners. Productivity to offset cost challenges while funding investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth. We're re-accelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste. Constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry to adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that often extend our competitive advantage, and an organization structure that's increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable, an increasingly diverse organization now with 50% female representation in manager roles across the world. We're strengthening the execution of our strategy in four focus areas. First with supply chain 3.0, we're driving improved capacity, greater agility, flexibility, scalability, transparency and resilience, along with greater productivity. We recently launched a platform of supply chain services to enable best-in-class service and streamline the end-to-end supply chain. These initiatives have been very well received by retailers.  Our next step to drive joint value creation with retailers is to simplify our SKU portfolio, to improve the shopping experience, increase on-shelf availability and further streamline supply for the entire ecosystem, higher quality, more transparency, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products. Each improves superiority with consumers and improves what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retain partners and third party industry surveys. All of this is a huge value creation opportunity for P&G and our retail partners. Next focus area, environmental sustainability, to create superior propositions for consumers, customers and shareholders while improving our environmental impact. Reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges.  Third, digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value; and fourth, a superior employee value equation for all genders, identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. We stand by people and support them in small but meaningful ways every day with superior performing products at a superior value. We strive to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G's values and principles. This approach with consumers at the center and an organization built to serve them has served us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, society will benefit, and shareholders will continue to be rewarded for their investment, not measured by a quarter or even a year but over time. I believe in this company, in our organization, it's capabilities and in the commitment of P&G people to serve consumers. I'm excited about what lays ahead. Of course, I have my worries and concerns and we'll continue to face challenges and some dark days and nights, but the future in general holds great promise. We'll continue to be guided by our purpose, values and principles and relentless execution of our strategy to move forward to an ever-brighter dawn. P&G celebrates its 186th anniversary this year. I believe we have an even stronger hand to play today than we've had historically. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year. We're very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging operating cost and competitive environment over the last five years. Excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners  With that, Andre and I will be happy to take your questions. I would just offer a couple thoughts, Bryan, in addition to what Andre said. Pricing isn't going away in the absolute. It is linked to innovation and we have a very strong innovation pipeline, as Andre partially described. If you look back historically, pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line growth for something like 48 out of 51 of the last quarters, and again as we strengthen our innovation program even further, that will provide opportunities to continue to benefit from modest pricing. The second thing just to be aware of, and Andre mentioned it, when you have a strong innovation program, it compels consumers to try even better performing products, which typically involves a mix benefit, so you're going to have some amount of pricing going forward, you're going to have some amount of mix, which you saw for instance in the last quarter. Volume, the trend is very encouraging, as Andre said, both on a global aggregate basis - two quarters ago, volume was minus-6, last quarter minus-3, this quarter minus-1, and as Andre said, we've fully turned the corner and are growing volume at very healthy levels in our largest market.  We also have--we will benefit from capacity investments that we're making currently. We have several categories in the U.S., for example, where we're currently on allocation on certain forms and freeing up that capacity to fully serve demand, so both retailers and consumers will help as well. Those are just some additional points to consider as you think about this question. Yes, just emphasizing the point of ROI-based decision making. I don't--when we're discussing an opportunity in the market, whether that's in advertising, product supply, building capability, I don't think I've ever asked the question, where are we versus our guidance range in terms of the bottom line? That's just not how we think about things. We've reflected a significant amount of investment that we're very excited about within the guidance range, and we'll continue looking for opportunities to build return, but that will be the focus. Only one point to add to that - I agree with everything Andre just said. As you're looking to see a correlation, Steve, between increased marketing investment in Q4 and market share, as I know you know, it's not instantaneous. If you just think about purchase cycles as one of the dynamics, we have categories where the purchase cycle is once every six months or once every year even, and so we look at it obviously over longer periods of time. They are very excited about this opportunity. As I meet with our retail partner CEOs and key managers in those accounts, they're very anxious to work together on this. A very important emphasis point is that this is sometimes looked at primarily through a bottom line cost saving efficiency lens. That's now we're approaching this, though that will be a benefit. We're really focusing on the opportunity, as Andre said, with a more powerful shelf to grow categories faster, and therefore it's a top line opportunity for us and our retail partners. We believe that if we do this well, what would normally be considered as some shelf distribution risk through a smaller line up, we can actually convey that into a stronger overall shelf. So it's multi-faceted, as Andre said, it's early days working through this, and it will be a category by category, account by account effort, but I think it holds significant opportunity. This is--you asked the question, Lauren, whether this was incremental to the previously communicated productivity numbers. This is part of that and part of how we deliver that, and again has top line benefit as well. China, as Andre said in our prepared remarks, continues to recover, not at a significantly rapid pace but steadily, so our business in that country was up 4% in the last quarter and that's a big improvement from where it was in the first half of the year. There are--you know, there continue to be consumer confidence challenges driven by many factors in China, but again improving month on month. There are some fundamental underlying economic challenges, if you look for example at the employment rates of people in their 20s. It's very low right now--sorry, the unemployment rate is high, the employment rate is low, unemployment of as much as 20%, so there's a combination of things, but as always, I hold out great hope for China and our business in it. As I said, we're beginning to recover nicely as we speak. On the supply chain, several things happened as we rebalanced supply and demand. One is, and we've talked about this before, we're able to focus more energy and effort, refocus more energy and effort on productivity, so that's a significant benefit and that's included in our assumptions on the guidance. It also makes it easier to get line time to innovate. We have a very strong innovation program that we're executing currently and obviously expect--as part of our model, we expect to do that going forward.  Our track record--to the point of how do you get things on shelf, our track record speaks for itself, so one of the innovations that Andre was talking about earlier, if you just look at hand dishwashing in the United States and Europe, Down Power Wash and Dawn easy squeeze bottle, those two innovations together drove 17% growth in that business last year, up 1.5 share points in the U.S., up, I think the number is 1.1 share points in Europe, and we're just getting started with the potential there. But that kind of track record behind innovation makes us a very compelling partner to our retail partners, and that specific example, as you would expect with those kind of numbers, had a significant impact on market growth, which is also of primary importance for them. They don't really, as you know, don't really care or aren't benefited by our share growth unless it is driven by market growth which they benefit from. I think we're in good shape. When we have great ideas, when we can increase consumer and shopper delight, we'll be fully present. Thanks Robert. It's getting harder and harder to distinguish between ecommerce and traditional commerce, if you will, even in our conversations with our retail partners. Most of the large brick and mortar retailers are emphasizing the development of ecommerce in different forms themselves and have had significant growth behind those efforts. Honestly, I have not been in a conversation that is zero sum in nature or that is any way combative in nature, more the conversation is how can we work together to fully satisfy our shoppers, many of whom prefer an ecommerce experience. From a pure business standpoint, we aim to be indifferent between channels. We want to have an equally attractive margin, which we generally do, at least in aggregate, and we want a share profile in the different channels that allows us to be indifferent and allows us to support consumers and shoppers in whatever their choice is, wherever they want to go. That's always work to do, but we stand today in a very good place. Last comment I'd make is just when you think about the growth of ecommerce, in the year that we just completed, as Andre said, it was 7%. That's the same rate of growth for the total business, so there's not a tipping exercise that's going on here. It's really working to raise all boats. As relates to opening price points, that's a very fair question and something that we're always evaluating, as you would expect. But there are several tools that we have available to us to ensure that we're providing good value to consumers for whom price becomes a challenge. We have pack size, ensuring that we have pack sizes that are accommodated within their cash outlay capacity. Making sure that we have offerings that are right for the channels that consumers typically go to when they come under economic pressure. Ensuring that whether it's on the package, whether it's on the shelf, whether it's in advertising, we're clearly communicating the value that those offerings provide, and I think you'll see us going to the utilization of those tools much more frequently to fully delight and satisfy that shopper than we will simply price. I like generally the concept of retailer media managed in just the way that Andre described, because I just generally believe that the majority of brand choice is made in a retail environment. If we can bring that all together, it offers significant opportunity. I think less brand choice is made sitting on a couch or even driving in a car on the way to a retail establishment. The same is true for online. We're very carefully evaluating this opportunity, but it will be done in a context that Andre described. As you know, we want to be present in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, so we love SK-II in that context and it's performed very well over the years. But as you indicated, the more recent volatility is due to channel dynamics and COVID dynamics, all of which are beginning to turn more favorable. That will take a little bit of time, but this is a brand that we like. We have said that from a portfolio standpoint, there are two categories that we're most interested in from an acquisition standpoint, albeit in a very disciplined way, and those are the same two categories where we've been making smaller acquisitions. Those two categories are personal healthcare and skin care. I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. We appreciate it. We know this is a busy morning for you. We'll let you get onto other things. I just want to provide one last recognition of the team here at P&G who is working hard to serve consumers, customers, each other, society, and of course our share owners.  Thank you for your interest."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "With me today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '23 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal '24 and then take your questions. Fiscal '23 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategy continues to yield broad-based strong sales growth across categories and regions, strong earnings in the face of significant cost headwinds, and continued strong return on cash to P&G shareholders.  Organic sales for the fiscal year grew 7%, our second consecutive year of 7% organic sales growth and fifth consecutive year of 5% or better organic growth starting fiscal 2019 - 5%, 6%, 6%, 7% and 7%. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal healthcare grew mid-teens, feminine care grew double digits, fabric care, home care and hair care up high single digits, skin and personal care, baby care, family care and grooming each grew mid singles. Oral care grew low single digits. Focus markets were up 5% for the year and we delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 6% on top of a strong 8% growth comp in the base period. Greater China organic sales were down low single digits versus the prior year, with trends improving in the back half as the market continues to slowly recover. Enterprise markets were up 15% led by Latin America with 24% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 7%, now representing 17% of total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth is in turn driving share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 7% in fiscal '23. P&G consumption grew ahead of fair share of category growth, driving modest value share growth and volume share up 50 basis points for the year. We held global aggregate market share. Twenty-nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Seven of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $5.90, up 2% for the year despite a 24 percentage point earnings growth headwind, or $1.38 from share from higher material costs and foreign exchange. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS was up 11%.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We increased our dividend by 3% and returned over $16 billion of value to share owners, $9 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase.  Moving to the April to June quarter, organic sales grew 8%. We have now delivered seven consecutive quarters with 5% or better organic sales growth. Pricing contributed seven points to organic sales growth, mix was up 2 points, volume declined one point, improving sequentially versus the March quarter, as expected. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Skin and personal care, personal healthcare, home care, feminine care, and family care, five of our 10 categories, each grew double digits. Baby care, hair care and grooming grew high singles, fabric care grew mid singles, and oral care was up low single digits.  Each of our seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 7% and enterprise markets up 13% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%. Importantly, this includes 3 points of volume growth, a return to positive volume in our largest market for the first time in five quarters. Greater China organic sales grew 4%. We continue to see sequential market recovery, but as expected at a slow pace. European focused market organic sales were up 12% despite volume pressure from wider pricing gaps. In enterprise markets, Latin America led the growth with organic sales up 22%.  Global aggregate market share increased 10 basis points. Twenty nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the quarter.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 22%.  Core operating margin increased 190 basis points as benefits from strong sales growth and productivity improvements more than offset higher material cost, foreign exchange headwinds, wage and benefit inflation, and reinvestment in higher media reach and frequency. Currency neutral operating margin increased 310 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 136%. We returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to share owners in the quarter.  In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year: organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash returned to share owners, strong performance again this year in a very difficult operating environment.  Now I'll pass it over to Jon. Thank you Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past three years and as Jon indicated, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead, and while supply chains and input costs have become more stable as we enter fiscal '24, the challenges we face are multi-faceted: economic, geopolitical, and societal, putting pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets. We'll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers with every step. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24. Foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind and, based on current rates, we now expect a $400 million after-tax impact. We still face above normal levels of wage and benefit cost inflation in our cost structure and higher costs for third party services. In addition, we expect below-the-line impact from higher net interest expense to be a roughly $200 million after tax earnings headwind. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 4%, with the drivers of market growth normalizing as we move through the year, pricing becoming less of a driver and volume returning to modest growth. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for fiscal '24.  On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% versus fiscal year '23 EPS of $5.90. This guidance equates to a range of $6.25 to $6.43 per share, $6.34 or up 7.5% at the center of the range. With a three-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 9% to 12% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories.  We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year.  Top line, bottom line and cash guidance for fiscal '24 all consistent with our long term algorithm. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, more store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. These guidance ranges also do not assume a further reduction in commodity and material costs versus current levels. If this should occur, it would generate greater flexibility to invest more in value-accretive innovation and marketing opportunities. With that, I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Yes, good morning Bryan. I'll start. Look, our strategy is to grow categories, and that is the same strategy we'll execute in fiscal '24, and that means growing categories across volume and value. I think we take great comfort in the U.S. results, where we already see volume growth in quarter four of 3%, which is half of the growth we saw in the quarter of 6% in terms of sales.  Driving volume and value category growth, in our mind, is best done via innovation and by driving superiority across the five vectors that we have defined: product, package, communication, go-to-market, and value, and we see plenty of opportunity across our categories to drive household penetration, drive usage occasions, drive new jobs to be done with all physical and mental levers that are available to us, so we'll continue to invest in that direction.  We have plenty of innovation that is doing just that. Just to give you a few examples, if you look at China, Safeguard China is the number one PCC brand and Detox body wash, which is two times the market average price, has almost doubled in fiscal '23 and will continue to build on that strength by driving better awareness and even more awareness on that brand. In Europe, Ariel four-chamber unit dose and the ECOCLIC packaging, very strong results contributed to more than 20% sales growth in quarter four, and again we're just starting. That provides plenty of opportunity to continue to drive market growth. We just launched Cascade Platinum Plus - no prewash, no rewash, and again it's contributing to category growth and category share growth for us, so plenty of opportunity to drive. As to the balance between above the line and below the line, it's hard to grow categories in volume and value with promotion, so we tend to focus on innovation, superiority and communication investments. When we promote, we would like to do it in a strategic way, so that means driving regimen, for example, combining laundry detergent and fabric enhancers, so a high penetration, low penetration category so that the overall business for our retail partners and for ourselves. Generally, the promo environment continues to be relatively stable and we have no interest in changing that current dynamic. Morning Steve. Yes, we're very pleased that we were able to guide back to algorithm for fiscal '24, and as it comes to incremental investment, should we see more momentum or more help from a commodity perspective, the principle we will apply is return on investment, so a very simple principle. We're not guided by money being available, we're guided by what is the best path forward to create sustainable value for our shareholders.  We have plenty of opportunity to invest partially in the direction that we mentioned before. You saw media spending, for example, ticking up in quarter four, partially because that's profiled with innovation and retail events, but as we further develop our ability to target more effectively and efficiently in the media space, we generally see a higher return on investment on every incremental dollar that we spend, so we will carefully push in that direction because we believe that more awareness on stronger innovation and superior products will drive the market and therefore will drive our growth in a constructive way. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve our service levels. As Jon said, we're adding capacity and we'll invest and continue to invest in our ability to serve our retail partners even more effectively than we have done in the past, and then we have plenty of opportunity to invest in future productivity. Supply chain 3.0, our digital capabilities, all of those follow the same principles - are they returning reasonable--are they giving us a reasonable return on investment. If they do, we will try to invest; if they don't, we let the money flow through to earnings. Let me start. I'm sure Jon will add. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with our market share performance. We are holding global aggregate volume share and value share in the light of very strong pricing contribution to the P&L, which is a great outcome. As Jon mentioned, we see sequential progress in terms of volumes in the market and in our performance, which is the critical outcome as we enter fiscal '24.  When you look at the U.S., we continue to drive value share growth of 20 basis points and volume share growth of 50 basis points in the most recent reading, and when you look at our European share, our focus market shares, they've turned positive in the past one and two months in European focused markets. All of those things give us great confidence that the strategy of driving superiority and providing value to consumers via innovation at the time when we price is working. Our vertical portfolio across value tiers and across price points in the markets is working, so we'll continue to double down in that direction. From a U.S. share perspective, we see some trading into private label. Private label shares in aggregate are actually flat in the U.S. at about 16%, so not really growing sequentially, but if you compare versus previous quarter, as we have mentioned before, there is some volatility especially in family care, some in baby care where we would expect as private label and smaller brands return to the shelf, some of those record shares will decrease, and that's partially what we're seeing. But structurally, the business is in a very good place and we think we are well positioned to continue our journey on driving market growth and thereby expanding our share premium, which by the way included in our guidance where we said the market is going to grow 4% and we're going to grow ahead of the market. Morning Lauren. Look, SKU simplification is a category opportunity, and it's a category opportunity globally across the categories that we operate in. It's a reality that a very small--that the bottom 25% of SKUs in the categories we operate in deliver a very small contribution to absolute retail sales, so as we think about even better serving our consumers and even better serving our retail partners, it is a logical part of an optimization program to find a better, more efficient shelf. The appealing part for us is the data that we have, based on images of our customers' shelves in terms of POS data, and the algorithms we have developed to analyze the combination of those two give us great insight on what the right shelf set-up should be and which SKUs we should really focus on with our retail partners to maximize overall sales throughput, and that's the opportunity we're going after. It is a program that runs across all categories and it's a program that runs across all regions. It will be ongoing as we reset shelves and discuss future innovation with our retail partners, and it is part of our program with our retail partners to drive efficiencies and part of our own productivity efforts, because as you can imagine, reducing SKUs in a very complex manufacturing environment frees up capacity and frees up cost, so it's a multi-benefit space but we'll take our time to ensure that we do it the right way. There is no standard simple way to do this, so it requires a lot of analysis and a lot of planning with our retail partners to do it right. The only thing I'd add is many of the initiatives we talked about are designed to benefit an omni environment, so both online as well as the physical store. When you think about SKU productivity, it's absolutely critical when you try to fulfill an online business from shelf because you need the holding power. When you think about supply chain services, our ability to fulfill on behalf of our retail partners directly from our DCs is a significant advantage if you're in an online environment, but also an opportunity for any brick and mortar retailer. All of those programs are basically channel agnostic - they serve any format within our markets. I'll start with the commodity question, commodity FX question. You're right - $800 million [indiscernible] help on commodities offset by $400 million in FX and $200 million in interest expense. A couple of points. One, as we've talked before, it takes time for these effects to flow through the P&L, so generally expect them to be more back half weighted versus front half weighted. The same is true with any incremental help, so if we see incremental help, it can take up to six to nine months for it to flow through the P&L, so we need to keep that in mind. But I'll give you the same answer I think we've given before, Andrea - we are ROI driven, and it's really less defined by do we get more commodity help or less commodity help, are we within guidance range or outside of guidance range. The discussion is, is this the right investment to drive the strategy and create sustainable value, and if it is, we'll do everything possible to make the investment work. Obviously if commodity help is coming, that's an easier decision, but we'll be 100% ROI driven both in the short term and the long term investments. I can start and then Jon, if you want to add. For us, any type of media spend, whether it's digital, online, OTT, TV, print or, as you say, customer media, is part of the total mix, so what we're looking to do is optimize our reach effectively with a target and a frequency across all of those different touch points, and just like any other channel, retailer media needs to earn its place in our marketing mix model based on the relative return that it can provide.  Now, are we working with our retail partners to maximize that return? Absolutely. There are plenty of opportunities in data sharing, combing transaction data with media data to optimize, and that is a strong reason why retailer-based marketing spending can make sense. But it is part of the overall marketing mix and it's managed in that way, so really it's the brand teams that are managing their overall mix and they are collaborating closely with the customer teams, because in many cases, a well timed investment in retail and media in line with merchandising plans on the floor or online can provide superior return on investment. Morning Olivia. On the cost saving side, we are very confident in our previous statements that we will return to pre-COVID levels across cost of goods, media savings, and general productivity on the overhead side, and I think you saw that play out in quarter four. As line time becomes available, as we have more time with our suppliers, for example, as we start to implement supply chain 3.0, we're very confident in our ability to create up to $1.5 billion of net savings within the supply chain. We continue to generate significant amount of savings via our media programs, and every business is looking at productivity opportunities to balance labor and wage cost inflation within the overhead structure, so I think quarter four is a good indication that we are able to do just that - get back to pre-COVID levels of productivity within those buckets that I described. In terms of innovation, what I'd tell you is, number one, we never stopped innovation, so we prioritized strong innovation throughout COVID and supply chain struggles because we knew that was the only way to create value for our retail partners and for our consumers as we had to take significant pricing in addition to productivity to offset the commodity cost increases that we saw. It's also important to register that our innovation is not just premium innovation. We are innovating across all value tiers because the concept of superiority requires us to be competitive or superior at every price tier, so on a brand like Luvs, for example, which is a value brand in diapers in the U.S., we're competing against private label offerings, so we need to be able to be superior and have the right innovation to do just that.  I continue to see us very strong on innovation capability. We gave you a list of examples. There are plenty more, and I think the biggest strength we have is the hit rate that we've been able to demonstrate is very good, and as Jon mentioned, that gives confidence to retailers to support our innovation, which is the biggest help that we can get in addition to just truly consumer-based innovation, having the support of our retail partners to bring it on and to drive category growth, and that allows us to create sustainable share growth for us. Morning Peter. Look, I'll leave it we're starting--just starting to recover a lot of the gross margin that was impacted by the commodity cost inflation. Obviously our objective is to continue to recover and get back to pre-COVID levels and then grow from there. Our algorithm requires with mid single digit top line growth, mid to high single digit EPS growth requires somewhere between 20 and 60 basis points of operating margin expansion, and a part of that will have to come from gross margin expansion because, as we said, we strive to continue to invest in the business across innovation, across communication to drive superiority. I won't give you detailed guidance, but we're still on the path to recovering back to pre-COVID levels. Yes, maybe starting by deconstructing the global market growth number, we expect a point to a point and a half of that over our fiscal year to come from volume, so these are global market growth numbers, a point to a point and a half in volume. Same amount from mix, same amount from price. We strive to grow ahead of that. What exactly the composition of our growth is, I think will depend and we'll see, though if I had to give you a number, I don't think I could at this point in time. We expect sequential progress on the volume line, let's put it that way, and we will do everything possible to make that progress happen by driving market growth, because specifically on the volume side, that will be the most constructive way to drive our growth in '24. Got it. Yes, Chris, on free cash flow, I'll just tell you our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. We'll fully fund the business. We will pay the dividend, we will do M&A where it makes sense, and then we will return cash via share repurchase. Just keep in mind, we had two years where operating income was severely limited because of the recovery of commodity cost increase and foreign exchange, so that explains, I think, a little bit of that share repurchase number being a little bit lower. If you look at the average, we're still returning $14 billion to $15 billion to share owners, which is right in line with what we've been doing over previous years. On SK-II, 20% growth in the quarter looks great on the headline. Just keep in mind, we're building that off of a very weak base period with Shanghai lockdowns, so I wouldn't want you to extrapolate that straight into fiscal '24. I think most importantly, the team is doing a great job in putting SK-II on a solid footing both from a channel perspective, making sure that the pricing across different channels - travel retail, l domestic travel retail and domestic markets, is in a sustainable place. They are investing in the core equity of the brand with a new campaign, and they are building retail support and trial. All of those things, I believe, are a good indicator of where we're headed, and early signs within China, for example, are very strong, positive consumer reviews and initially positive share growth, so we're headed in the right direction but probably not quite at the clip you saw in quarter four. Yes, look - if you look at the grooming business, I would first tell you the last two quarters have been very strong quarters. The Braun business, so the more appliance side of the business had been annualized a very strong base period during the pandemic as more and more folks have brought some of these jobs in-house versus going to barber shops or beauty salons, and obviously that had a very high base so we're annualizing that base. On the core grooming side when you think about male blades and razors, female hair removal or beard care, I think the business has done a fantastic job in expanding the jobs to be done that we cover, and driving honestly market growth across each of those segments, and that will continue.  In terms of future outlook, we feel very good about the business recovering already in the second half, mainly from the mainly from the Braun strong base period, and I think the plan for current fiscal year are strong. Thanks everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends, and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Mueller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories in -- and in six out of seven regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady, productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands. In-market execution across all five vectors of superiority is strong and consistent: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to shareowners, and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity. Moving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens, Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits, Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits, Baby Care was up mid singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles. Growth was also broad based across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe focus markets were up 8%. Greater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year, as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer-term, we expect China to return to mid singles underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories. Enterprise markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30% and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all five sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets. Global aggregate value share was in line with prior year, with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with eight of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year, driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year. Strong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants, as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the power wash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands. In Europe, the new four-chamber Ariel Platinum PODS are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care. Fairy Power Spray is growing the dish category and building market share in Home Care. The new GilletteLabs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in grooming. Moving to the bottom-line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points, as 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%. We returned $3.6 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top-line, bottom-line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value, we are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, extend margins and deliver strong cash generation, an approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. There are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies, they are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top- and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now, moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic. We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment, and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward. On the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient, with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supply inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months, but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year. Freight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after-tax, or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As noted in the outset, our strong results over the first three quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top-line growth we've averaged over the last four years, which were 5%, 6%, 6% and 7% from fiscal '19 through '22, respectively. On the bottom-line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations toward the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as we value -- as value creating opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics. We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. As we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a bit about productivity, because over the last, I guess, two-and-a-half, three years during the pandemic and all the global supply chain challenges, productivity was something that understandably took a back seat. And then, this quarter really seen this significant change in what you've been able to realize. So, I was curious if there is -- if we should be thinking about productivity of something where there's, like, a catch up, where there's sort of projects that have been on the list, things you were able to get at, so that productivity could run at an elevated rate going forward? And it's also interesting I think in the context of marketing, how you've been so consistent in investing throughout? There's actually no catch-up on the marketing piece. No need to accelerate reinvestment per se, but maybe some, again, acceleration on the productivity side. So, I'd be curious to hear about that. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Great. Good morning, Lauren. I think, as you said, we are catching up right now to return to gross savings levels that are equal or close to equal to those that we've delivered pre-COVID. We have more line capacity available for us to qualify cost savings or mind space of our teams to be able to identify new opportunities. And as we are able to engage suppliers and get through this inflationary period, hopefully, more ideation and new projects to be created as well. As we've talked on our Investor Day, we see runway on productivity for the next few years, driven by Supply Chain 3.0. We have talked about delivering about $1.5 billion of savings with those initiatives between automation and digital capabilities. And we continue to believe that we can generate between $400 million to $500 million a year from media, programmatic savings both in terms of scheduling and buying capabilities around the world. Those programs will hold productivity, in my estimation, close to pre-COVID levels, which will allow us to continue to reinvest in media, which will allow us to fund innovation and superiority, and that is really the intent of the model. So, to answer your question directly, I would not expect a disproportionate catch up, but I would expect a steady return to pre-COVID levels of net structure savings, both the cost and media.\nJon Moeller: I agree.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I actually had just one clarification and then a question. The clarification, the $125 million of, I guess, incremental interest expense, can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And again, is that something we need to kind of contemplate in our models as even we look past the fourth quarter? So, I guess, is net interest expense going up?\nAndre Schulten: Yeah, morning, Bryan. Yes, I mean, obviously, it is, right? Markets are getting more expensive in terms of credit and we are not immune to that. So, the $125 million [BT] (ph) we've quoted for this year, I would expect the trend to continue to go up into next year. Now we are still well positioned relative peer group because we're able to borrow not only in the U.S., but also in euro, in pounds and in yen. So that keeps us very competitive. But nevertheless, we're not immune to those increases, so they will continue to go up into next year.\nJon Moeller: And just one piece of perspective there, Bryan. This is Jon. We've understandably, because it's been the primary driver of cost increases, focused our discussion on commodities. But that's not the only cost increase that we're seeing. We've just talked about interest expense. Andre mentioned in his prepared remarks, wages and benefits, which continue to increase. So, I would just encourage us all to gain confidence from what's happened here, but to realize that there are still, as Andre said, many headwinds that we're working against and we'll continue to work against as we move forward through next fiscal year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys, can you hear me?\nAndre Schulten: Yes, we can.\nDara Mohsenian: So, on the gross margin side, you were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter for the first time in a couple of years. Obviously, some nice sequential progress with the outsized cost savings and the strong pricing, but also your full year commodity assumptions and freight assumptions are a bit better than they were previously. So, just wanted to get a sense if we start to see this sustained improving gross margin environment, what's your perspective on the bias to sort of reinvest that upside back into marketing versus let it drop to the bottom-line? This quarter, obviously, with the magnitude of gross profit upside, you could do both. But just want to get a sense on how you think about that going forward? And if I can slip in a second part, are you comfortable you're getting a strong ROI on the higher ad spend? Presumably, obviously, you did this quarter, but how do you think about that going forward and sort of ROI on any spend that may be opportune or incremental to what you originally expected?\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Dara. We would expect progress on the gross margin side. Actually we're encouraged by the productivity numbers that have helped us on top of pricing to deliver the first modest increase in gross margin after a very long period of heavy cost headwinds impacting us to the negative side. And as we've done this quarter, we will continue to look for value creating opportunities to reinvest. We firmly believe the reason why we are able to grow the top-line at the range we are growing, the reason why we are able to hold volume share and value share globally in a very tough environment is because of our superiority-driven innovation across product, package, communication and retail execution. And we believe that as pricing goes into the market and the consumer is even more, I think, sensitive towards the value equation that they are being offered, continued investment across all of those vectors is going to create value and serve us well going forward. So, we will maintain the flexibility to do so, but we will do it in a disciplined and in a very ROI-driven way as you say. As to your second part of the question, as ad spending becomes more efficient with our ability to in-house both scheduling and buying of media, more digital capability to be more targeted, that increases the ROI of every dollar we can spend. So, it actually makes investment in media spending more attractive. At the end of the day, we will maintain the concept of balance between top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation to stick with our ongoing growth model and value creation model.\nJon Moeller: Just building on Andre's points, which I fully agree with, I want to come back to this notion of balance and our commitment to it. Some of you have heard me talk about this probably many times, but it's worth repeating, so you understand how we're thinking about things. We have a chart that we use with the leadership team every time we gather, which shows what you would have to believe to deliver top total share shareholder return, which is our objective entirely through the top-line or entirely through the bottom-line. And to do it entirely through the top-line, you'd have to assume that we can grow 8% from an organic sales standpoint each and every quarter, which is in our view unrealistic. If you try to do it entirely through the bottom-line, you'd have to assume that you could expand margins 180 basis points per year. So five years, 10 margin points in a highly competitive industry where it's taken us 187 years to build 22 margin points, equally unlikely. So, we are very committed to driving both top-line and bottom-line. It's the only way we see to get home. I have a trite little saying that we use on occasion, which is \"Top-line with no bottom-line, a waste of time. Bottom-line with no top-line, just a matter of time.\" We're going to continue to operate in that vein. And if we're successful, you'll see top-line growth driven by proper levels of investment and bottom-line growth and margin expansion -- modest margin expansion. One last thing on the point of advertising rate of return, or ROI, in addition to what Andre was talking about, we simply have, though maybe hard to believe, a lot of low-hanging fruit that's out there. We have many categories where we are not at our target levels of reach. And that's a very high ROI activity when we can reduce wasted frequency, reinvest that into expanded reach, very good things happen. As you've seen, by the way, not just this quarter, but for the last four years. And there's no reason to change that approach at this point in time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks, and good morning. So, overall volume this quarter came in roughly in line at least with our expectations, but both price and mix delivered upside, which I think implies just better structural elasticity than we were expecting. And I guess the question is, as you balance everything, just your relative confidence that, that can continue? On the one hand, you have some tailwinds for sure as China comes back and service levels seem to be improving, your reinvestment rate is admirable as we've been talking about. But there's obviously uncertainties out there. And so, I guess, maybe just a little bit of perspective on your overall confidence and where that confidence is more versus less elevated?\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Steve. I'll try a careful balance here between giving you perspective on the global basis and not letting you get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations. But the volume decline is better than we would have expected, as you said. Our elasticities remain favorable on an aggregate basis. And if you look at global markets, we actually see a volume consumption stabilizing. So, you would have seen in previous quarters global volumes across our categories down roughly 3 points to 4 points. In our most recent read, which is the past one month, volumes were actually down 70 basis points. This is market volume. And if you exclude Russia, probably more around flat. That's with China returning to some level of growth, and it's also with pricing moving into the base. So, we'll see as pricing becomes more annualized, we'll see that stabilization. I don't know if it's going to continue to be neutral. I would expect some level of negativity in terms of overall market volumes, but certainly improving sequentially. Within that, I think we're taking comfort in the fact that we are able to hold global volume share and global value share despite significant pricing that we have taken, which has enabled, as we said, we believe by our superiority strategy, a strong vertical portfolio, both tiers and price points and being present in all channels where consumers want to shop. In our biggest most important market, as we had in our prepared remarks, we were able to grow volume and volume share, 90 basis points over the past three months. So that's the positive side. On the negative side, Europe continues to be a high-pressure environment. We've been able to grow sales 8% in focus markets, but that it was a very strong pricing contribution with negative volumes in the range of 7%. And the European consumer is trading into private label. We see the price differential between private label and branded competitors increasing as private label is delaying price increases. The consumer continues to be under pressure there. So that's going to be a continued headwind, I think, from the volume side. Overall, I think our outlook is balanced. As we said, we expect market growth to return to 3% to 4% on the value side and there has to be a positive volume component to that going forward, but it will take a few quarters before we get there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on another strong set of results. I thought maybe we could spend a moment on China and the reopening there. Of course, given the importance of that market for you guys, being the second largest market behind only the U.S., so up 2% sequential improvement, which is encouraging, we see that in the China retail sales, including cosmetic continues to show sequential progress. You've been consistent about your target of mid-single digit growth for that market longer term. However, it also seems plausible that you potentially exceed that level of growth at least in the intermediate term here given easier year-over-year comps and then maybe the potential for some inventory rebalancing at retail as consumer demand improves. Can you comment a bit more on what you're seeing in China? And then, perhaps offer some broader views on the pace of the recovery, and how you see that playing out? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Hey, Kevin. This is Jon. I'll hand it over to Andre to give some more numerical perspective. But I thought it might help just to share briefly the trip that myself and a large contention of our leadership team were able to make to China in the last three weeks. We spent more than a week there. It was wonderful to reconnect with our organizations, who are doing a tremendous job. We spent time in consumer homes. We spent time with our retail partner leaders in their stores and in their offices. And of course, we spent time with various government authorities. And without getting into all the details, the bottom-line conclusion was a very positive one, and much more than I was expecting even, and I'm kind of a China fan having worked there many years ago and having lived there. So, my expectation has already started high and those were exceeded. Having said that, and we talked about this on the last call, this is not going to be a vertical restart. And there will be a number of twists and turns, including some of the ones that you've mentioned along the way. As Andre said in his prepared remarks, we expect China to continue to contribute at a meaningful level over the middle- to long-term. But everything looks reasonably positive and constructive. Andre, do you have any other perspective on that?\nAndre Schulten: No, I think you said it. I think the other component we're not yet seeing is any return of Chinese consumers to travel retail. That is a significant negative for us in the SK-II business specifically. So that, hopefully, we see a more positive trend there in the near future. That's the only other upside that I think we have. But as Jon said, I think the recovery at 2% organic sales in the quarter is very consistent with what we would have expected.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up on -- or clarification on some of the numbers and then my real question. So, the clarification is I think you mentioned that mix was a positive impact on sales, but it was a slight negative drag on the gross margins. Just like to understand that. And then, my focus question really is, if you go into more detail on the U.S. business and the U.S. consumer, you mentioned that you saw an improving U.S. consumer. So, any kind of clarification around that? And then, an update on your pricing in the U.S., how much you saw in the quarter? How much more is there to go in the next quarter? And any kind of impact that you're seeing, any granularity on that would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Robert. On the gross margin and sales connection here from mix perspective, the effect that you're seeing here is product mix. So, consumers when they come into our P&G portfolio, tend to trade up into higher-value items. We've seen that actually consistently over the past quarters. So that -- as they trade up into higher unit sales, that's a positive impact from a mix perspective on the top-line. But those higher unit sales items also have higher unit profit, but the gross margin in percentage is slightly lower for some of them. When you think about adult incontinence, for example, when you think about fabric care, single unit dose versus liquid detergent, gross margin percentage lower, unit sales higher, unit profit higher. So, it's a positive effect both from the top-line and the bottom-line standpoint, but the percentage mix is lower. U.S. consumer, I think is holding up well. As we said, any indication that we see on our business is that the consumer is still choosing P&G brands. We are growing volume share in a market that is still down on volume. We are growing absolute volume. So, 90 basis points value share goes, 40 basis points value share goes fairly consistently across periods. We also see private label shares stable at 16%, really no movement here over the past one, three, six, nine months, which is a good indication that we don't see any material trade down. Now we're watching this very closely. And we believe that a lot of that is again driven by our very intentional strategy to drive superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. We'll continue to invest in product packaging innovation. We're increasing, as Jon said, communication frequency and reach where we see a good payout and return. Continue to work with our retail partners to ensure that the presentation of our brands online and in-store is as good as it can be. Last element I would call out is we are stable in terms of supply and on-shelf availability, which is also helping our overall position in the market. So, stable, I think is the characterization, but we're watching carefully.\nJon Moeller: And just one additional point, the 6% top-line organic sales growth that the team delivered in the quarter, and as Andre said, sales share -- value share growth and volume share growth, we still have a couple of categories where we are not supplying full demand. That'll be remediated here fairly quickly. But as you as you consider the strength of the U.S. consumer, if you look at those key measures, and realize that there -- while there are both opportunities and risks within the number, there are opportunities as well as risks, which continue to point to a relatively healthy U.S. consumption pattern.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask about the changes in the commodity and freight outlook. Second straight quarter that these headwinds have moved lower, which is nice to see. Can you maybe just give a sense what you're seeing within that bucket? Where are costs moving lower? Where are costs still sticky? And while I don't expect you to comment on '24 at this point, but maybe just conceptually how you see inflation evolving as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Peter. Freight is relatively stable at this point in time, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks. We expect our freight and transportation and warehousing costs to be roughly in line with prior year. And I think that is a reflection of a more balanced capacity situation with a driver to load ratio returning to, I think, more historical norms. Again, given fuel prices and all other dynamics, I wouldn't expect any major change going forward, but we're at least stable. From a commodity basket standpoint, we continue to see a mixed bag. We have some help in resin-based commodities. We have some help in pulp, though that is moderated by mill shutdowns for maintenance, both planned and unplanned. But on the other side, all our high--energy usage materials, when you think about caustic soda, when you think about ammonia, all of those are increased in pricing. So, the moderation is really limited and it's not consistent across the basket. So, $100 million after tax is the only thing we're seeing at this point in time. We also continue to see upstream in the supply chain. Our suppliers continue to try to recover their input cost increases, their labor inflation, and that continues to be a discussion that is ongoing. I think as we mentioned in CAGNY, some of those contracts roll over 12 months, 18 months. So, there's -- these headwinds and these discussions will continue to be with us. Overall, we're expecting, as we always do, spot rates will hold on, that's what's based and underlying our planning for next year and our guidance for this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So, how should we think about the upside in Beauty? And both you Jon and Andre spoke briefly about travel retail being an upside in Asia. How should we be thinking also on the other side, lapping the triple pandemic and the respiratory benefit you had in healthcare? It seems you could benefit from digestive recently, but how should we be thinking about the other segments? And as we -- just a clarification. As we put in the embedded organic in the fourth quarter is a 4%. But it seems as if you are -- as Andre commented, the exit rate on your volume is potentially flat, bear in mind, of course, the potential risking in Europe. But should we be thinking more of a better quality in terms of the delivery in organic, so even though it would be a 300 basis points deceleration on a sequential basis, you'd still have better volumes, maybe flattish to maybe only slightly down and a 4% price component in there? Thank you so much.\nAndre Schulten: Hey, Andrea.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, Andre.\nAndre Schulten: On the category specific questions, yes, we see SK-II as potential beneficiary of travel retail reopening. Overall, SK-II is recovering well outside of that channel. In China, Mainland, we saw 8% growth in the quarter. In Japan, we saw 46% growth in the quarter. But the overall results are still held back by travel retail. So, I think, we will see a sequential improvement, but there are many gives and takes in the overall Beauty Care sector. So that needs to be seen in context with a lot of other dynamics that are going on around the world. On the Personal Health Care side, we continue to be very pleased with the results the team is delivering there. And we see sustained growth in this space across respiratory, digestive, nerve care. There are many parts of that portfolio that have very high growth potential. And in some of these areas as we've talked before, we're still held back by supply constraints, which might provide upside in the future. But again, we have a combination of 10 categories across multiple markets. Some of them will do well in a period of time, some of them will be held back by negative headwinds. So, we continue to strive for a balanced top- and bottom-line growth picture. It will be driven by different parts of the portfolio over different times. From a volume versus price component standpoint, what is important to understand is quarter four, we will start to lap price increases for the first time. So, we had about 8% of pricing in the base. So that will be a negative headwind to the top-line growth in quarter four. And while we see stabilization of volumes, I would expect that there still will be negative volume component to the growth in the near future. We have still Russia portfolio being with us as a negative headwind. China is slowly recovering, but not yet in positive territory from a volume perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, the European consumer is under a lot of pressure with private label pricing not yet following the branded competition in those markets. So, pricing will come into the base. That will be a headwind to the top-line. I would expect there's still a negative volume component in quarter four.\nJon Moeller: Yes. One thing to remember too is that we've just taken pricing in both the U.S. and Europe. And I don't think that the data for the current quarter reflects a potential volume impact from some of that pricing. So, I would be looking at volume recovery -- volume to slowly improve over time, but it won't happen overnight.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. Jon, clearly you've gone through a lot of transformation over the past five, six years that the company bought from a portfolio standpoint, organizational standpoint, superiority. Can you help us understand how you think internally these changes can help you navigate a potentially weaker consumer environment if what we're seeing in Europe were to extend into the U.S. and some other parts of the world? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Sure. And Andre may have some thoughts here as well. The -- what I really like about the strategic choices that we've made and the approach that we're taking currently is that it is the strongest approach I can think of. For a very healthy economic environment or a very difficult economic environment, the indicated actions don't change. So, think for example about our embedding in productivity as a fundamental part of our DNA. That's something that serves us very well. A positive economic environment as critical in a downward economic environment. The importance of superiority to consumers and categories where performance drives brand choice, critical in both a good economic environment and a difficult economic environment. Focus of the portfolio on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and superiority within each of those categories across product, package, communication, go-to-market and value for consumers and customers, I just -- I don't see anything in that, that I would change if we have -- I mean obviously, tactically, there'd be some different decisions on the margin, but the broad underlying approach sets us up very well even if or particularly if we end up in a more difficult environment.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on pricing, particularly on the new pricing, whether your view in terms of elasticities relative to previous rounds of pricing have -- whether they've changed or stay similar to what you've seen already. And to the extent that you can draw some conclusions on markets where pricing is now starting to lap versus markets where you're still rolling out price hikes, can you just compare and contrast what you're seeing, especially since you're starting to see some modest volume growth in the U.S.? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Olivia. The most recent round of pricing have gone into effect just in February and March across -- and I'm calling out across Europe and U.S., because [those are somewhat] (ph) visible. So, it's hard for us, as Jon said, to determine what the outgoing elasticities are at this point in time. What I can tell you is that elasticities remain stable, remain favorable. And I think it is also a function of continued investment. It is a function of continued innovation. Every price increase or most price increases are connected to innovation, meaningful innovation for the consumer, that also guarantees retail support. They are linked to strong value communication. We've talked about Ariel Coldwater, Tide Coldwater, Charmin rollback, Olay value communication. And that is meaningful for consumers as they come under pressure. Many of our categories are categories where a consumer doesn't want a risk failure. You don't want to wash your clothes twice and you certainly don't want to deal with a diaper failure. So, all of that I think is helping us to maintain favorable elasticities across the board. The most important insight for us is -- and that's what you see us do in Q3, we need to continue that investment. We need to look for opportunities where our value is exposed, and I'll call out Europe as an example because of private label pricing at a lower pace than the branded competitive set. It is critically important that we maintain that investment level to maintain the value equation. Where we see pricing lapping or I think where we have the strongest portfolio and the strongest execution in terms of innovation and superiority, we see favorable results, and the U.S. is a good example of that. Excellent in market execution by the team compared with a truly strong portfolio and strong innovation is delivering both relatively strong results to the balance of market, but also driving market growth recovery.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. Can you just talk about your playbook in Europe? You've noted European private label is delaying price increases a number of times on this call. We've heard similar commentary from others in Staples. If price gaps in private label remain wide, do you simply accept that new level? Or you need -- do you need to do something about it to be a bit more offensive to close the gap? And I guess I say that in the context of Europe, of course, but also as a -- bit of a litmus test for price competition that could play out globally in month and quarters ahead, and just how you think about managing through that type of dynamic? Thanks so much.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. I'll start, Chris, and then I'm sure Jon will add. I think, the team is accepting the reality of an extended or expanded price gap versus private label as the challenge they need to deal with. And as Jon frequently says, we wake up every Monday morning and deal with the reality in front of us. This is a reality we need to deal with. So, what that means is we need to create innovation. We need to create product and packaging innovation, communication strategies and in-market executions that are able to provide value to consumers and retailers. And that's what we're focused on. I don't think that trying to eliminate the price differential is a meaningful and helpful strategy for us. But if we can generate growth via innovation and via superiority, that's both helpful for us and the market and the path forward we're choosing.\nJon Moeller: I couldn't agree more. And frankly, while Andre rightly points to a difficult consumer environment, if you look at our results thus far in Europe, they're very encouraging, not just in the last quarter, but through last fiscal year as well. We're achieving growth rates in Europe that are higher than we've seen in a long time. And so, now is not the time to back off. It's time to move forward and strengthen the execution, just as Andre described. That doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand. We've made several adjustments to price gaps, not just versus private label, but versus branded competition as we've gone through this period of pricing, and we need to continue to be sensitive to that. But first and foremost, we need to delight consumers and customers with the offerings that we're bringing to market and go from there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for just letting me in, and congrats on strong results. A couple of quick questions. So, first on pricing. Can you give us some more quantification on perhaps breadth than magnitude? And when you blend it all together, what sort of order of magnitude should we expect at consolidated level in terms of organic sales contribution going forward? And then, secondly, SG&A, love to see the reinvestment back in the business. But really sharp sequential change both in terms of year-on-year for overall SG&A and just sequential dollar step up. Can you unpack a bit more kind of where the money is? What's -- where the extra investment is going?\nAndre Schulten: Yes, good morning, Jason. Pricing magnitude, the latest round of pricing is fairly consistent with what you would have seen in the past, but it's very tailored to the market as we said before. Mid-single digits, I think, is the ballpark I would give you for the latest increase. And I think pricing over time will move back to be a contributor to top-line, but not the sole contributor to top-line. So, we need -- and the market needs to find a balance here over the next few quarters to return to modest volume growth and pricing contribution to return these categories to mid-single digit growth. That's what we're working towards. On the SG&A line, look, a lot of our reinvestment is driven by innovation timing, so when are the right initiatives in market to double down on. They are driven by pricing timing. So, when do we and can we support our brands as we take pricing and drive innovation. What I would tell you is the latest push we had as a management team to our earlier discussion was to really double click on our sufficiency in Europe and to see how high is up, what -- how hard can we push, especially the media and communication side in terms of value communication across Europe. So that's the one area I will give you where we paid a lot of attention over the last three, four months.\nJon Moeller: I would just add one thing. It's our category leaders that determine the level of investment that we're making at any point in time. And prior to this quarter, just as you go back in time, there were more situations where we weren't able to fully supply demand. And, obviously, those are situations that you -- you continue to invest in mental awareness and --- but not spike that investment, because you can't supply it. And as we get into an increasingly better supply environment as we did in the last quarter, you resume a level of spending now that you can fully support it. So that's a part of the dynamic in addition to the dynamic that Andre described.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and good morning everyone. Wanted to ask sort of related two-part question more about U.S., but I suppose you could talk globally if relevant. How sticky do you think this strategy of irresistible superiority is in terms of volumes? Obviously, we see that you're gaining share if you look at the U.S. So, you're effectively trading consumers to higher-value products that work better than peer sets, right? So, it would suggest then there's a stickiness here that perhaps didn't exist in kind of prior cycles. So, I'd be curious how you think about that and how it flows through from a volume standpoint going forward? And related to that on just the volumes, what's your best guess as to why volumes are down from a consumer standpoint? Is the pantry destocking, unloading? Does that imply that they're potentially as reloading at a later time if and when consumer sentiment improves? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Hey, Mark. I'll take the first crack. I think the concept of irresistible superiority is: A, dynamic and must-be dynamic; and B, is relevant across value tiers. So, as consumers get more careful with their spending for example, that just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority and some of our lower value tiers means. So, if you think about diapers in the U.S. for example, we have Luvs, which is about half the price of a Swaddlers diaper. And that means that we need innovation on Luvs, because we're now competing with private label and we need to make sure as consumers look for value, that brand can stand on its own from a product, packaging, communication and retail execution standpoint to provide value to those consumers. So, it's really not a strategy that by default drives trade up. It's a strategy that follows the consumer and is grounded in what the consumer needs and wants over time, so if we get more stress, that just means we need to double click on the type of innovation and investment we need. From a consumption standpoint, as pricing goes into the market, we generally see consumers reacting with what you've described. If there are pantry inventories available, they, for a period of time, draw down those inventories. And recall coming out of the pandemic, I think Jon mentioned this earlier, there were increased pantry inventories available across multiple categories. So, I think that's part of the effect that we've seen. I wouldn't expect any major restocking, because I think we're just returning to our normal levels. As supply stabilizes, it's kind of the COVID pandemic goes more into the past, I think consumers return to their normal behaviors. The other element we're seeing is more careful usage. If you're overall made aware of inflation in everyday media, every day, you look twice before you use another paper towel et cetera. And partially, that's part of our value communication, right? When we talk about Charmin rollback because the product is more absorbent and has more strength, we explicitly talk about the ability for consumers to use less. So, it's really driven in those elements. Again, I think the job that we have as market leaders in many of our categories is to drive volume growth back to sustainable levels. And there's many levers. We still have huge household penetration opportunities around the world in many of our categories. We can create new usage occasions, create regimen use across many of our categories. Those are the things we're focused on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on China. Jon, maybe just given that you were there recently, just on the ground, consumer behavioral insights, like what are they going through right now? Are they just hesitating? And it's kind of like a choppy, \"Hey, maybe I'll check out, you know, outside and see if I get sick?\" I mean, just any perspective on kind of how the consumers actually behaving on the ground?\nJon Moeller: Yeah. You can imagine with what many of them have been through. There's a bit of a whiplash aspect to -- for three years, I was told that going outside was dangerous. And now I'm being encouraged to reemerge. I'm living probably in a relatively small dwelling, many times with multi-generations, and I don't want to negatively impact my family. So, there is a degree of hesitance and questioning. On the same time, there's an overwhelming feeling, at least as I experienced it, of liberation, of hope. And I was in Beijing one sunny Saturday afternoon, and the streets were packed. It was absolutely wonderful and joyous. So, I continue to hold on and believe in the mid- and long-term opportunities that China presents us with. It's certainly -- plus 2 is a lot better than a negative number that we had in the last couple of quarters. So there is clear improvement. But I think it'll be a little bit choppy. And all it will take is a little bit of nervousness to stop the reacceleration of the growth. But I would -- my takeaway, Nik, is a positive one, but with near-term caution.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Edward Lewis of Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yes. Thanks very much. I guess, I'll just cover a little bit of ground, but I'd be interested just on the enterprise market performance. Just looking in particular at Latin America, I think you said Andre somewhat 30% growth this quarter. And I think that'd be an acceleration around 20% in the first half. Assuming there's a healthy element of price behind that, but I'd just be interested here what's driving this improved performance in that region.\nAndre Schulten: There is a very healthy element of pricing there like in every other region, because we're pricing not only for commodities but also pricing for foreign exchange rate exposure in all of these markets. I think the positive effect is the volume is holding much better than in some of our focus markets. The consumer strength is there. I think the overall strength of the brands is better than we've ever seen. In-market execution is better than we've ever seen. Retail partnerships are better than we've ever seen. So, all of that I think is contributing to a strong price component with a positive volume component and that drives the 30% results of Latin America.\nJon Moeller: Yes. Just for perspective, in our two largest markets in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, as Andre is saying, we're seeing volumes high single digit. So, I don't want you to take away that all of the sales growth, as Andre has already said is pricing. It's a healthy combination. And I also need to give a nod to the team in Latin America who's just doing a fantastic job. Listen, I want to close-up with just a couple of comments and reflections. And the first relates to what we've been through and what I think it portends for the future. And then, I'll come in and talk a little bit more about the quarter that we just completed. But if we had a conversation three or four years ago, and you told me, \"Look, here's what's going to happen. We're going to have this thing called a global pandemic. People are going to die. Borders are going to be closed. You aren't going to be able to get to your largest markets and they aren't going to be able to get to you. You're going to have difficulty getting your colleagues into manufacturing facilities, innovation centers, sales offices. But don't worry, that's not all. We'll have the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The combination of foreign exchange and commodity cost inflation is going to wipe out half your earnings. You're going to see dramatic channel shift in some of your largest markets in terms of where consumers are doing their shopping. And when all that's over, you're going to find that it's difficult to get people to come back to work. How do you think you're going to do?\" And my answer to that three or four years ago would be that, \"Wow, do you think you can grow top-line, bottom-line, deliver cash and return that to shareholders through all that?\" Without taking you through the details, what you know very well, that's exactly what this team has done. Over the four years that ended last fiscal year, they created $13 billion in incremental sales, $5 billion in incremental profit. Now, if you bring that forward and look at what happened, what they accomplished in the last quarter, broad based sales growth, sequential progress in shipment volume, value share, volume share, return to gross margin expansion, strong productivity savings, at the same time healthy reinvestments in the top-line and advancing our level of superiority a margin of difference, in-market growth, in-household penetration, if those are the kinds of things our investors want to see, they're there in spades in the quarter that we just delivered. Last point, I promise, but we've talked several times, both Andre and I, about the challenges ahead, and they're real. We will continue trying our level best to do -- to serve consumers, customers, each other, society and clearly shareowners. But it's going to be, just as it has been, a bit choppy. And we're taking a long-term approach here. And if there are choices that are right for the long-term that cause bottom-line difficulty in the near--term, we're going to make those choices. And we'll talk more about that as we approach guidance for next year. But if you're thinking across mid and longer periods of time, I think we've got a great setup here, a great strategy, a great set of capabilities that should enable us to serve all those constituents that I mentioned very effectively. But we're thinking about that in years, not quarters. Thank you very much.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "I agree. And just one piece of perspective there, Bryan. This is Jon. We've understandably, because it's been the primary driver of cost increases, focused our discussion on commodities. But that's not the only cost increase that we're seeing. We've just talked about interest expense. Andre mentioned in his prepared remarks, wages and benefits, which continue to increase. So, I would just encourage us all to gain confidence from what's happened here, but to realize that there are still, as Andre said, many headwinds that we're working against and we'll continue to work against as we move forward through next fiscal year. Just building on Andre's points, which I fully agree with, I want to come back to this notion of balance and our commitment to it. Some of you have heard me talk about this probably many times, but it's worth repeating, so you understand how we're thinking about things. We have a chart that we use with the leadership team every time we gather, which shows what you would have to believe to deliver top total share shareholder return, which is our objective entirely through the top-line or entirely through the bottom-line. And to do it entirely through the top-line, you'd have to assume that we can grow 8% from an organic sales standpoint each and every quarter, which is in our view unrealistic. If you try to do it entirely through the bottom-line, you'd have to assume that you could expand margins 180 basis points per year. So five years, 10 margin points in a highly competitive industry where it's taken us 187 years to build 22 margin points, equally unlikely. So, we are very committed to driving both top-line and bottom-line. It's the only way we see to get home. I have a trite little saying that we use on occasion, which is \"Top-line with no bottom-line, a waste of time. Bottom-line with no top-line, just a matter of time.\" We're going to continue to operate in that vein. And if we're successful, you'll see top-line growth driven by proper levels of investment and bottom-line growth and margin expansion -- modest margin expansion. One last thing on the point of advertising rate of return, or ROI, in addition to what Andre was talking about, we simply have, though maybe hard to believe, a lot of low-hanging fruit that's out there. We have many categories where we are not at our target levels of reach. And that's a very high ROI activity when we can reduce wasted frequency, reinvest that into expanded reach, very good things happen. As you've seen, by the way, not just this quarter, but for the last four years. And there's no reason to change that approach at this point in time. Hey, Kevin. This is Jon. I'll hand it over to Andre to give some more numerical perspective. But I thought it might help just to share briefly the trip that myself and a large contention of our leadership team were able to make to China in the last three weeks. We spent more than a week there. It was wonderful to reconnect with our organizations, who are doing a tremendous job. We spent time in consumer homes. We spent time with our retail partner leaders in their stores and in their offices. And of course, we spent time with various government authorities. And without getting into all the details, the bottom-line conclusion was a very positive one, and much more than I was expecting even, and I'm kind of a China fan having worked there many years ago and having lived there. So, my expectation has already started high and those were exceeded. Having said that, and we talked about this on the last call, this is not going to be a vertical restart. And there will be a number of twists and turns, including some of the ones that you've mentioned along the way. As Andre said in his prepared remarks, we expect China to continue to contribute at a meaningful level over the middle- to long-term. But everything looks reasonably positive and constructive. Andre, do you have any other perspective on that? And just one additional point, the 6% top-line organic sales growth that the team delivered in the quarter, and as Andre said, sales share -- value share growth and volume share growth, we still have a couple of categories where we are not supplying full demand. That'll be remediated here fairly quickly. But as you as you consider the strength of the U.S. consumer, if you look at those key measures, and realize that there -- while there are both opportunities and risks within the number, there are opportunities as well as risks, which continue to point to a relatively healthy U.S. consumption pattern. Yes. One thing to remember too is that we've just taken pricing in both the U.S. and Europe. And I don't think that the data for the current quarter reflects a potential volume impact from some of that pricing. So, I would be looking at volume recovery -- volume to slowly improve over time, but it won't happen overnight. Sure. And Andre may have some thoughts here as well. The -- what I really like about the strategic choices that we've made and the approach that we're taking currently is that it is the strongest approach I can think of. For a very healthy economic environment or a very difficult economic environment, the indicated actions don't change. So, think for example about our embedding in productivity as a fundamental part of our DNA. That's something that serves us very well. A positive economic environment as critical in a downward economic environment. The importance of superiority to consumers and categories where performance drives brand choice, critical in both a good economic environment and a difficult economic environment. Focus of the portfolio on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and superiority within each of those categories across product, package, communication, go-to-market and value for consumers and customers, I just -- I don't see anything in that, that I would change if we have -- I mean obviously, tactically, there'd be some different decisions on the margin, but the broad underlying approach sets us up very well even if or particularly if we end up in a more difficult environment. I couldn't agree more. And frankly, while Andre rightly points to a difficult consumer environment, if you look at our results thus far in Europe, they're very encouraging, not just in the last quarter, but through last fiscal year as well. We're achieving growth rates in Europe that are higher than we've seen in a long time. And so, now is not the time to back off. It's time to move forward and strengthen the execution, just as Andre described. That doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand. We've made several adjustments to price gaps, not just versus private label, but versus branded competition as we've gone through this period of pricing, and we need to continue to be sensitive to that. But first and foremost, we need to delight consumers and customers with the offerings that we're bringing to market and go from there. I would just add one thing. It's our category leaders that determine the level of investment that we're making at any point in time. And prior to this quarter, just as you go back in time, there were more situations where we weren't able to fully supply demand. And, obviously, those are situations that you -- you continue to invest in mental awareness and --- but not spike that investment, because you can't supply it. And as we get into an increasingly better supply environment as we did in the last quarter, you resume a level of spending now that you can fully support it. So that's a part of the dynamic in addition to the dynamic that Andre described. Yeah. You can imagine with what many of them have been through. There's a bit of a whiplash aspect to -- for three years, I was told that going outside was dangerous. And now I'm being encouraged to reemerge. I'm living probably in a relatively small dwelling, many times with multi-generations, and I don't want to negatively impact my family. So, there is a degree of hesitance and questioning. On the same time, there's an overwhelming feeling, at least as I experienced it, of liberation, of hope. And I was in Beijing one sunny Saturday afternoon, and the streets were packed. It was absolutely wonderful and joyous. So, I continue to hold on and believe in the mid- and long-term opportunities that China presents us with. It's certainly -- plus 2 is a lot better than a negative number that we had in the last couple of quarters. So there is clear improvement. But I think it'll be a little bit choppy. And all it will take is a little bit of nervousness to stop the reacceleration of the growth. But I would -- my takeaway, Nik, is a positive one, but with near-term caution. Yes. Just for perspective, in our two largest markets in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, as Andre is saying, we're seeing volumes high single digit. So, I don't want you to take away that all of the sales growth, as Andre has already said is pricing. It's a healthy combination. And I also need to give a nod to the team in Latin America who's just doing a fantastic job. Listen, I want to close-up with just a couple of comments and reflections. And the first relates to what we've been through and what I think it portends for the future. And then, I'll come in and talk a little bit more about the quarter that we just completed. But if we had a conversation three or four years ago, and you told me, \"Look, here's what's going to happen. We're going to have this thing called a global pandemic. People are going to die. Borders are going to be closed. You aren't going to be able to get to your largest markets and they aren't going to be able to get to you. You're going to have difficulty getting your colleagues into manufacturing facilities, innovation centers, sales offices. But don't worry, that's not all. We'll have the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The combination of foreign exchange and commodity cost inflation is going to wipe out half your earnings. You're going to see dramatic channel shift in some of your largest markets in terms of where consumers are doing their shopping. And when all that's over, you're going to find that it's difficult to get people to come back to work. How do you think you're going to do?\" And my answer to that three or four years ago would be that, \"Wow, do you think you can grow top-line, bottom-line, deliver cash and return that to shareholders through all that?\" Without taking you through the details, what you know very well, that's exactly what this team has done. Over the four years that ended last fiscal year, they created $13 billion in incremental sales, $5 billion in incremental profit. Now, if you bring that forward and look at what happened, what they accomplished in the last quarter, broad based sales growth, sequential progress in shipment volume, value share, volume share, return to gross margin expansion, strong productivity savings, at the same time healthy reinvestments in the top-line and advancing our level of superiority a margin of difference, in-market growth, in-household penetration, if those are the kinds of things our investors want to see, they're there in spades in the quarter that we just delivered. Last point, I promise, but we've talked several times, both Andre and I, about the challenges ahead, and they're real. We will continue trying our level best to do -- to serve consumers, customers, each other, society and clearly shareowners. But it's going to be, just as it has been, a bit choppy. And we're taking a long-term approach here. And if there are choices that are right for the long-term that cause bottom-line difficulty in the near--term, we're going to make those choices. And we'll talk more about that as we approach guidance for next year. But if you're thinking across mid and longer periods of time, I think we've got a great setup here, a great strategy, a great set of capabilities that should enable us to serve all those constituents that I mentioned very effectively. But we're thinking about that in years, not quarters. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Mueller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories in -- and in six out of seven regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady, productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands. In-market execution across all five vectors of superiority is strong and consistent: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to shareowners, and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity. Moving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens, Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits, Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits, Baby Care was up mid singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles. Growth was also broad based across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe focus markets were up 8%. Greater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year, as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer-term, we expect China to return to mid singles underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories. Enterprise markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30% and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all five sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets. Global aggregate value share was in line with prior year, with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with eight of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year, driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year. Strong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants, as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the power wash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands. In Europe, the new four-chamber Ariel Platinum PODS are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care. Fairy Power Spray is growing the dish category and building market share in Home Care. The new GilletteLabs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in grooming. Moving to the bottom-line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points, as 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%. We returned $3.6 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top-line, bottom-line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value, we are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, extend margins and deliver strong cash generation, an approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. There are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies, they are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top- and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now, moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic. We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment, and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward. On the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient, with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supply inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months, but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year. Freight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after-tax, or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As noted in the outset, our strong results over the first three quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top-line growth we've averaged over the last four years, which were 5%, 6%, 6% and 7% from fiscal '19 through '22, respectively. On the bottom-line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations toward the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as we value -- as value creating opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics. We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. As we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Great. Good morning, Lauren. I think, as you said, we are catching up right now to return to gross savings levels that are equal or close to equal to those that we've delivered pre-COVID. We have more line capacity available for us to qualify cost savings or mind space of our teams to be able to identify new opportunities. And as we are able to engage suppliers and get through this inflationary period, hopefully, more ideation and new projects to be created as well. As we've talked on our Investor Day, we see runway on productivity for the next few years, driven by Supply Chain 3.0. We have talked about delivering about $1.5 billion of savings with those initiatives between automation and digital capabilities. And we continue to believe that we can generate between $400 million to $500 million a year from media, programmatic savings both in terms of scheduling and buying capabilities around the world. Those programs will hold productivity, in my estimation, close to pre-COVID levels, which will allow us to continue to reinvest in media, which will allow us to fund innovation and superiority, and that is really the intent of the model. So, to answer your question directly, I would not expect a disproportionate catch up, but I would expect a steady return to pre-COVID levels of net structure savings, both the cost and media. Yeah, morning, Bryan. Yes, I mean, obviously, it is, right? Markets are getting more expensive in terms of credit and we are not immune to that. So, the $125 million [BT] (ph) we've quoted for this year, I would expect the trend to continue to go up into next year. Now we are still well positioned relative peer group because we're able to borrow not only in the U.S., but also in euro, in pounds and in yen. So that keeps us very competitive. But nevertheless, we're not immune to those increases, so they will continue to go up into next year. Yes, we can. Good morning, Dara. We would expect progress on the gross margin side. Actually we're encouraged by the productivity numbers that have helped us on top of pricing to deliver the first modest increase in gross margin after a very long period of heavy cost headwinds impacting us to the negative side. And as we've done this quarter, we will continue to look for value creating opportunities to reinvest. We firmly believe the reason why we are able to grow the top-line at the range we are growing, the reason why we are able to hold volume share and value share globally in a very tough environment is because of our superiority-driven innovation across product, package, communication and retail execution. And we believe that as pricing goes into the market and the consumer is even more, I think, sensitive towards the value equation that they are being offered, continued investment across all of those vectors is going to create value and serve us well going forward. So, we will maintain the flexibility to do so, but we will do it in a disciplined and in a very ROI-driven way as you say. As to your second part of the question, as ad spending becomes more efficient with our ability to in-house both scheduling and buying of media, more digital capability to be more targeted, that increases the ROI of every dollar we can spend. So, it actually makes investment in media spending more attractive. At the end of the day, we will maintain the concept of balance between top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation to stick with our ongoing growth model and value creation model. Good morning, Steve. I'll try a careful balance here between giving you perspective on the global basis and not letting you get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations. But the volume decline is better than we would have expected, as you said. Our elasticities remain favorable on an aggregate basis. And if you look at global markets, we actually see a volume consumption stabilizing. So, you would have seen in previous quarters global volumes across our categories down roughly 3 points to 4 points. In our most recent read, which is the past one month, volumes were actually down 70 basis points. This is market volume. And if you exclude Russia, probably more around flat. That's with China returning to some level of growth, and it's also with pricing moving into the base. So, we'll see as pricing becomes more annualized, we'll see that stabilization. I don't know if it's going to continue to be neutral. I would expect some level of negativity in terms of overall market volumes, but certainly improving sequentially. Within that, I think we're taking comfort in the fact that we are able to hold global volume share and global value share despite significant pricing that we have taken, which has enabled, as we said, we believe by our superiority strategy, a strong vertical portfolio, both tiers and price points and being present in all channels where consumers want to shop. In our biggest most important market, as we had in our prepared remarks, we were able to grow volume and volume share, 90 basis points over the past three months. So that's the positive side. On the negative side, Europe continues to be a high-pressure environment. We've been able to grow sales 8% in focus markets, but that it was a very strong pricing contribution with negative volumes in the range of 7%. And the European consumer is trading into private label. We see the price differential between private label and branded competitors increasing as private label is delaying price increases. The consumer continues to be under pressure there. So that's going to be a continued headwind, I think, from the volume side. Overall, I think our outlook is balanced. As we said, we expect market growth to return to 3% to 4% on the value side and there has to be a positive volume component to that going forward, but it will take a few quarters before we get there. No, I think you said it. I think the other component we're not yet seeing is any return of Chinese consumers to travel retail. That is a significant negative for us in the SK-II business specifically. So that, hopefully, we see a more positive trend there in the near future. That's the only other upside that I think we have. But as Jon said, I think the recovery at 2% organic sales in the quarter is very consistent with what we would have expected. Good morning, Robert. On the gross margin and sales connection here from mix perspective, the effect that you're seeing here is product mix. So, consumers when they come into our P&G portfolio, tend to trade up into higher-value items. We've seen that actually consistently over the past quarters. So that -- as they trade up into higher unit sales, that's a positive impact from a mix perspective on the top-line. But those higher unit sales items also have higher unit profit, but the gross margin in percentage is slightly lower for some of them. When you think about adult incontinence, for example, when you think about fabric care, single unit dose versus liquid detergent, gross margin percentage lower, unit sales higher, unit profit higher. So, it's a positive effect both from the top-line and the bottom-line standpoint, but the percentage mix is lower. U.S. consumer, I think is holding up well. As we said, any indication that we see on our business is that the consumer is still choosing P&G brands. We are growing volume share in a market that is still down on volume. We are growing absolute volume. So, 90 basis points value share goes, 40 basis points value share goes fairly consistently across periods. We also see private label shares stable at 16%, really no movement here over the past one, three, six, nine months, which is a good indication that we don't see any material trade down. Now we're watching this very closely. And we believe that a lot of that is again driven by our very intentional strategy to drive superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. We'll continue to invest in product packaging innovation. We're increasing, as Jon said, communication frequency and reach where we see a good payout and return. Continue to work with our retail partners to ensure that the presentation of our brands online and in-store is as good as it can be. Last element I would call out is we are stable in terms of supply and on-shelf availability, which is also helping our overall position in the market. So, stable, I think is the characterization, but we're watching carefully. Good morning, Peter. Freight is relatively stable at this point in time, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks. We expect our freight and transportation and warehousing costs to be roughly in line with prior year. And I think that is a reflection of a more balanced capacity situation with a driver to load ratio returning to, I think, more historical norms. Again, given fuel prices and all other dynamics, I wouldn't expect any major change going forward, but we're at least stable. From a commodity basket standpoint, we continue to see a mixed bag. We have some help in resin-based commodities. We have some help in pulp, though that is moderated by mill shutdowns for maintenance, both planned and unplanned. But on the other side, all our high--energy usage materials, when you think about caustic soda, when you think about ammonia, all of those are increased in pricing. So, the moderation is really limited and it's not consistent across the basket. So, $100 million after tax is the only thing we're seeing at this point in time. We also continue to see upstream in the supply chain. Our suppliers continue to try to recover their input cost increases, their labor inflation, and that continues to be a discussion that is ongoing. I think as we mentioned in CAGNY, some of those contracts roll over 12 months, 18 months. So, there's -- these headwinds and these discussions will continue to be with us. Overall, we're expecting, as we always do, spot rates will hold on, that's what's based and underlying our planning for next year and our guidance for this year. Hey, Andrea. On the category specific questions, yes, we see SK-II as potential beneficiary of travel retail reopening. Overall, SK-II is recovering well outside of that channel. In China, Mainland, we saw 8% growth in the quarter. In Japan, we saw 46% growth in the quarter. But the overall results are still held back by travel retail. So, I think, we will see a sequential improvement, but there are many gives and takes in the overall Beauty Care sector. So that needs to be seen in context with a lot of other dynamics that are going on around the world. On the Personal Health Care side, we continue to be very pleased with the results the team is delivering there. And we see sustained growth in this space across respiratory, digestive, nerve care. There are many parts of that portfolio that have very high growth potential. And in some of these areas as we've talked before, we're still held back by supply constraints, which might provide upside in the future. But again, we have a combination of 10 categories across multiple markets. Some of them will do well in a period of time, some of them will be held back by negative headwinds. So, we continue to strive for a balanced top- and bottom-line growth picture. It will be driven by different parts of the portfolio over different times. From a volume versus price component standpoint, what is important to understand is quarter four, we will start to lap price increases for the first time. So, we had about 8% of pricing in the base. So that will be a negative headwind to the top-line growth in quarter four. And while we see stabilization of volumes, I would expect that there still will be negative volume component to the growth in the near future. We have still Russia portfolio being with us as a negative headwind. China is slowly recovering, but not yet in positive territory from a volume perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, the European consumer is under a lot of pressure with private label pricing not yet following the branded competition in those markets. So, pricing will come into the base. That will be a headwind to the top-line. I would expect there's still a negative volume component in quarter four. Good morning, Olivia. The most recent round of pricing have gone into effect just in February and March across -- and I'm calling out across Europe and U.S., because [those are somewhat] (ph) visible. So, it's hard for us, as Jon said, to determine what the outgoing elasticities are at this point in time. What I can tell you is that elasticities remain stable, remain favorable. And I think it is also a function of continued investment. It is a function of continued innovation. Every price increase or most price increases are connected to innovation, meaningful innovation for the consumer, that also guarantees retail support. They are linked to strong value communication. We've talked about Ariel Coldwater, Tide Coldwater, Charmin rollback, Olay value communication. And that is meaningful for consumers as they come under pressure. Many of our categories are categories where a consumer doesn't want a risk failure. You don't want to wash your clothes twice and you certainly don't want to deal with a diaper failure. So, all of that I think is helping us to maintain favorable elasticities across the board. The most important insight for us is -- and that's what you see us do in Q3, we need to continue that investment. We need to look for opportunities where our value is exposed, and I'll call out Europe as an example because of private label pricing at a lower pace than the branded competitive set. It is critically important that we maintain that investment level to maintain the value equation. Where we see pricing lapping or I think where we have the strongest portfolio and the strongest execution in terms of innovation and superiority, we see favorable results, and the U.S. is a good example of that. Excellent in market execution by the team compared with a truly strong portfolio and strong innovation is delivering both relatively strong results to the balance of market, but also driving market growth recovery. Yeah. I'll start, Chris, and then I'm sure Jon will add. I think, the team is accepting the reality of an extended or expanded price gap versus private label as the challenge they need to deal with. And as Jon frequently says, we wake up every Monday morning and deal with the reality in front of us. This is a reality we need to deal with. So, what that means is we need to create innovation. We need to create product and packaging innovation, communication strategies and in-market executions that are able to provide value to consumers and retailers. And that's what we're focused on. I don't think that trying to eliminate the price differential is a meaningful and helpful strategy for us. But if we can generate growth via innovation and via superiority, that's both helpful for us and the market and the path forward we're choosing. Yes, good morning, Jason. Pricing magnitude, the latest round of pricing is fairly consistent with what you would have seen in the past, but it's very tailored to the market as we said before. Mid-single digits, I think, is the ballpark I would give you for the latest increase. And I think pricing over time will move back to be a contributor to top-line, but not the sole contributor to top-line. So, we need -- and the market needs to find a balance here over the next few quarters to return to modest volume growth and pricing contribution to return these categories to mid-single digit growth. That's what we're working towards. On the SG&A line, look, a lot of our reinvestment is driven by innovation timing, so when are the right initiatives in market to double down on. They are driven by pricing timing. So, when do we and can we support our brands as we take pricing and drive innovation. What I would tell you is the latest push we had as a management team to our earlier discussion was to really double click on our sufficiency in Europe and to see how high is up, what -- how hard can we push, especially the media and communication side in terms of value communication across Europe. So that's the one area I will give you where we paid a lot of attention over the last three, four months. Hey, Mark. I'll take the first crack. I think the concept of irresistible superiority is: A, dynamic and must-be dynamic; and B, is relevant across value tiers. So, as consumers get more careful with their spending for example, that just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority and some of our lower value tiers means. So, if you think about diapers in the U.S. for example, we have Luvs, which is about half the price of a Swaddlers diaper. And that means that we need innovation on Luvs, because we're now competing with private label and we need to make sure as consumers look for value, that brand can stand on its own from a product, packaging, communication and retail execution standpoint to provide value to those consumers. So, it's really not a strategy that by default drives trade up. It's a strategy that follows the consumer and is grounded in what the consumer needs and wants over time, so if we get more stress, that just means we need to double click on the type of innovation and investment we need. From a consumption standpoint, as pricing goes into the market, we generally see consumers reacting with what you've described. If there are pantry inventories available, they, for a period of time, draw down those inventories. And recall coming out of the pandemic, I think Jon mentioned this earlier, there were increased pantry inventories available across multiple categories. So, I think that's part of the effect that we've seen. I wouldn't expect any major restocking, because I think we're just returning to our normal levels. As supply stabilizes, it's kind of the COVID pandemic goes more into the past, I think consumers return to their normal behaviors. The other element we're seeing is more careful usage. If you're overall made aware of inflation in everyday media, every day, you look twice before you use another paper towel et cetera. And partially, that's part of our value communication, right? When we talk about Charmin rollback because the product is more absorbent and has more strength, we explicitly talk about the ability for consumers to use less. So, it's really driven in those elements. Again, I think the job that we have as market leaders in many of our categories is to drive volume growth back to sustainable levels. And there's many levers. We still have huge household penetration opportunities around the world in many of our categories. We can create new usage occasions, create regimen use across many of our categories. Those are the things we're focused on. There is a very healthy element of pricing there like in every other region, because we're pricing not only for commodities but also pricing for foreign exchange rate exposure in all of these markets. I think the positive effect is the volume is holding much better than in some of our focus markets. The consumer strength is there. I think the overall strength of the brands is better than we've ever seen. In-market execution is better than we've ever seen. Retail partnerships are better than we've ever seen. So, all of that I think is contributing to a strong price component with a positive volume component and that drives the 30% results of Latin America. Thanks, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.  As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten : Good morning. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions.  Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the October to December quarter, growing organic sales in nine of 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, continued productivity savings, improving supply efficiency, sustained investment and superiority of our brands across all five vectors: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value, continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn, for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan fiscal year-to-date enables us to increase the guidance range for organic sales growth and maintain ranges for core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners.  Moving to the second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 5%, pricing at a 10 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 6 points driven by a combination of market contraction, trade inventory reductions and portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens, Feminine Care, Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Hair Care was up mid-single digits. Baby Care, Family Care, Oral Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up low single digits. Grooming was in line with prior year. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 6%. Greater China organic sales were down 7% versus prior year, as the market continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns and weaker consumer confidence. We continue to expect a slow recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Long term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 14% with each of the three regions up 10% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing share. U.S. volume share is up 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter, delivering sequential improvement from quarter one.  Recent innovations like Downy Rinse and Refresh in fabric enhancers and Dawn Powerwash in hand dishwashing are extending superiority advantages and driving value and volume share growth. Innovation also serves as a catalyst for pricing across our other brands and forms in their category segments. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.59, down 4% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 5%. Core operating margin decreased 170 basis points, primarily due to gross margin pressure from commodities and foreign exchange. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 70 basis points. Productivity improvements were 110 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 72%, primarily due to a temporary reduction in payables. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, continued solid results across the top line, bottom line and cash for the first half of the fiscal year. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. As discussed during our Investor Day in November, we are renewing our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly reporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies, Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value creation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. We expanded on each of these at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend or listen in remotely, I encourage you to review the materials on our IR events website. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with commitment to deliver irresistible superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now moving to guidance. We continue to expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and pack material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation are still a significant headwind versus last fiscal year, though we have seen some modest sequential improvement. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind. But like raw and pack materials, we've seen modest directional improvement. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.2 billion after-tax impact for the fiscal year. Freight costs remain higher versus prior year, and we continue to expect the $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.7 billion after tax, $1.50 per share, a 26 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. For perspective, recall that we began the year expecting approximately $1.33 of cost and FX headwinds. So despite some modest relief since last quarter, our current outlook is still $0.17 worse than our ingoing position. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As we've said before, we believe this is a bottom line rough patch to grow through with continued investment in the business and underlying strategies. As I noted at the outset, our solid first half results enable us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 4% to 5%. Within this company-wide range, we -- there are many puts and takes. As I mentioned, we expect to see some modest improvement in China, but European markets have softened as high inflation affects consumer spending. The U.S. remains relatively strong to date, and most enterprise markets remain resilient. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. The significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion of dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, we continue to face high year-over-year commodity and transportation cost inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. These macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. We attempt to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward towards our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We are committed to driving productivity, improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth.  With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian : So just a couple of questions on the full year guidance. Obviously, you didn't change the earnings guidance despite FX and commodities each being a little less negative than you originally thought. Is that more sort of making up for some of the sequential moves that we saw in Q1? Is it more you assuming reinvestment in the back half? Or is there something else in the back half? Just help us understand the reasoning there.  And basically, the same question on top line. I don't want to get into a 10-part question, but there's a bunch of sort of back and forth here. You raised the low end of the full year org sales range, but Q2 decelerated a bit versus Q1, the back half in theory implies a deceleration and volumes were a little weaker in the quarter. So maybe just taking a step back, how do you feel about the business in terms of looking at retail takeaway in fiscal Q2 and thoughts on the back half of the year?\nAndre Schulten : All right. I'll give it a try, Dara. So on the total year forecast, I think with half one results in, we are on track, very well on track to deliver the year and the guidance ranges that we're communicating. When you look at our EPS delivery for the balance of the year, we are assuming, as we always do, current spot rates on commodities and foreign exchange. And given our desire to reinvest, we would not assume that every dollar that we see in commodities and foreign exchange immediately flows through to the bottom line. We see significant upside for us to continue to invest in superiority across all five vectors. And if that upside is available to us, we will do that in the short term and the midterm. We have -- also, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are still above ingoing assumptions. So $0.17 worse than we had at the time when we provided the initial guidance. So that leads us to continue to be pointed towards the lower end of the core EPS range. But as you say, with more help coming, that probably is increasing our confidence to deliver that range or hopefully slightly better.  On the top line, again, when we look at the half one results, we feel very good about our standing here to deliver a higher -- the higher end of our initial top line guidance. So that's why we raised to 4% to 5% organic sales growth. And the fact that we see low volumes in the current quarter really is important to understand in more depth. So the 6% or 5.8% negative volume on the quarter, when you dissect it about half of that is not really consumption driven. So we have 1 point related to our portfolio choice in Russia, where we cut the portfolio by 50% to focus on essentials versus the full portfolio we were operating before. We have about 2 points related to temporary inventory reductions, which we saw in China with the market heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns and O&D. And especially on the offline side of the market, we see retailer inventories reduce reserve cash. We saw some inventory reduction in power Oral Care and Appliances in Europe. And we have seen in late December, very strong consumption in the U.S., where retail orders haven't quite kept up with that consumption. So if you strip that out, the actual consumption-related volume decline is about 3% on the quarter, which is in line with what we've seen in quarter one, which is in line with our expectation and elasticities that we would have expected, given the amount of pricing that is in the market. What is encouraging to us to raise the top line guidance is that our volume shares are holding globally, our value shares are holding globally. And when we look at the U.S., our biggest and most important markets, we actually see an acceleration of volume share by 50 basis points over the past three months and even 80 basis points over the past one month. Again, all of that gives us confidence to raise the top line guidance while we want to preserve the flexibility to continue to invest in superiority to drive more sustainable growth. And honestly, that's going to be our job here over the next few quarters, continue to drive household penetration to reinvigorate overall volume growth in the category.\nJon Moeller : Dara, this is Jon. I would just add a couple of pieces of perspective at a macro level. The world seems to want everything to be better as do I. That's really not reality though. There's an incredible amount of uncertainty that remains. None of us, I think, globally really understand what the recovery rate in China is going to be as an example. And nobody really understands what the new policies and practices are going to mean in terms of consumer confidence in that context. You have the war in Eastern Europe. You have the highest inflation rates in 40 years. You have continued volatility in both the currency markets and the commodity markets. And importantly, that currency exposure for us is not a simple dollar exposure. There's a lot of cross rate exposures within that, which I realize makes it difficult to penetrate. But for example, the cross rate between the British pound and the euro has a significant impact on our bottom line.  So all that put together, while I'm extremely happy with the progress the organization is making I'm extremely confident that the strategy that we have is the right one that's going to continue to serve us well. It's just not an easy time to be taking up guidance to the top range of possibility.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman : You covered a lot in that answer. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit and maybe talk about capacity investments. I think one of the big drag to gross margin this quarter was this capacity investments. I know there have been some particular areas like Fem Care, Oral is a big focus. So if you could talk a little bit maybe about anything -- Fem Care, beyond Fem Care where you're putting incremental capacity in to what degree you expect that to remain a drag to profitability over the next couple of quarters? Or is it a multiple year dynamic? Because that would also speak to some pretty healthy expectations around longer-term volume trends. And I think that's particularly relevant also as we look a little bit beyond the next quarter or two.\nAndre Schulten : Yes, Lauren. We are -- the short-term effect that we are describing here is indeed Fem Care related. We see on the top end of the portfolio, very strong growth. We have seen very strong growth over the past two years. And we are just need to catch up in terms of overall capacity to demand ratio, both on the top end of our pads business, which is the Radiant or Infinity business. And as you well know, we're still not up to full demand levels on tampons, which we will install -- are in the process of installing new capacity in the back half. The investments across businesses to catch up to the very significant increase in terms of business size is underway. So we have capacity investments across most businesses. I wouldn't expect it to be a significant drag on the bottom line. In fact, the growth that we anticipate will more than outweigh the cost of investing in capacity, and that's the plan, obviously. So we have high confidence in our growth potential and that's really what's triggering these capacity investments. Just in the U.S., for example, the last quarter was the first quarter we've reached $40 billion in sales, up from $30 billion in sales just four years ago. So -- and again, our growth rate continues to look very positive. Volume shares are up and better than the market, our volumes are trending to positive numbers year-over-year. So we need to keep up with that. The net of it is all positive.\nJon Moeller : Yes. Just one quick clarification there. The $40 billion that Andre is referring to is a annualized run rate number. So it was $10 billion in the quarter, which translates to $40 billion, [Indiscernible] 4, just so people don't get too carried away. \nAndre Schulten: Fair enough. \nJon Moeller: Lauren, the point that you made and the point Andre made, there's a lot of upside here as we bring this capacity online. We indicated we're not meeting full demand in some of the protection segments. We have opportunity, as you said, across the board. So we're investing pretty significantly. I think as he said and you've said the bigger impact will be in our ability to accelerate the top line. It should not be a significant bottom line drag.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : I just -- I had one clarification and one question. The clarification, just I think in response to Dara's question, you cited 3-point hit the volume from basically Russia and shipping behind consumption. So if we add that back, organic sales would have been closer to an 8 versus a 5. I just want to make sure that, that was the way we should be thinking about it?\nAndre Schulten : That's correct.\nBryan Spillane : Okay. And then as we look into the back half of the year, I guess, just if you could comment on two things. One is, has anything changed in terms of your view of the macro setup? So just as the operating environment the same, better or worse than what you were expecting? And then also, just would we expect maybe to rebuild some of the inventory, the under shipment that occurred in the second quarter or the first half, would we get any of that back in the second half?\nAndre Schulten : I would say the operating environment continues to be difficult, and we expect it to be difficult in the second half. While I think the U.S. is holding up very well. Enterprise markets are holding up very well. As John said earlier, recovery in China will be very hard to predict and probably not a straight line. We expect China to be difficult in the second half as it was in the first half. The European markets will continue to have to work through very high inflation numbers I think we've seen a little bit of help via a warmer winter season that has helped energy prices. But Europe is not through, I think, inflationary pressures and consumers are still to see many of the consequences in terms of the eating builds as we are entering February and March. That doesn't change anything we do. I think the best way for us to get through all of this is to continue to invest in the business and to continue to execute with excellence, which the organization is doing and which is driving these good results. Our ability to carefully balance pricing and productivity to offset the inflationary pressures is critical. Within pricing, careful execution and combining pricing with innovation and sufficient investment to drive superiority of our brands is critical. So that's why we want to preserve some level of flexibility to do those investments as we get through the second half.\nJon Moeller : And just a little bit of color on the inventory piece, which has been accurately described a couple of times here. This is a fairly simple dynamic that's occurring. When there is supply volatility and uncertainty, it causes retailers to build higher inventory levels. When there's demand volatility, it does the same. So we've been through a period where inventories have been a little bit higher than normal in some of our retail channels. Supply assurance is increasing, demand volatility is decreasing. So those inventories are understandably being brought down. And so Bryan, I don't expect that there's a significant swing here quarter-to-quarter. I think this is the system normalizing itself.\nAndre Schulten : Yes. I think Jon is exactly right. Our on-shelf availability is getting better. We're up now to 95% on-shelf availability, up from 93%. We make sequential progress. So as the supply chain is stabilizing, I wouldn't expect immediate return of those days on hand. I think some of it will come back, but it will take a longer period of time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers : I wanted to go back just to the topic of reinvestment for a minute. It was a big topic last quarter, and I think you convinced us then and through your commentary at Investor Day that you were actually pretty fully invested in your prior outlook enabled by productivity. So as you think about the reinvestment that you're implying incrementally in the new outlook. I'm just -- is that -- should we interpret that as elective and opportunistic for kind of greater medium-term returns? Or is it more necessary in the near term given more concerning consumer competitive realists? Just how you'd frame that reinvestment would be helpful. And then if you could also just -- you talked about strength in the enterprise markets, your resilience. Just if there are any pockets of particular strength you could call out, that would be great. And any areas where you're more watchful, that would also be helpful?\nAndre Schulten : I would characterize our current media spending and support spending for our brands as sufficient, which we are paying a lot of attention with each of the businesses. John pays a lot of attention with each of the businesses to ensure that is the case. And sufficiency is defined as sufficient reach, sufficient frequency. It's not defined as dollars spent. So again, I want to come back to the fact that, yes, we view the current business as fully funded, sufficiently funded in order to continue growing our brands, their top-of-mind awareness and their equity. When we reinvest because there is a positive return in the short term, and we can further strengthen our brands or specific innovation that is out there. In the most recent quarter, for example, we've increased quarter-over-quarter, our total ad spend by $140 million. And that is a function of innovation timing. It's also a function of merchandising support and core timing advertising with that retailer support. So we -- you see us adhere to that principle of fully supporting our brands if there are opportunities to create short-term ROI, will continue to double down.\nJon Moeller : And one other opportunity that we've talked about a little bit this morning, as additional supply comes online, there are often opportunities to increase support for the business to take advantage of that additional capacity. So we'll be looking for those, as Andre said, positive ROI opportunities to drive the business.  You asked about enterprise markets. When you get down to a country level, of course, it's very variable. But 14% growth on the top line, all three regions growing at over 10%. So the strength is pretty broad there.\nAndre Schulten : Yes. And if you look at L.A., 21% growth, for example, so that will be the top end of the growth and fairly consistent here. So enterprise markets continue to deliver very strong results.  Last point maybe on the media investment. The synergies we're able to create are a real and not insignificant. So if you look at Baby Care, for example, that business has grown 10% last year. They have completely shifted the way they run their media. They've increased reach by 20%, increased top-of-mind awareness by 26%. All of that while they saved 15% of their media spend. So the equation here really allows for sufficiency at lower cost.\nJon Moeller : And that, again, just for clarity, is a U.S. dynamic that Andre has just described, the 10% growth. And I'll leave it there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong : Great. If memory serves me right, much of the pricing actions from last year will start to lap in the March quarter. So in your view, is the December quarter the one that has the biggest spread between price and volume? And could you talk about where your elasticity stand relative to historical view? And if -- and how price and volume tracked at the end of the quarter versus the minus 6 versus plus 10 average for the quarter.\nAndre Schulten : Hey, Olivia. The -- let me start with elasticities. The overall view has not changed. We continue to see more favorable elasticities than we would have expected on historical data pretty much everywhere, but Europe focused markets. And you can see with 10% pricing flowing through. And when you strip out the non-consumption-related volume effect, a 3% reduction in volume, that is a very benign elasticity that we're seeing in aggregate and allows us to hold volume share and value share as the pricing flows through. So we feel good about, again, the strategy, doing what we wanted to do and the execution being very diligent in each of the markets. Europe is the one place where elasticities have returned to what we would have expected more on historical data, and that is driven by the increased pressure on the consumer. We're also seeing a little bit of price lag here. So private label, for example, is pricing slower in Europe, and that increases temporarily the price gap versus private label. Nothing we didn't plan on, but that explains part of the higher elasticities. In terms of peak pricing, you're right, many of the large price increases get left this fiscal year. But that doesn't mean that we're not putting more pricing in the market. So for example, we have a number of price increases that go into effect in February. So there's two components here. One where lapping price increases were executed last year, but we're also still passing through some of the cost pressures via incremental pricing around the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey : I just wanted to come back to Steve's question on investment priorities. If I take your fiscal year outlook, you're clearly implying better margins in the back half of the year. But if I just walk through a gross margin bridge of what perhaps makes sense, it does seem to imply you'll need to see leverage on the SG&A line in the back half of the year to drive margin expansion potentially notable SG&A leverage despite sales decelerating. So again, if you could just help me frame overall SG&A and whether you think you'll be ending the year with appropriate levels of spending? Or if you expect investments to maybe grow progressively over the next 12 to 18 months as, for example, your capacity continues to improve, as Jon just said.\nAndre Schulten : I wouldn't expect a structural shift in SG&A spend. I think what you're seeing in the run rate is about what we expect to need in order to be sufficiently funded and the gross margin -- and most of the margin expansion will come from gross margin expansion as we ramp up productivity, pricing continues to flow through and that builds gross margin period-over-period. So that will be the bigger contributor. And we're not counting on any major reductions in SG&A beyond what productivity allows us to deliver again, at current sufficiency levels, and we are very carefully looking at what can we reinvest actually and still deliver within the range that we want to deliver.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. \nKaumil Gajrawala : Good morning. Your commentary, I guess, just now on taking further pricing, it's obviously appropriate given we have a series of costs that are still coming through. But can you maybe just talk a little bit about the response from retailers and is that changing in any way? Not that long ago, it seemed across all of CPG, it was maybe easier to get some pricing through. And I'm just curious if that's changing in any way.\nAndre Schulten : Yes, Kaumil. The environment continues to be constructive. We don't see much change in retailer conversations. It's focused on how do we best play the role that we need to play as a category leader in many of the markets by combining pricing with innovation, executing pricing in a way that consumers can appropriately choose from different price points, different value tiers. And how that plays out at retail shelf, both virtual and physical shelves in the best possible way, so we can help them grow their category grow foot traffic, et cetera. Those are really the majority of the conversations I would characterize this quarter or next quarter as any different than the previous quarters, where really it's about how do we do this, when is the best time to execute. It's not should we or must we take pricing. I think everybody still understands that we are recovering costs after we recover as much as we can with productivity.\nJon Moeller : And as Andre said, the conversation, much more constructive for all concerned when we focus on improving consumer value holistically defined. And that's exactly what Andre was talking about in terms of the combination of innovation and pricing. And when that's the conversation, it takes on a very different nature than a more transactional discussion. Also don't forget, our retail partners are the owners of the private label brands that we compete against. They're facing many of the same dynamics in terms of their cost inputs that we are. So just to reconfirm what Andre said, it's been a generally constructive discussion. I don't see anything in my interactions with our retail partners that causes an inflection in that discussion in the near term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein : Just first a quick follow-up and then my main question. So one, in terms of follow-up, is the volume headwind in this quarter from Russia and sort of the one-offs? Is that just a quarter issue? Or is that going to linger on the following quarters? And then my primary focus is the market share data that you gave us in terms of the U.S., I think, was very impressive, particularly given some of the lingering supply issues that are going to be resolved soon. So can we expect perhaps accelerating improvement in market share as the year goes the supply comes on and maybe give us a little bit more sense of what the drivers were for the encouraging market share momentum in the U.S.?\nAndre Schulten : Yes. Robert, on the volume side, I think the Russia effect will be with us for one more quarter before we annualize. And on the inventory side, as we said before, we believe this was a onetime adjustment. I wouldn't expect this to come back immediately. I wouldn't expect a significant further reduction in inventory. When we look at the U.S., for example, where we have good data in terms of retailer days on hand, we believe we are at pre-COVID levels, which is about the level that we've proven to operate reliably with our retail partners. So I would expect that to be a one-timer with potentially some help coming in back over the next few quarters.  The volume share dynamic in the U.S. is driven largely by Fabric Care coming back into supply. We have talked in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and also in the first quarter of this fiscal year, that we had some supply constraints on our Fabric Care business that we had to address. We also reinstated merchandising support in the U.S. We've reinstated media support and that is playing out in volume share accelerating on the Fabric Care business. The other dynamic is family care sequentially improving from a volume share standpoint where we have seen a very high base when private label was in less supply and didn't have merchandising in the July to December period of last calendar year. That is being annualized.  So those two will continue, hopefully, to be a tailwind to our share position in the U.S. But as John said, it's hard to predict and look around the corner here, there are many, many variables that we don't control, but those two businesses explain the strength and hopefully, should have more upside going forward.\nJon Moeller : And just one attempt at changing maybe a little bit some of the semantics from supply issue to supply opportunity. Our supply organization has done a terrific job. If you look at the last 15 quarters or so, our organic sales -- the amount of organic sales end of period to beginning of the period is up 80%, 90%, which is a really good thing. And they've done a tremendous job of trying to keep pace with that. And as we talked about, there's just additional upside to fully meet and satisfy that demand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask about the change in the commodity outlook, which for the first time in quite some time, the outlook has actually moved lower sequentially, understanding that there's a lot of moving pieces, but can you just help us understand what's driving that? Is it broad-based? Or are there particular inputs where you're starting to see inflation moderate more substantially?\nAndre Schulten : Peter, it really varies period-over-period, month-over-month. We've seen pulp was holding relatively steady. It has come down a little bit now on different grades. Propylene, polyethylene has come down a little bit. But it's really broad based and it's changing month over month, week or week. In general, what we're seeing is -- as you would have known, the supply situation is easing a little bit, and that's obviously helping the market dynamic, both on commodities as well as on transportation and warehousing. There's no guarantee that, that will continue. We don't know what China reopening will do to the commodity market. That's a significant variable that nobody really understands at this point, I would argue. So we're watching this closely, and we continue to forecast based on what we know today, which is spot prices. I think the other dynamic we can't forget is that our suppliers are still working through their input cost inflation, their labor inflation, their energy cost inflation. So there are two opposing forces here. One is the desire of our suppliers as contracts roll over to pass that through to us. And the other one is input costs easing in the short term. So we have to take both into account when we think about our ability to pass through cost helps.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira : I have a clarification and a question. Andre, in your response about the destocking that should be over in the next quarter, is that also applicable for China? And how are you seeing China consumption rebounding as you exit the port and obviously, with the reopening? And if I can squeeze up your question, can you comment on how you're preparing your portfolio in Europe for potential recession? As you called out, things may -- and the bills -- energy bills may be kicking up now as we enter your third quarter fiscal.\nAndre Schulten : Hey, Andrea. Yes, the China destocking, I think, will largely depend on the China reopening and that's very hard to predict. I think if consumer mobility returns to normal levels quickly, that will be a tailwind for every retailer with real estate on the ground. And that's really the major issue that off-line retail is facing. So if traffic returns to normal levels, that will be a big help, and obviously, no further destocking required. I'll leave it at that because I have no good way of knowing not as anybody else. We expect consumption in China to reaccelerate to mid-single digits over what period is hard to predict. But in the midterm, that's where we see our China market and it continues to be an important investment market for us. We have a very capable organization on the ground, and they are spending their days and nights to get ready for that. Fine-tune our innovation, ensure we have the best possible marketing programs, both digitally and with our retail partners on the ground.  I think on the European portfolio, we have prepared, like everywhere else, our portfolio for a recession. And it comes back to the basic strategies on the categories we play in. We are in nondiscretionary categories to a large degree that people won't deselect easily. They continue to wash their laundry, they continue to wash their hair. So that's number one for recession proving our business model. Step number two is investment in irresistible superiority. When consumers see the benefit our brands can deliver, the value will be clear to them and our ability to communicate that value clearly is critical, and that's why we continue to invest in both the performance as well as the communication. And then the last part is just accessibility of the portfolio, both in terms of brand tiering, so having premium brands but also value brands and price points across different channels, be that discounters or other retailers. So I think the portfolio proofing has been done, and I think it's showing results in a very difficult environment that we think speak to the strength of the strategy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy : We've covered a lot of ground. I want to try to connect the dots here on the 8% organic sales growth if we exclude the items that Andre called out, with comments in the press release around market contraction. So in the release, you mentioned market contractions in Hair Care, Grooming, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Family Care, across much of the portfolio. But as Andre talked about, the org sales in the quarter was closer to 8%. And if we look at the comp, it was actually an acceleration on a two-year stack basis. So what I really want to do is just -- I know we've covered a lot of ground on this call, just to make sure I'm kind of clear on how you're seeing category growth, how you're seeing elasticities and consumer behavior coming out of the quarter. Because it seems to me that the quarter is actually on a like-for-like basis, possibly even better than The Street had modeled. And setting aside China, you sound pretty constructive on demand dynamics. You sound pretty good on elasticity sort of relatively unchanged. And I just want to make sure that's the messaging for investors.\nAndre Schulten : Yes. And I would characterize, obviously, the Russia element will be with us, and that's real. I think the market growth has been around 5% to 6% with a negative volume component and a very positive price component. I would expect that in the midterm to moderate to 3% to 4% overall growth and still have a negative volume component with offset by strong pricing that we continue to flow through the market. If you look at overall market size over the past three months, that has been the case, and that's where we expect it to be going forward. And that's pretty much in line with how we model the balance of the balance of the fiscal year. Our job here is to be ahead of that. And that's why we're investing that we will continue to double down on the priority investments everywhere. Jon, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nJon Moeller : Yes. It's a repeat, but it's worth repeating. It's a bit of a rain drop on the fray, Kevin. But I just want to highlight so that we don't get ahead of ourselves, how uncertain, for example, China is. Andre said it several times, we don't have visibility. We have, within our own operations, offices, innovation centers, plants, our current estimate of the infection rate is up to 80%. And we're sitting here in the week before Chinese New Year when all the traveling occurs. At the same time, we have a government and a populist who desperately wants things to get better. It's just very hard to say, hey, we should assume that as we go forward, China comes back like a tire. Certainly, we all hope that's true. I hope for China, that's true. But just you really need to understand how uncertain things are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.\nMark Astrachan : I wanted to move from that rain drop question to a bit more funny question and just ask about whether the resilience of the U.S. consumer has surprised you all sort of what's embedded in guidance from here? I know what you said, Andre, about the category, but that was, I think, on a global basis. So how do you generally think about U.S. trends from here? And within the portfolio, have there been any surprises relative to historical expectations, meaning things that have performed better than you would have expected? And kind of what are you watching from here from a portfolio standpoint, all within the context of the U.S. business?\nAndre Schulten : Mark, I wouldn't expect the U.S. to fundamentally change. If you look back over the past six months, private label shares in the U.S. have been relatively steady. We've seen 20 basis points to 30 basis points of increase in private label share, which is a metric we're watching closely. But if you look at sequential share, absolute shares of private label, it continues to hover around 16%, past three, six and even 12 months. So there hasn't been a significant shift in consumer behavior in terms of trade down. I think the way that our pricing was executed with great support in innovation and great support in terms of marketing spend has helped. Our strategy isn't shifting. I don't see the market shifting significantly. All of that with a caveat that who knows what the next six months are going to bring. But if past behavior over the last six months, nine months is any indication, I think the consumer is relatively steady in the U.S., which gives us great confidence. It's our biggest market. We do well, expanding volume share, as I said, and hopefully have a bit more upside here as Family Care and Fabric Care continue to gain momentum.\nJon Moeller : And this continues to be a market, the U.S. market that is very responsive in a positive way to innovation that improves performance, both for the product and the package. And we have many examples, Dawn Powerwash as an example, introduced at a premium price. The brand has grown at 50% since that introduction and Dawn has driven 90% of category growth in that situation. Down Powerwash, again, a premium priced item that was introduced largely during difficult economic times as a standalone brand would be the third largest brand of the category. So I just used that as an example for the continued positive responsiveness of U.S. consumers to innovation, and we've got a lot of innovation coming.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein.\nCallum Elliott : Great. I wanted to come back, please, to the brand spend dynamic. And Andre, I think the example you gave to Baby Care is quite powerful. If you can increase so meaningfully while simultaneously cutting dollar spend. I guess that's probably driven by digital and better targeting there versus traditional media. My question is, do you think these benefits are sustainable or over the longer term, are we not likely to see some of these digital ROIs come back down as digital ad pricing goes up and some of your competitors start to catch up with your capabilities there?\nAndre Schulten : I believe that we believe that we're just at the beginning actually of our productivity curve. And it's driven by two things. I think Baby Care was one of the -- U.S. Baby Care was one of the more aggressive ones and one of the more obvious ones when you think about the consumer target, it's very narrow, right? You're looking for households with babies and diapering age. So going from mass TV where you have a lot of ways to hitting that target, which is about 3% to 4% of the population, provided the most obvious opportunity to drive synergies here. But we've learned also in other businesses, the opposite works. When you think about Fabric Care, everybody is doing laundry. So you've got a very wide target that you need to reach. And the Fabric Care team in the U.S. has brought their media planning and buying in-house, developing proprietary algorithms to better place ads during the TV programming, for example, and that in and of itself has allowed $65 million of savings in one year, while increasing frequency. So both models work and both models are still not everywhere. So we've got two examples in the U.S. There are many categories in the U.S. that are still building their own approach to drive these synergies and there's the whole world outside of the U.S., which is still building on the capabilities that we are developing. So we see this as a area of continued investment in terms of our own capabilities with a great ability to drive productivity for years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pitcher of Redburn.\nChris Pitcher : Apologies for carrying on the inventories question. But Jon, you mentioned you were looking at a normalization. But in the Investor Day, you showed obviously a significant improvement in your supply chain efficiency. Do you think you're in the position over the next couple of years where U.S. retailers could operate at even lower inventories and improving your relationship with them is working capital part of the conversation that you have with them in sort of helping form share of shelf. And then thank you for the color on the international business. Could you share with how fast your Indian business grew in the period because it looks like the India consumer there is recovering and whether you're seeing a sustained double-digit recovery there as well?\nJon Moeller : Thanks for the question. I do think that there's a significant opportunity for the entire supply system to operate at lower levels of inventory. And one of the enablers there in addition to supply dependability is increasingly looking at the supply chain across we historically looked at it as our supply chain and our customer supply chain as we're beginning to have conversations about this was one supply chain, would we do things differently? And the answer is almost yes. And the opportunities that are resident within that discussion are significant. So I do think we will continue to have that conversation and try to make progress in a way that benefits both ourselves and our retail partners and ultimately the consumer with higher on-shelf availability. And then go ahead, Andre, you want to talk about India?\nAndre Schulten : Yes, sure. The India business continues to accelerate. We saw Q1 growing 12% organic sales; Q2, 13%. And India is a good example of those capabilities that we were just talking about actually rolling out and being very effective. So the digital infrastructure we've been able -- the team has been able to create in India is quite impressive and that's contributing to our ability to drive disproportionate growth there, both from a sales capability standpoint and from a media capability standpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.\nJason English : Congrats on that sales milestone and the market share progression this quarter. I've got -- I'm going to cheat and like many, jam a few questions into one. So first, what geographies are you taking the majority of the incremental pricing in? Second, you're signaling more reinvestment on the com as supply improves, what shape do you expect it to take, i.e., product, advertising promo, et cetera? And lastly, I don't know if I should read much into this, but you've made substantially more references to volume share rather than value share this quarter. Does this reflect a shift in prioritization and focus for you?\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, Jason. On the geographies, I would not see any disproportionate tilt towards one or the other. If you look at the cost structure, the implications, they are pretty similar across the different regions. Timing might shift. Category is, obviously, shifting.\nJon Moeller : Yes. There's one exception to that, I agree totally as it relates to pricing related to commodities. But there are some markets, of course, where currencies are devaluating massively.\nAndre Schulten : Right.\nJon Moeller : And there is where you see our highest amount of pricing, take Argentina, Turkey, the usual suspects.\nAndre Schulten : Correct. So if you look at the enterprise market, that\u2019s where we generally take higher pricing in line with overall inflation in the market. So to Jon's point, that will be -- that will continue to be the case. There are other markets where pricing is notoriously more difficult to think about Japan, think about the G7 in general. So that's where you see less pricing impact. But that's not different from what we would have seen over the past few quarters.  Look, our desire to reinvest is across all vectors of superiority. So it is product package innovation. It's in communication, it's in go-to-market execution. So all of those are relevant. They differ by region, by category, obviously. The reason why we're focusing more on volume share is we believe that it is our job and opportunity to continue to drive penetration of our brands. We have a huge runway when you think about our ability to continue to drive consumption and even the most developed categories. So we want to focus our team on driving -- continue to drive household penetration, continue to create jobs to be done, continue to drive consumption opportunities. A world in which all of the market growth is driven by pricing is obviously not sustainable. And so both elements need to come back in balance, and that's why you see us talk both elements here between value and volume share.\nJon Moeller : Just for clarity on this point, though, I am not interested in volume share at the expense of value share. Volume share is a way to deliver value share. So at least we not be clear, it's both that are important, not a shift in emphasis between one or the other. The other reason that I wanted to make sure that we talked a little bit about volume is that it's a natural concern when we're taking this pricing as to how your volume is holding up and how -- particularly how is your volume share holding up. So we just wanted to be transparent on how we're seeing it, which is very attractive so far.\nOperator: The final question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney : I want to ask a simple question that's really complicated. When you look -- when you talk -- at the time you gave us the initial commodity guidance for the fiscal year '23, rough numbers U.S.-based spot costs for freight and energy composite for your company, you're down something like 9% since then. And you have lowered your expectation for commodity inflation. Simple question is, can you -- are your experience costs for this quarter below their peak? Like I see the year-over-year was 380 basis points of cost push headwind to gross margin versus 510 last quarter. So there's a -- can you confirm there's been a sequential step down? And secondly, could you -- in what quarter would we expect costs to no longer be a headwind like be all in the base? Would that be the June quarter, the September quarter? Or is that just impossible to say? I know there's a lot to unpack with cross-currency exposure and things that I don't see in U.S.-based spot. But it does seem like your costs are down from their peak.\nAndre Schulten : Well, on the second question, I don't know. It's just a very simple answer. On the first question, yes, we see sequential progress on the cost side. But as I mentioned earlier, it's important to understand the two opposing forces. We don't buy commodities. We buy pack material. We buy super absorbers. We buy films, et cetera. And our suppliers are still in the process of passing through their own inflation. So while their input costs via commodity helps is certainly easing, they also haven't fully caught up to their cost structure hits that they have experienced over the past few quarters. So we'll continue to work with them to find the right solution here. But when exactly that balance is going to occur, hard to predict.\nJon Moeller : Yes. And just one additional piece of detail on that. It's not that they're slow. It's that we have contracts that cover, as Andre said earlier, cover a period of time. And in many cases, prices are fixed for a period of time. And then it's time to enter into a new contract. And that's what's going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future, not forever. But that's why it's difficult to look at, and I know you acknowledge this, look at U.S. spot prices as the holistic indicator of the direction of things such as not -- that's not sufficient.\nJon Moeller : Okay. I want to thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your patience and unpacking all of this. John is going to be -- John, Andre and the team will be available the rest of the day to continue helping with that. My own unpack, I am very, very proud and thankful for the efforts of our team to grow 5% organically to do it across all categories to continue to hold share in the U.S. build volume share, to be able to increase our sales guidance all against the backdrop of significant deceleration of the market in China, the situation in Eastern Europe, the highest inflation rates in 40 years. This team has done an incredible job of executing our integrated strategy to continue momentum through all of that; and similarly, on the bottom line. We talked about the impact on the quarter of commodities, foreign exchange and transportation. If you look at the last fiscal year, plus our forecast for the current year, you're talking about 50% of profit being eliminated as a result of headwinds in those three areas. We grew earnings per share last year. The team did. We're forecasting to grow earnings per share modestly this year. It speaks to two things, I think, that are very, very important. One is the quality of the team; and two, is the relevance, the continued relevance of the strategy.  So for what it's worth, that's my unpack. And if you want to call on and discuss that further, I'm happy to do so. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Dara, this is Jon. I would just add a couple of pieces of perspective at a macro level. The world seems to want everything to be better as do I. That's really not reality though. There's an incredible amount of uncertainty that remains. None of us, I think, globally really understand what the recovery rate in China is going to be as an example. And nobody really understands what the new policies and practices are going to mean in terms of consumer confidence in that context. You have the war in Eastern Europe. You have the highest inflation rates in 40 years. You have continued volatility in both the currency markets and the commodity markets. And importantly, that currency exposure for us is not a simple dollar exposure. There's a lot of cross rate exposures within that, which I realize makes it difficult to penetrate. But for example, the cross rate between the British pound and the euro has a significant impact on our bottom line.  So all that put together, while I'm extremely happy with the progress the organization is making I'm extremely confident that the strategy that we have is the right one that's going to continue to serve us well. It's just not an easy time to be taking up guidance to the top range of possibility. Yes. Just one quick clarification there. The $40 billion that Andre is referring to is a annualized run rate number. So it was $10 billion in the quarter, which translates to $40 billion, [Indiscernible] 4, just so people don't get too carried away. Lauren, the point that you made and the point Andre made, there's a lot of upside here as we bring this capacity online. We indicated we're not meeting full demand in some of the protection segments. We have opportunity, as you said, across the board. So we're investing pretty significantly. I think as he said and you've said the bigger impact will be in our ability to accelerate the top line. It should not be a significant bottom line drag. And just a little bit of color on the inventory piece, which has been accurately described a couple of times here. This is a fairly simple dynamic that's occurring. When there is supply volatility and uncertainty, it causes retailers to build higher inventory levels. When there's demand volatility, it does the same. So we've been through a period where inventories have been a little bit higher than normal in some of our retail channels. Supply assurance is increasing, demand volatility is decreasing. So those inventories are understandably being brought down. And so Bryan, I don't expect that there's a significant swing here quarter-to-quarter. I think this is the system normalizing itself. And one other opportunity that we've talked about a little bit this morning, as additional supply comes online, there are often opportunities to increase support for the business to take advantage of that additional capacity. So we'll be looking for those, as Andre said, positive ROI opportunities to drive the business.  You asked about enterprise markets. When you get down to a country level, of course, it's very variable. But 14% growth on the top line, all three regions growing at over 10%. So the strength is pretty broad there. And that, again, just for clarity, is a U.S. dynamic that Andre has just described, the 10% growth. And I'll leave it there. And as Andre said, the conversation, much more constructive for all concerned when we focus on improving consumer value holistically defined. And that's exactly what Andre was talking about in terms of the combination of innovation and pricing. And when that's the conversation, it takes on a very different nature than a more transactional discussion. Also don't forget, our retail partners are the owners of the private label brands that we compete against. They're facing many of the same dynamics in terms of their cost inputs that we are. So just to reconfirm what Andre said, it's been a generally constructive discussion. I don't see anything in my interactions with our retail partners that causes an inflection in that discussion in the near term. And just one attempt at changing maybe a little bit some of the semantics from supply issue to supply opportunity. Our supply organization has done a terrific job. If you look at the last 15 quarters or so, our organic sales -- the amount of organic sales end of period to beginning of the period is up 80%, 90%, which is a really good thing. And they've done a tremendous job of trying to keep pace with that. And as we talked about, there's just additional upside to fully meet and satisfy that demand. Yes. It's a repeat, but it's worth repeating. It's a bit of a rain drop on the fray, Kevin. But I just want to highlight so that we don't get ahead of ourselves, how uncertain, for example, China is. Andre said it several times, we don't have visibility. We have, within our own operations, offices, innovation centers, plants, our current estimate of the infection rate is up to 80%. And we're sitting here in the week before Chinese New Year when all the traveling occurs. At the same time, we have a government and a populist who desperately wants things to get better. It's just very hard to say, hey, we should assume that as we go forward, China comes back like a tire. Certainly, we all hope that's true. I hope for China, that's true. But just you really need to understand how uncertain things are. And this continues to be a market, the U.S. market that is very responsive in a positive way to innovation that improves performance, both for the product and the package. And we have many examples, Dawn Powerwash as an example, introduced at a premium price. The brand has grown at 50% since that introduction and Dawn has driven 90% of category growth in that situation. Down Powerwash, again, a premium priced item that was introduced largely during difficult economic times as a standalone brand would be the third largest brand of the category. So I just used that as an example for the continued positive responsiveness of U.S. consumers to innovation, and we've got a lot of innovation coming. Thanks for the question. I do think that there's a significant opportunity for the entire supply system to operate at lower levels of inventory. And one of the enablers there in addition to supply dependability is increasingly looking at the supply chain across we historically looked at it as our supply chain and our customer supply chain as we're beginning to have conversations about this was one supply chain, would we do things differently?

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions.  Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the October to December quarter, growing organic sales in nine of 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, continued productivity savings, improving supply efficiency, sustained investment and superiority of our brands across all five vectors: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value, continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn, for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan fiscal year-to-date enables us to increase the guidance range for organic sales growth and maintain ranges for core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners.  Moving to the second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 5%, pricing at a 10 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 6 points driven by a combination of market contraction, trade inventory reductions and portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens, Feminine Care, Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Hair Care was up mid-single digits. Baby Care, Family Care, Oral Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up low single digits. Grooming was in line with prior year. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 6%. Greater China organic sales were down 7% versus prior year, as the market continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns and weaker consumer confidence. We continue to expect a slow recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Long term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 14% with each of the three regions up 10% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing share. U.S. volume share is up 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter, delivering sequential improvement from quarter one.  Recent innovations like Downy Rinse and Refresh in fabric enhancers and Dawn Powerwash in hand dishwashing are extending superiority advantages and driving value and volume share growth. Innovation also serves as a catalyst for pricing across our other brands and forms in their category segments. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.59, down 4% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 5%. Core operating margin decreased 170 basis points, primarily due to gross margin pressure from commodities and foreign exchange. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 70 basis points. Productivity improvements were 110 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 72%, primarily due to a temporary reduction in payables. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, continued solid results across the top line, bottom line and cash for the first half of the fiscal year. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. As discussed during our Investor Day in November, we are renewing our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly reporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies, Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value creation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. We expanded on each of these at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend or listen in remotely, I encourage you to review the materials on our IR events website. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with commitment to deliver irresistible superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now moving to guidance. We continue to expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and pack material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation are still a significant headwind versus last fiscal year, though we have seen some modest sequential improvement. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind. But like raw and pack materials, we've seen modest directional improvement. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.2 billion after-tax impact for the fiscal year. Freight costs remain higher versus prior year, and we continue to expect the $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.7 billion after tax, $1.50 per share, a 26 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. For perspective, recall that we began the year expecting approximately $1.33 of cost and FX headwinds. So despite some modest relief since last quarter, our current outlook is still $0.17 worse than our ingoing position. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As we've said before, we believe this is a bottom line rough patch to grow through with continued investment in the business and underlying strategies. As I noted at the outset, our solid first half results enable us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 4% to 5%. Within this company-wide range, we -- there are many puts and takes. As I mentioned, we expect to see some modest improvement in China, but European markets have softened as high inflation affects consumer spending. The U.S. remains relatively strong to date, and most enterprise markets remain resilient. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. The significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion of dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, we continue to face high year-over-year commodity and transportation cost inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. These macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. We attempt to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward towards our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We are committed to driving productivity, improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth.  With that, we're happy to take your questions. All right. I'll give it a try, Dara. So on the total year forecast, I think with half one results in, we are on track, very well on track to deliver the year and the guidance ranges that we're communicating. When you look at our EPS delivery for the balance of the year, we are assuming, as we always do, current spot rates on commodities and foreign exchange. And given our desire to reinvest, we would not assume that every dollar that we see in commodities and foreign exchange immediately flows through to the bottom line. We see significant upside for us to continue to invest in superiority across all five vectors. And if that upside is available to us, we will do that in the short term and the midterm. We have -- also, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are still above ingoing assumptions. So $0.17 worse than we had at the time when we provided the initial guidance. So that leads us to continue to be pointed towards the lower end of the core EPS range. But as you say, with more help coming, that probably is increasing our confidence to deliver that range or hopefully slightly better.  On the top line, again, when we look at the half one results, we feel very good about our standing here to deliver a higher -- the higher end of our initial top line guidance. So that's why we raised to 4% to 5% organic sales growth. And the fact that we see low volumes in the current quarter really is important to understand in more depth. So the 6% or 5.8% negative volume on the quarter, when you dissect it about half of that is not really consumption driven. So we have 1 point related to our portfolio choice in Russia, where we cut the portfolio by 50% to focus on essentials versus the full portfolio we were operating before. We have about 2 points related to temporary inventory reductions, which we saw in China with the market heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns and O&D. And especially on the offline side of the market, we see retailer inventories reduce reserve cash. We saw some inventory reduction in power Oral Care and Appliances in Europe. And we have seen in late December, very strong consumption in the U.S., where retail orders haven't quite kept up with that consumption. So if you strip that out, the actual consumption-related volume decline is about 3% on the quarter, which is in line with what we've seen in quarter one, which is in line with our expectation and elasticities that we would have expected, given the amount of pricing that is in the market. What is encouraging to us to raise the top line guidance is that our volume shares are holding globally, our value shares are holding globally. And when we look at the U.S., our biggest and most important markets, we actually see an acceleration of volume share by 50 basis points over the past three months and even 80 basis points over the past one month. Again, all of that gives us confidence to raise the top line guidance while we want to preserve the flexibility to continue to invest in superiority to drive more sustainable growth. And honestly, that's going to be our job here over the next few quarters, continue to drive household penetration to reinvigorate overall volume growth in the category. Yes, Lauren. We are -- the short-term effect that we are describing here is indeed Fem Care related. We see on the top end of the portfolio, very strong growth. We have seen very strong growth over the past two years. And we are just need to catch up in terms of overall capacity to demand ratio, both on the top end of our pads business, which is the Radiant or Infinity business. And as you well know, we're still not up to full demand levels on tampons, which we will install -- are in the process of installing new capacity in the back half. The investments across businesses to catch up to the very significant increase in terms of business size is underway. So we have capacity investments across most businesses. I wouldn't expect it to be a significant drag on the bottom line. In fact, the growth that we anticipate will more than outweigh the cost of investing in capacity, and that's the plan, obviously. So we have high confidence in our growth potential and that's really what's triggering these capacity investments. Just in the U.S., for example, the last quarter was the first quarter we've reached $40 billion in sales, up from $30 billion in sales just four years ago. So -- and again, our growth rate continues to look very positive. Volume shares are up and better than the market, our volumes are trending to positive numbers year-over-year. So we need to keep up with that. The net of it is all positive. Fair enough. That's correct. I would say the operating environment continues to be difficult, and we expect it to be difficult in the second half. While I think the U.S. is holding up very well. Enterprise markets are holding up very well. As John said earlier, recovery in China will be very hard to predict and probably not a straight line. We expect China to be difficult in the second half as it was in the first half. The European markets will continue to have to work through very high inflation numbers I think we've seen a little bit of help via a warmer winter season that has helped energy prices. But Europe is not through, I think, inflationary pressures and consumers are still to see many of the consequences in terms of the eating builds as we are entering February and March. That doesn't change anything we do. I think the best way for us to get through all of this is to continue to invest in the business and to continue to execute with excellence, which the organization is doing and which is driving these good results. Our ability to carefully balance pricing and productivity to offset the inflationary pressures is critical. Within pricing, careful execution and combining pricing with innovation and sufficient investment to drive superiority of our brands is critical. So that's why we want to preserve some level of flexibility to do those investments as we get through the second half. Yes. I think Jon is exactly right. Our on-shelf availability is getting better. We're up now to 95% on-shelf availability, up from 93%. We make sequential progress. So as the supply chain is stabilizing, I wouldn't expect immediate return of those days on hand. I think some of it will come back, but it will take a longer period of time. I would characterize our current media spending and support spending for our brands as sufficient, which we are paying a lot of attention with each of the businesses. John pays a lot of attention with each of the businesses to ensure that is the case. And sufficiency is defined as sufficient reach, sufficient frequency. It's not defined as dollars spent. So again, I want to come back to the fact that, yes, we view the current business as fully funded, sufficiently funded in order to continue growing our brands, their top-of-mind awareness and their equity. When we reinvest because there is a positive return in the short term, and we can further strengthen our brands or specific innovation that is out there. In the most recent quarter, for example, we've increased quarter-over-quarter, our total ad spend by $140 million. And that is a function of innovation timing. It's also a function of merchandising support and core timing advertising with that retailer support. So we -- you see us adhere to that principle of fully supporting our brands if there are opportunities to create short-term ROI, will continue to double down. Yes. And if you look at L.A., 21% growth, for example, so that will be the top end of the growth and fairly consistent here. So enterprise markets continue to deliver very strong results.  Last point maybe on the media investment. The synergies we're able to create are a real and not insignificant. So if you look at Baby Care, for example, that business has grown 10% last year. They have completely shifted the way they run their media. They've increased reach by 20%, increased top-of-mind awareness by 26%. All of that while they saved 15% of their media spend. So the equation here really allows for sufficiency at lower cost. Hey, Olivia. The -- let me start with elasticities. The overall view has not changed. We continue to see more favorable elasticities than we would have expected on historical data pretty much everywhere, but Europe focused markets. And you can see with 10% pricing flowing through. And when you strip out the non-consumption-related volume effect, a 3% reduction in volume, that is a very benign elasticity that we're seeing in aggregate and allows us to hold volume share and value share as the pricing flows through. So we feel good about, again, the strategy, doing what we wanted to do and the execution being very diligent in each of the markets. Europe is the one place where elasticities have returned to what we would have expected more on historical data, and that is driven by the increased pressure on the consumer. We're also seeing a little bit of price lag here. So private label, for example, is pricing slower in Europe, and that increases temporarily the price gap versus private label. Nothing we didn't plan on, but that explains part of the higher elasticities. In terms of peak pricing, you're right, many of the large price increases get left this fiscal year. But that doesn't mean that we're not putting more pricing in the market. So for example, we have a number of price increases that go into effect in February. So there's two components here. One where lapping price increases were executed last year, but we're also still passing through some of the cost pressures via incremental pricing around the world. I wouldn't expect a structural shift in SG&A spend. I think what you're seeing in the run rate is about what we expect to need in order to be sufficiently funded and the gross margin -- and most of the margin expansion will come from gross margin expansion as we ramp up productivity, pricing continues to flow through and that builds gross margin period-over-period. So that will be the bigger contributor. And we're not counting on any major reductions in SG&A beyond what productivity allows us to deliver again, at current sufficiency levels, and we are very carefully looking at what can we reinvest actually and still deliver within the range that we want to deliver. Yes, Kaumil. The environment continues to be constructive. We don't see much change in retailer conversations. It's focused on how do we best play the role that we need to play as a category leader in many of the markets by combining pricing with innovation, executing pricing in a way that consumers can appropriately choose from different price points, different value tiers. And how that plays out at retail shelf, both virtual and physical shelves in the best possible way, so we can help them grow their category grow foot traffic, et cetera. Those are really the majority of the conversations I would characterize this quarter or next quarter as any different than the previous quarters, where really it's about how do we do this, when is the best time to execute. It's not should we or must we take pricing. I think everybody still understands that we are recovering costs after we recover as much as we can with productivity. Yes. Robert, on the volume side, I think the Russia effect will be with us for one more quarter before we annualize. And on the inventory side, as we said before, we believe this was a onetime adjustment. I wouldn't expect this to come back immediately. I wouldn't expect a significant further reduction in inventory. When we look at the U.S., for example, where we have good data in terms of retailer days on hand, we believe we are at pre-COVID levels, which is about the level that we've proven to operate reliably with our retail partners. So I would expect that to be a one-timer with potentially some help coming in back over the next few quarters.  The volume share dynamic in the U.S. is driven largely by Fabric Care coming back into supply. We have talked in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and also in the first quarter of this fiscal year, that we had some supply constraints on our Fabric Care business that we had to address. We also reinstated merchandising support in the U.S. We've reinstated media support and that is playing out in volume share accelerating on the Fabric Care business. The other dynamic is family care sequentially improving from a volume share standpoint where we have seen a very high base when private label was in less supply and didn't have merchandising in the July to December period of last calendar year. That is being annualized.  So those two will continue, hopefully, to be a tailwind to our share position in the U.S. But as John said, it's hard to predict and look around the corner here, there are many, many variables that we don't control, but those two businesses explain the strength and hopefully, should have more upside going forward. Peter, it really varies period-over-period, month-over-month. We've seen pulp was holding relatively steady. It has come down a little bit now on different grades. Propylene, polyethylene has come down a little bit. But it's really broad based and it's changing month over month, week or week. In general, what we're seeing is -- as you would have known, the supply situation is easing a little bit, and that's obviously helping the market dynamic, both on commodities as well as on transportation and warehousing. There's no guarantee that, that will continue. We don't know what China reopening will do to the commodity market. That's a significant variable that nobody really understands at this point, I would argue. So we're watching this closely, and we continue to forecast based on what we know today, which is spot prices. I think the other dynamic we can't forget is that our suppliers are still working through their input cost inflation, their labor inflation, their energy cost inflation. So there are two opposing forces here. One is the desire of our suppliers as contracts roll over to pass that through to us. And the other one is input costs easing in the short term. So we have to take both into account when we think about our ability to pass through cost helps. Hey, Andrea. Yes, the China destocking, I think, will largely depend on the China reopening and that's very hard to predict. I think if consumer mobility returns to normal levels quickly, that will be a tailwind for every retailer with real estate on the ground. And that's really the major issue that off-line retail is facing. So if traffic returns to normal levels, that will be a big help, and obviously, no further destocking required. I'll leave it at that because I have no good way of knowing not as anybody else. We expect consumption in China to reaccelerate to mid-single digits over what period is hard to predict. But in the midterm, that's where we see our China market and it continues to be an important investment market for us. We have a very capable organization on the ground, and they are spending their days and nights to get ready for that. Fine-tune our innovation, ensure we have the best possible marketing programs, both digitally and with our retail partners on the ground.  I think on the European portfolio, we have prepared, like everywhere else, our portfolio for a recession. And it comes back to the basic strategies on the categories we play in. We are in nondiscretionary categories to a large degree that people won't deselect easily. They continue to wash their laundry, they continue to wash their hair. So that's number one for recession proving our business model. Step number two is investment in irresistible superiority. When consumers see the benefit our brands can deliver, the value will be clear to them and our ability to communicate that value clearly is critical, and that's why we continue to invest in both the performance as well as the communication. And then the last part is just accessibility of the portfolio, both in terms of brand tiering, so having premium brands but also value brands and price points across different channels, be that discounters or other retailers. So I think the portfolio proofing has been done, and I think it's showing results in a very difficult environment that we think speak to the strength of the strategy. Yes. And I would characterize, obviously, the Russia element will be with us, and that's real. I think the market growth has been around 5% to 6% with a negative volume component and a very positive price component. I would expect that in the midterm to moderate to 3% to 4% overall growth and still have a negative volume component with offset by strong pricing that we continue to flow through the market. If you look at overall market size over the past three months, that has been the case, and that's where we expect it to be going forward. And that's pretty much in line with how we model the balance of the balance of the fiscal year. Our job here is to be ahead of that. And that's why we're investing that we will continue to double down on the priority investments everywhere. Jon, I don't know if you have anything to add. Mark, I wouldn't expect the U.S. to fundamentally change. If you look back over the past six months, private label shares in the U.S. have been relatively steady. We've seen 20 basis points to 30 basis points of increase in private label share, which is a metric we're watching closely. But if you look at sequential share, absolute shares of private label, it continues to hover around 16%, past three, six and even 12 months. So there hasn't been a significant shift in consumer behavior in terms of trade down. I think the way that our pricing was executed with great support in innovation and great support in terms of marketing spend has helped. Our strategy isn't shifting. I don't see the market shifting significantly. All of that with a caveat that who knows what the next six months are going to bring. But if past behavior over the last six months, nine months is any indication, I think the consumer is relatively steady in the U.S., which gives us great confidence. It's our biggest market. We do well, expanding volume share, as I said, and hopefully have a bit more upside here as Family Care and Fabric Care continue to gain momentum. I believe that we believe that we're just at the beginning actually of our productivity curve. And it's driven by two things. I think Baby Care was one of the -- U.S. Baby Care was one of the more aggressive ones and one of the more obvious ones when you think about the consumer target, it's very narrow, right? You're looking for households with babies and diapering age. So going from mass TV where you have a lot of ways to hitting that target, which is about 3% to 4% of the population, provided the most obvious opportunity to drive synergies here. But we've learned also in other businesses, the opposite works. When you think about Fabric Care, everybody is doing laundry. So you've got a very wide target that you need to reach. And the Fabric Care team in the U.S. has brought their media planning and buying in-house, developing proprietary algorithms to better place ads during the TV programming, for example, and that in and of itself has allowed $65 million of savings in one year, while increasing frequency. So both models work and both models are still not everywhere. So we've got two examples in the U.S. There are many categories in the U.S. that are still building their own approach to drive these synergies and there's the whole world outside of the U.S., which is still building on the capabilities that we are developing. So we see this as a area of continued investment in terms of our own capabilities with a great ability to drive productivity for years to come. Yes, sure. The India business continues to accelerate. We saw Q1 growing 12% organic sales; Q2, 13%. And India is a good example of those capabilities that we were just talking about actually rolling out and being very effective. So the digital infrastructure we've been able -- the team has been able to create in India is quite impressive and that's contributing to our ability to drive disproportionate growth there, both from a sales capability standpoint and from a media capability standpoint. Thanks, Jason. On the geographies, I would not see any disproportionate tilt towards one or the other. If you look at the cost structure, the implications, they are pretty similar across the different regions. Timing might shift. Category is, obviously, shifting. Right. Correct. So if you look at the enterprise market, that's where we generally take higher pricing in line with overall inflation in the market. So to Jon's point, that will be -- that will continue to be the case. There are other markets where pricing is notoriously more difficult to think about Japan, think about the G7 in general. So that's where you see less pricing impact. But that's not different from what we would have seen over the past few quarters.  Look, our desire to reinvest is across all vectors of superiority. So it is product package innovation. It's in communication, it's in go-to-market execution. So all of those are relevant. They differ by region, by category, obviously. The reason why we're focusing more on volume share is we believe that it is our job and opportunity to continue to drive penetration of our brands. We have a huge runway when you think about our ability to continue to drive consumption and even the most developed categories. So we want to focus our team on driving -- continue to drive household penetration, continue to create jobs to be done, continue to drive consumption opportunities. A world in which all of the market growth is driven by pricing is obviously not sustainable. And so both elements need to come back in balance, and that's why you see us talk both elements here between value and volume share. Well, on the second question, I don't know. It's just a very simple answer. On the first question, yes, we see sequential progress on the cost side. But as I mentioned earlier, it's important to understand the two opposing forces. We don't buy commodities. We buy pack material. We buy super absorbers. We buy films, et cetera. And our suppliers are still in the process of passing through their own inflation. So while their input costs via commodity helps is certainly easing, they also haven't fully caught up to their cost structure hits that they have experienced over the past few quarters. So we'll continue to work with them to find the right solution here. But when exactly that balance is going to occur, hard to predict."

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the July to September quarter and provides a solid start to the fiscal year. We're growing organic sales in all 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, accelerating productivity savings, and improving supply sufficiency. Together, this progress enables us to maintain guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Despite continued high commodity and transportation costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. Moving to the first quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 7%, pricing added 9 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 3 points, primarily due to lower shipments in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens. Feminine Care was up double digits. Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up mid-singles. Family Care and Oral Care grew low single digits. Focus markets grew 4% for the quarter, with the US up 5%. Greater China organic sales were down 4% versus the prior year, modest sequential improvement in the market still affected by COVID lockdowns and weak consumer confidence. Longer term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 16% with each of the three regions, up 13% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year, with 26 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was in line with prior year with 6 of 10 categories holding or growing shares. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.57, down 2% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 7%. Core margin decreased 160 basis points and currency-neutral core margin was down 130 basis points.  Higher commodity materials and freight cost impacts combined with a 550 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 120-point headwinds, productivity savings and pricing provided 580 basis points of offset. SG&A costs as a percentage of sales were lower by 90 basis points as sales leverage and productivity improvements more than offset inflation and foreign exchange impacts.  Core operating margin decreased 70 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin increased 10 basis points, productivity improvements were a 230 basis help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 86%, we returned nearly $6.3 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $4 billion share repurchase.  In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrating strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, which are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation.  A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. The priority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.  Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments is a priority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future especially important in this volatile environment.  Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build the priority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Jon touched on each of these in our July earnings call and they will be a central part of our discussion at Investor Day in November.  Our strategic choices on portfolios, priority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, when executed well, they grow markets, which in-turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.  Now moving on to guidance, we fully expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence has positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation have remained high since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices at latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.4 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs have also remained high. Though we have seen some easing in spot prices, we've made a modest downward adjustment in our outlook and now expect a $200 million after-tax headwind on freight and transportation costs in fiscal 2023. Foreign exchange has continued its strong move against us as the US dollar has strengthened significantly against essentially all major currencies around the world. Based on current exchange rates, we forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact, an incremental hit of $400 million versus our initial outlook for the year. Combined, headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.9 billion after tax or $1.57 a share, a 27 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. We will offset a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We will continue to invest in irresistible superiority, which is even more important as we compete in some markets with local or non-US based competitors that don't see the same foreign exchange rate impact. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. As I noted at the outset, our good first quarter results enable us to confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year, across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%. On the bottom line, we are maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of in line plus 4% versus prior year. However, the steep increase in foreign exchange impact pushes our current expectations towards the lower end of the range. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. The outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, the macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't immune to the impact. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward towards the opportunities that we may fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hi good morning. Thanks for the question. Andre, I kind of wanted to pick up where you left off about your P&G's commitment to remaining fully invested even in this environment. I think the -- one of the \u2013 the biggest questions and points of pushback that I've received around P&G in recent months is just this idea that given all the headwinds that you've talked about and quantified today and given the accelerated push on productivity that you've emphasized coming into the year and again underscored today, that there isn't enough leftover to keep those investments going. Investments that have been, I think, pretty critical in investors' eyes to enabling the growth that we've experienced over recent years. So maybe you could just step back and reassure investors and give some perspective on how much room there is to invest even as you push for productivity and work to offset these headwinds and kind of counter the idea that you're going too far in curtailing investments that's necessary for future growth.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Good morning, Steve. Let me maybe start with productivity to reassure you on the ability to deliver significant productivity and then I'll turn it into the discussion on investments. We have increased our productivity numbers for the year back to pre-COVID levels. So we have good visibility to a significant step up versus what we were able to do during COVID, where we had to limit our productivity efforts to some degree to benefit innovation and shipping cases. With line time being available, we have now full ability to qualify those cost savings on the line. We have built digital capabilities to increase the speed of reformulation to drive superiority at lower cost. We have increased our ability to qualify new supply chains, if necessary, in order to reduce cost. We're improving the capability of our working teams and the plans to drive more efficient operations there. And we are constantly looking at our end-to-end supply chain, including logistics to drive costs out. And we feel very good about our continued efforts to drive cost of goods productivity. We'll talk more about that as we discuss Supply Chain 3.0. But the runway is there. The capabilities are there and we're seeing the visibility on the fiscal year results. On the media side, we also feel very good about our ability to drive continued investment in reach and quality of reach and better targeting while being able to flow productivity dollars to the bottom line to help offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the US or in Europe, but around the world. And that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach, while increasing quality of reach, and while more precisely targeting our consumers. Over the past three years, we have significantly increased spend in media by more than $1.2 billion. That's on top of the productivity we have generated over those years and on top of sales leverage. So we're also starting, I would argue from a very rich support plan for our brands. In terms of reinvestment of those savings and reinvestment of those savings reinvestment of those savings reinvestment capability within the P&L construct, we are not deprioritizing innovation. We will not deprioritize innovation. Every innovation that we've delivered in the market has created value and has continued to create value and contribute to our results. And in the overall results, we see that our approach of driving superiority is actually the strongest driver of our ability to limit volume impact, all pricing moves enable us to continue to price and deliver value to the consumer. So in aggregate, I think the team has full confidence that we can balance what we see, but it will require careful balance and doubling down on productivity to sustain innovation and investment in our group.\nJon Moeller : Hey, Steve, this is Jon. I agree with everything that Andre said, just one additional short comment. If we find ourselves, which we don't currently, in a position where we have to choose between investing in the business and delivering a bottom line target, we will invest in the business.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I thought it might be timely to get sort of an update on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior in the US. You did comment on all outlet market share being flat in the US. As you know, it's hard for us to see that via Nielsen, but also just the absolute sales growth that we see in tracked and untracked data does look like there's category contraction that's going on. So I guess, commentary on what you're seeing, maybe we could just hit on, say, laundry and whatever pick another category will to talk a bit about consumer trade down and dynamics that you're seeing in the market would be great? Thanks.\nJon Moeller : Good morning, Lauren. Yes, as you stated in your question, we seeing global value share and value share in the US holding, which is a great signal to our strategies working of providing value to consumers via innovation, as we price contribution of 9% on the quarter, with volume being down 3%, but the majority of that volume, so more than two points actually driven by Russia. Also is a good indication that the strategy of irresistible superiority works even in an inflationary environment where we need to take pricing. The US specifically, as you mentioned, our all outlet share is flat. We've seen strong growth in the US of 5%. There is some volume reduction, as you would expect, with the price increase and inflationary pressures, we see volume contracting by about a point or two and that is consumer behavior around entry inventory reduction, stretching purchasing cycles, and maybe being a bit more careful in terms of dosing. But overall, we're still able to grow sales within the market and hold share within the market at this point. To specifically talk to some of the categories you mentioned and maybe consumer behavior there. We talked about our fabric care situation in the last earnings call, where we were supply constrained on some of the portfolio in quarter three and quarter four of last fiscal year. We had reduced media spending and have reduced merchandising support stretching into quarter one of this fiscal year. And that certainly has resulted in some share pressure, which you would have seen in the xAOC shares. We feel very good about the team being able to reinstate supply to full efficiency. They have also reinstated media. They have reinstated merger support and strengthened merger support, and we're seeing our Fabric Care business coming back. Our volume share in the most recent read is actually up. We see continued strong growth on single unit dose, where the majority of the market growth is, and we're driving that market growth. In terms of consumer sentiment, in general, we see part of the consumer base in Fabric Care, for example, trending up, as I mentioned, into single unit dose. We see some growth also in our mid-tier brands as consumers are looking for value within our portfolio. They're trading into game, or into simply tied, for example, where we see some level of share growth. And that's the intent of our vertical portfolio, and our strategy to provide different value tiers to consumers. We are also seeing consumers moving two different price points. So a group of consumers is looking for value by trading into higher transaction sizes, to find lower cost per use by lower cost per unit, and we see other consumers who are more cash conscious, and they are very focused on cash outlay. So again, the other part of the strategy to provide pack sizes that stretch from below $10 for some channels and consumers to above $30 or $40 for others seems to be meeting consumers needs. So broadly, we feel good about the position we're in. There are some dynamics in terms of supply and base period that will be with us for a period of time. We remain supply constrained on a few categories, where we will see share pressure. Tampons, for example, the premium tier of our Fem Care pets business and on some health \u2013 some side of the health care business. But overall, we don't see any negative reaction, and we feel reconfirmed in our strategy by what we see in consumers' behavior.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So a strong organic sales growth result in the quarter at 7%, especially given the COVID drag in China and Russia impact, but you kept the full year sales guidance. Is that just conservatism given its early in the year and some of the external challenges? Are you feeling any more confident around that full year range? And perhaps within that answer, given the pricing has been so strong, you can just touch on the volume demand elasticity you're seeing with that higher pricing, any changes at all towards quarter end or in October and how you're thinking about that front specifically? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning Dara. The guidance of 3% to 5% is really grounded in what we believe the market will be. We see some softening in the market as we have communicated, about 3% to 4% value growth is what we're expecting the market to be. We want to grow slightly ahead of that. As you say, the first quarter gives us a good level of confidence that we're within the right range, but we're also very early in the year. So, we believe -- confirming the range is prudent. In terms of volume elasticity in my earlier remarks, as I said, we feel very encouraged by the fact that we were able to realize 9% of pricing in organic sales growth and effectively only see about a point of reduction in volume, which speaks to favorable elasticities speaks to our strategy working and providing consumers value with innovation even as we take pricing. As we always do, we assume that these elasticities return to historical levels over time. But certainly, the first quarter is a good indication. It gives us confidence that the approach we've taken around the world in terms of combining pricing with innovation and productivity in order to offset the cost is the right approach.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I guess two questions for me just related to kind of how we should be thinking about phasing in the back part of the year. One is just in terms of price increases from here going forward, are you -- are there more incremental price increases that will flow through the balance of the year, or has most of the pricing that you need in terms of what's in your plans been implemented? And I guess what I'm really driving at is are we going to start to see -- would we expect to see more of a shift to volume contributing more to the organic sales growth as we move through the back half of the year and less of incremental pricing?\nAndre Schulten: Good morning Bryan. I can't speculate or give you an answer on future pricing. We adjust in the execution of the second pricing round for many of our brands. We took pricing on all our categories in the last fiscal year, covering about 80% of sales. We're now in the second round covering about 85% of sales and that's what we see flowing through in the first quarter. Many of these price increases in the second round are being executed in September and October. For the future, we will continue to observe where our cost headwinds go where foreign exchange rate goes. It's a very dynamic environment. We will continue to carefully balance innovation, pricing, and productivity.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey everybody. Good morning. Can you talk a bit more, maybe just give us some more details on what's driving some of these cost increases, especially as we're starting to see a lot of commodity costs start to roll over, doesn't feel like you're discussing it kind of impacting your P&L yet. So can you just give us some more details there?\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Good morning, Kaumil. Look, the commodity cost increases are broad-based and different by commodity class. So, for example, we continue to see pulp increase. There is some relief on propylene and ethylene. But, in aggregate, we are not seeing broad enough relief on the input side to offset some of the inflation that is also coming from our suppliers. We call -- we don't buy propylene. We don't buy ethylene. We buy packaging materials. We buy super absorbers and materials that are secondary to that direct commodity impact. And that inflation is included in our $2.4 billion commodity headwind. So relatively stable on the commodity side. On the freight side, transportation and warehousing, as mentioned in the opening comments, we see some easing and we expect about $100 million less in headwinds, so $200 million after tax, down from $300 million. You see that market getting more back to [Audio Gap] contract prices as well. So that's been reflected. And then foreign exchange rate, obviously, is broadly across all currencies as the US dollar strengthens really around every currency in the world. And that's where we have bigger increase versus our initial guidance range about $400 million due to the ForEx effects that we've described.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Hey, thank you very much. First, a quick follow-up and then my main question. Just so I'm clear, in terms of post-COVID consumer behavior, I mean, obviously, we've got some tightening that's going on and consumers searching for value you mentioned. But do you see any changes in consumer behavior in terms of those categories that increased demand due to COVID in terms of Home and Personal Care? Are we going to be at an elevated level there, or is it kind of just go back to normal? And then my main question is, can you give us a sense of how your business is progressing in China kind of sequentially through the quarter into October and what your plans are for 11/11. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Rob. Yes, post-COVID behavior, what I would point to, obviously, is we see market contraction versus the pandemic phase in terms of antibacterial surface cleaning products, which is a small part of our total portfolio. Other than that, I wouldn't point to any major deviation from what we expected. Consumers still spend more time at home. I think, generally, the focus on our categories, which are cleaning, hygiene, health based continues to be high, which is, I think, playing back in our investments in Superiority being meaningful to consumers in order to provide value in an inflationary environment. The other element that is positive is some of the volatility might be disappearing. So when you think about categories like bath tissue or paper towels, where we had very volatile base periods with suppliers being in and out of supply over quarter three -- quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year, that is stabilizing. So, those are the post-COVID dynamics. That obviously doesn't play for China to transition to your second part of the question. We continue to see the lockdowns in China specifically with Hainan being locked down for the last two months to impact consumption significantly. Volumes in China are down 5% to 6% on the quarter. We had certainly hoped for that to ease, but we still see significant negative impact on consumer mobility from the continued strength COVID policies. We don't -- going forward, we made no assumption on that changing. So, we have to observe where the market is going. We feel well-positioned. Once we see consumer mobility return, we feel very strongly about our ability to grow in the market. We have a strong team on the ground waiting to get going once the market fully reopens. And as we said before, we expect China to be a long-term growth driver returning to mid-single-digit growth here in the near future. Operator, do we have the next question?\nOperator: Next from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Andre, I was hoping you could provide some macro context in terms of what's being embedded in the guidance. I mean there's so much going on across the world. You address China to some degree. But perhaps you could just give us a little bit more context as it relates to Europe, especially as we head into the winter; US, maybe some of the developing markets? Just kind of how you're thinking about how the macro dynamics will play out over the next -- rest of the fiscal year? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Morning Nik. As you know, we generally orient our outlook on what we know today in terms of foreign exchange rate dynamics, in terms of commodity costs, in terms of energy costs. So that's what is built into our reconfirmed guidance range. When you look at the consumer side and the market side, obviously, we see high pressure on the European consumer, with high inflation and certainly, as the energy costs will hit the consumer over the winter period, depending on how much support from the European governments provided and when we need to be extra careful in terms of ensuring that consumers have appropriate access to our portfolio, making sure that we give the right value to them via superiority, strong innovation, the right price letter the right value tier offerings. So we expect Europe to be tough from a consumer environment standpoint, but well positioned from our portfolio standpoint in order to be able to compete in that market. The same is true for the US. We continue to focus with our retail partners to have broad access across our portfolio for consumers, so they can make the right choices. As we said before, price ladder is increasingly important, cash outlay choices are increasingly important, and that's what we'll continue to focus on. Enterprise markets are holding up well. And that's a key growth driver also in the quarter. You've seen all enterprise markets grow mid-teens and even LA growing at 23%. So we'll continue to drive the same strategy in enterprise markets of providing superiority pricing and productivity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andre, just a follow-up on that last question. Maybe you could just put some parameters around that, specifically around category growth rates. I think coming into the year, the guidance was underpinned on a 3% to 4% category growth rate. I think investors were a little bit surprised by the degree of slowdown at that point, just given the strength of the business performance in recent years. First quarter, I think, was better than the market expected, certainly from a demand elasticity perspective. Maybe just comment now, again, building on Nik's question, is 3% to 4% still what's underpinning your outlook and maybe you can share for key regions, US enterprise markets, et cetera, what you observed for category growth rates in the first quarter as we think about the balance of the year. So, thanks for that.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Kevin, we expect a slowdown from the growth rate we've seen over the past years, which was 5% to a more modest 3% to 4%. That is still the case. We continue to believe that the majority of that growth will be price driven with a negative volume component, as you would expect given the inflationary pressure. We don't have more detail by region at this point in time, and it's really not -- it's really not a constructive forecast exercise to try to bring this down into a lower level of detail. So 3% to 4%, still underlying our forecast. We want to grow slightly ahead of that, which is reflected in our guidance range.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Christopher Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey: Hi, good morning. So, just two connected questions on focus and enterprise markets. First, just on the US, you noted that growth was 5%, which is several points ahead of what we can see in the US standard [ph] data. Are there any timing differences with inventory or non-track performance that you would highlight there? And then just tacked on the enterprise market in general. Can you just expand a bit on the acceleration we've seen in these markets? What's driving that uptick in growth? And maybe importantly, how you see relevant performance versus local competitors in these markets, namely if that growth is being driven by pricing and certainly, some of the local competition has different inflation exposures versus that of P&G. So, thanks on the US and the overall enterprise markets.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. To start with the US, we see strong growth in non-covered markets. That's explaining the overall stronger growth. So, just looking at the covered market here is maybe not reflecting the full reality that we've seen in the first quarter. So, broader growth in the US higher than what we've seen in just the covered markets. On the enterprise market side, same dynamic as in the rest of the world, we continue to see strong contribution from pricing, obviously, and the combination of us taking pricing, but driving innovation and priority at the same time, allows us to drive strong organic sales growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is twofold. First, just kind of if you could give a little bit more detail on what needs to happen to get China to sort of -- to get back to mid-single-digit growth beyond, obviously, COVID going away. But my broader question is around competition, your ability to sustain the spending behind the brands given still very tough input costs and obviously, the move in the US dollar. Just kind of curious if you've seen any difference from what competition is doing. Since at the very least international competition since they have the very least don't have the same FX dynamics that you have. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Morning Olivia. China, I think you've answered the question. So, I will leave it there. We will continue to invest. I think our teams are very well set up, but we need consumability to return in order for China to return to mid-single-digit growth. So, I'll leave it at that. In terms of competitive spending, I won't speculate. I think the fact is, obviously, local competitors, as you mentioned, and non-US dollar-denominated competitors, multinational competitors have -- I don't see the same headwinds in terms of foreign exchange. Our strategy continues to double down on our own priority, continue to double down on our own investment. And as Jon said, our commitment to continue to drive Irresistible Superiority is relentless. And that is going to be even more important in some of those market category combinations where we see local or non-US dollar-based competition play.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Lauren's question a while back on trade down. And you said, certainly, you're seeing some trade down within your categories within your brands. And I guess -- two questions. One, are you surprised that there isn't more at this stage even within your brands with inflation and with potential recession. And then two, maybe could you talk about, is there any differences in terms of trade down on what you're seeing in the US versus, say, Europe, Latin America, or is it all fairly, fairly similar? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Hi, Bill. Look, maybe the macro indication of trade down is two-fold. Our value shares in aggregate are holding, as we said, and private label shares, which is the other indicator for a trade down in the market, are growing modestly, both in the US and in Europe. When you look at the US, we see value share for private label increasing 30 basis points over the past three and six months. In Europe, we're looking at about 20 basis points of growth. Some of that is simply driven by supply dynamics. So where in the US, for example, where we see private label growth in our categories would be in bath tissue or in paper towels, where private label in the base period was not supplying well and we kind of picked up that supply over quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year. Now, as private label is in supply and merchandising is reinstated, we see some growth. Encouragingly, when you then look at our Family Care business, sequential share is holding. So there is no direct link of private label growth and us not being able to continue to hold our share position or even expand our share position. Overall, trade down within our portfolio is the design. That's why we have created different value tiers; that\u2019s why we have created different pack sizes. So some level of consumer shifting is expected. We are very encouraged by many of our consumers actually continuing to look for the upper end of our portfolio. And I mentioned the Fabric Care example. Our biggest growth in the Fabric Care share is in the single unit dose segment in the total market, and we're driving that growth. So we're encouraged there. So we see trends in both directions. Part of the consumers continue to look for the upper end of the portfolio. Some consumers who are more exposed from a cash outlay or value standpoint, find a solution within our more value-focused tiers.\nJon Moeller: I think some of the -- I mean, the clearest explanation of all of this, if there is such a thing, in a very complex world is that, value is found at the intersection of price, product performance, as Andre has said, and usage experience. It's not just price. Price is an important component, but those other components are equally important. And as Andre has said several times during the call, we continue to invest heavily in performance and in the usage experience and are hopeful that we can maintain a value proposition for most consumers. Some will, out of necessity trade down. And as Andre said, we have offerings to meet them where they are as well. But I think, again, to cut through this, you have to think about the totality of the value proposition to make sense of what's happening.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess I want to ask about market dynamics for lack of better terms. Maybe start with reconciling global share being in line in terms of what you said on the call with the 7% growth that you reported organically in your 3% to 4% expectations for category growth, right? Obviously, that implies a bit of a deceleration. And then specifically, what's happening in segments that you talked about where there's market contractions. I think you mentioned in the press release, Hair Care, Oral Care, Fabric Care, specifically anything sort of takeaways from there and your expectations and what's driving that going forward?\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Morning Mark. Look, the outlook for the year is still 3% to 4%. This won't be a straight line. The best visibility we have is on the total year at the global level, trying to break this down into quarters or try to break this down as geographies is not helpful in our mind. So, we go quarter-by-quarter. The market growth dynamic by category are not fundamentally different from what we're observing. As I said, the only driver that is visible from a COVID to post-COVID world is in the surface cleaning and hygiene space, where we see a slowdown in the category growth. But other than that, the core drivers that we had predicted to help us deliver market growth is a focus on health and hygiene, more time at home and more focus from consumers on our categories. Our main job here is to drive category growth, and that's what we're really focused on, drive new jobs to be done, drive household penetration where there is potential, drive usage of patients via regimen use, and that's what we're focused on in our innovation and in our communication and in the market execution.\nJon Moeller: And as you think about market and market growth, at some point, the whole market has priced. At some point, that annualizes and it's less of a contributor to topline growth. Yes, volume will hopefully be a partial offset to that. But I think it's normal to expect kind of a reversion to the mean as we get through the pricing cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning and Jon, on your last point, I think just a follow-up on your comments on revenue growth management. I just want to confirm on the timing of this entry-level products hitting the shelves. I know you've done some of it, and which categories you're finding the need to offer Vermont the volume share. I'm assuming Family Care, Baby Care and Laundry Care, I just wanted clarify. And my main question is on what you're embedding in terms of additional pricing in Europe into the second half of fiscal 2023, which I believe is usually when the retailers accept new pricing negotiations. So, what is embedded in your guidance for the back end of the year or the fiscal year at this point. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Hey, Andrea, let me take this. The value tier and price point portfolio that we were describing has been implemented over the past years. So this is not something that we're doing ad hoc in reaction to market dynamics we are observing. This is something that has been part of the strategy for many years. So the introduction of Simply Tide or Tide Simply, the introduction of strengthening of labs, for example. So that has been there for a number of years. Also the strategy of having different opening price points from under $10 to a higher transaction size as has been part of our portfolio for many years. What we're doing carefully as we said all along, is when we price, our price execution is really tailored by SKU by category, by brand, by market. So that's why we pay attention to ensure that as we price, we maintain the right structure on shelf, be that virtual or physical shelf. Again, I can't comment on additional pricing in the second half. As Jon indicated, you would from a market perspective, expect that some pricing annualizes here during the next two quarters, but the situation is still volatile. So we will continue to look at what we're facing and employ a combination of innovation, pricing and productivity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. I guess, coming full circle to the top of the queue and on investment posture. I know that you raised media spend by $1.2 billion from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2022, as you mentioned earlier on the call. But you did start to get leverage on it last year, I think roughly 90 basis points of leverage, and you mentioned more leverage today. So question one is, how do we think about the right investment posture when it comes to advertising and media? And then secondly, Jon mentioned that we're going to see price subside as we anniversary, which obviously we will. In some instances, we'll probably see it subside to because of promotional intensity. And it looks like promotions are building in laundry sequentially, diapers sequentially. And as you mentioned, private labels reengaged in tissue, and that may require some promotional get back. So how do you balance being competitive in market, matching promotional intensity where needed, but yet still getting the price realization you need to cover cost. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. On the media investment, I think we really need to shift focus. It is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend, that is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. So spending reduction might not necessarily correlate with this investment. So we continue to, as Jon said, we committed to drive superiority of our brands. We will not step back from that, and that for us means higher reach, higher quality of reach, higher targeting capability, which we've built around the world, and that's the measure of success for us. If we deliver that, the dollars are an outcome, not the determining factor of efficiency of investment. On the price and promotion side, Jason, we've seen promotion levels come down during COVID, as you know, from above 30% pre-COVID to, I think, 16% was the low during the COVID period. We now see in our categories, promotion coming back up somewhere between 27% to 30%, which is to be expected. For us, the most important element is to use promotions in the right way. If we are able to drive regimen, for example, by co-promoting, co-merchandising, laundry detergent, and fabric enhancers where we have significant penetration opportunities in fabric enhancers, it grows the category, it drives incremental purchase, and it drives repeat of the trial if we do it right. Same is true in Baby Care. When we co-promote wipes with diapers, it drives higher usage in a relatively more underdeveloped category, which is wipes. So, in that sense, promotion can be a driver of growth, market growth, and profit growth, and that's how we want to use it.\nJon Moeller: Just to build on a point that Andre made because the question keeps being raised, which is perfectly fine, but it means we're maybe not being as clear as we can. I'll just give you the example of North America to hopefully give you confidence in our investment posture. We had a discussion with the North American team a couple of weeks ago. Andre was there. I was there. Charles was there. And they had prepared perspective by category on dollar spend versus a year ago. And I walked into the room and said, this isn't helpful. What we need to understand is what are our reach objectives and are we sufficient and spending to achieve those reach objectives, what are our objectives in terms of number of weeks on air achieving that reach. And that's how we'll measure sufficiency. Now, I want to do that. We want to do that as cost effectively as possible. But that's the plan, and we went through an insured that category-by-category, we had sufficient reach and we had sufficient weeks of media and where we determine that we might not, then there was a discussion with the business leaders on what we could do to ensure that, that happened. So, we're spending a fair amount of time on this. We're very committed to it. And it's -- I'm sure it's frustrating because you don't have visibility to all of that. You just have visibility to the dollars, which I completely understand. As Andre also said, one other dynamic is we're moving a lot of the marketing activity set in-house. And so the cost for that in terms of, for example, purchasing media moves out of the advertising budget and into the overhead budget. So, that also affects the spend period-to-period. Hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much. Two easy ones, I think. First, I want to understand the bridge between the global pricing impact as cited at 470 basis points and global pricing of 9%. I'm sure it's easy I'm missing that. I just want to understand how that math works as we go forward. And secondly, you mentioned pantry inventories. I wonder, is there any data you have specifically about monitoring that in a granular way on a global basis or at least maybe some anecdotes about how that's worked in the past when we've seen periods of rising pricing and a little bit of elasticity. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: On the pricing to gross margin reconciliation, I suggest you go back to our IR team for them to give you the math off-line. On the pantry inventory, we do have some data. We have in-home consumer data, specifically in the US and many other markets that allows us to see their relative pantry inventory. So, it's based on that observation in the market. But it's not illogical to assume that high inventories that were built during the COVID phase, for example, in bath tissue and paper towels slowly drawing down. I would tell you that we're still seeing somewhat higher levels than we've seen pre-COVID, but none of this is material. It's more an element of consumer behavior we're observing. So, it's nothing that would stand out in terms of the construct of the market growth or forecast.\nJon Moeller: Hey just one thing as we wrap this up, and I'll turn it back to Andre. If you step back from all of this -- as I step back from all of this, I am just incredibly pleased with our team and what they've accomplished. 7% organic sales growth against the context of Russia, Ukraine, what's happened in China where the market is down mid-singles, that is truly a fantastic work; communicating the value of our offerings, improving the value of our offerings as we take necessary pricing, maintaining topline momentum of the business, great work. The other piece that I that I think portends a strong future is the work, as Andre mentioned at the onset of the call that's happening on productivity. Between commodities, FX, and warehousing and transportation, we had a 32-point negative AT impact on the quarter, and this team was able to offset 30 points of that 32 through the combination of pricing and productivity. So, that's the big picture, in my view, and I couldn't be happier.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Only point to add is and the combination of value shareholding globally and in the US is a strong indication in our mind that the strategy of driving superiority even in inflationary environment is the right strategy for P&G. So, we'll continue to double down, as we said in our opening remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAndre Schulten: With that, I just want to remind you quickly that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here in Cincinnati on the afternoon and evening of Thursday, November 17th. You should have received the registration e-mail in early September. If you didn't receive it and would like to attend, please get in touch with John and our IR team. Thank you for your time and have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Hey, Steve, this is Jon. I agree with everything that Andre said, just one additional short comment. If we find ourselves, which we don't currently, in a position where we have to choose between investing in the business and delivering a bottom line target, we will invest in the business. Good morning, Lauren. Yes, as you stated in your question, we seeing global value share and value share in the US holding, which is a great signal to our strategies working of providing value to consumers via innovation, as we price contribution of 9% on the quarter, with volume being down 3%, but the majority of that volume, so more than two points actually driven by Russia. Also is a good indication that the strategy of irresistible superiority works even in an inflationary environment where we need to take pricing. The US specifically, as you mentioned, our all outlet share is flat. We've seen strong growth in the US of 5%. There is some volume reduction, as you would expect, with the price increase and inflationary pressures, we see volume contracting by about a point or two and that is consumer behavior around entry inventory reduction, stretching purchasing cycles, and maybe being a bit more careful in terms of dosing. But overall, we're still able to grow sales within the market and hold share within the market at this point. To specifically talk to some of the categories you mentioned and maybe consumer behavior there. We talked about our fabric care situation in the last earnings call, where we were supply constrained on some of the portfolio in quarter three and quarter four of last fiscal year. We had reduced media spending and have reduced merchandising support stretching into quarter one of this fiscal year. And that certainly has resulted in some share pressure, which you would have seen in the xAOC shares. We feel very good about the team being able to reinstate supply to full efficiency. They have also reinstated media. They have reinstated merger support and strengthened merger support, and we're seeing our Fabric Care business coming back. Our volume share in the most recent read is actually up. We see continued strong growth on single unit dose, where the majority of the market growth is, and we're driving that market growth. In terms of consumer sentiment, in general, we see part of the consumer base in Fabric Care, for example, trending up, as I mentioned, into single unit dose. We see some growth also in our mid-tier brands as consumers are looking for value within our portfolio. They're trading into game, or into simply tied, for example, where we see some level of share growth. And that's the intent of our vertical portfolio, and our strategy to provide different value tiers to consumers. We are also seeing consumers moving two different price points. So a group of consumers is looking for value by trading into higher transaction sizes, to find lower cost per use by lower cost per unit, and we see other consumers who are more cash conscious, and they are very focused on cash outlay. So again, the other part of the strategy to provide pack sizes that stretch from below $10 for some channels and consumers to above $30 or $40 for others seems to be meeting consumers needs. So broadly, we feel good about the position we're in. There are some dynamics in terms of supply and base period that will be with us for a period of time. We remain supply constrained on a few categories, where we will see share pressure. Tampons, for example, the premium tier of our Fem Care pets business and on some health \u2013 some side of the health care business. But overall, we don't see any negative reaction, and we feel reconfirmed in our strategy by what we see in consumers' behavior. I think some of the -- I mean, the clearest explanation of all of this, if there is such a thing, in a very complex world is that, value is found at the intersection of price, product performance, as Andre has said, and usage experience. It's not just price. Price is an important component, but those other components are equally important. And as Andre has said several times during the call, we continue to invest heavily in performance and in the usage experience and are hopeful that we can maintain a value proposition for most consumers. Some will, out of necessity trade down. And as Andre said, we have offerings to meet them where they are as well. But I think, again, to cut through this, you have to think about the totality of the value proposition to make sense of what's happening. And as you think about market and market growth, at some point, the whole market has priced. At some point, that annualizes and it's less of a contributor to topline growth. Yes, volume will hopefully be a partial offset to that. But I think it's normal to expect kind of a reversion to the mean as we get through the pricing cycle. Just to build on a point that Andre made because the question keeps being raised, which is perfectly fine, but it means we're maybe not being as clear as we can. I'll just give you the example of North America to hopefully give you confidence in our investment posture. We had a discussion with the North American team a couple of weeks ago. Andre was there.

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the July to September quarter and provides a solid start to the fiscal year. We're growing organic sales in all 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, accelerating productivity savings, and improving supply sufficiency. Together, this progress enables us to maintain guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Despite continued high commodity and transportation costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. Moving to the first quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 7%, pricing added 9 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 3 points, primarily due to lower shipments in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens. Feminine Care was up double digits. Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up mid-singles. Family Care and Oral Care grew low single digits. Focus markets grew 4% for the quarter, with the US up 5%. Greater China organic sales were down 4% versus the prior year, modest sequential improvement in the market still affected by COVID lockdowns and weak consumer confidence. Longer term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 16% with each of the three regions, up 13% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year, with 26 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was in line with prior year with 6 of 10 categories holding or growing shares. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.57, down 2% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 7%. Core margin decreased 160 basis points and currency-neutral core margin was down 130 basis points.  Higher commodity materials and freight cost impacts combined with a 550 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 120-point headwinds, productivity savings and pricing provided 580 basis points of offset. SG&A costs as a percentage of sales were lower by 90 basis points as sales leverage and productivity improvements more than offset inflation and foreign exchange impacts.  Core operating margin decreased 70 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin increased 10 basis points, productivity improvements were a 230 basis help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 86%, we returned nearly $6.3 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $4 billion share repurchase.  In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrating strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, which are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation.  A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. The priority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.  Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments is a priority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future especially important in this volatile environment.  Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build the priority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Jon touched on each of these in our July earnings call and they will be a central part of our discussion at Investor Day in November.  Our strategic choices on portfolios, priority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, when executed well, they grow markets, which in-turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.  Now moving on to guidance, we fully expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence has positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation have remained high since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices at latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.4 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs have also remained high. Though we have seen some easing in spot prices, we've made a modest downward adjustment in our outlook and now expect a $200 million after-tax headwind on freight and transportation costs in fiscal 2023. Foreign exchange has continued its strong move against us as the US dollar has strengthened significantly against essentially all major currencies around the world. Based on current exchange rates, we forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact, an incremental hit of $400 million versus our initial outlook for the year. Combined, headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.9 billion after tax or $1.57 a share, a 27 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. We will offset a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We will continue to invest in irresistible superiority, which is even more important as we compete in some markets with local or non-US based competitors that don't see the same foreign exchange rate impact. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. As I noted at the outset, our good first quarter results enable us to confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year, across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%. On the bottom line, we are maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of in line plus 4% versus prior year. However, the steep increase in foreign exchange impact pushes our current expectations towards the lower end of the range. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. The outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, the macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't immune to the impact. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward towards the opportunities that we may fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Yes. Good morning, Steve. Let me maybe start with productivity to reassure you on the ability to deliver significant productivity and then I'll turn it into the discussion on investments. We have increased our productivity numbers for the year back to pre-COVID levels. So we have good visibility to a significant step up versus what we were able to do during COVID, where we had to limit our productivity efforts to some degree to benefit innovation and shipping cases. With line time being available, we have now full ability to qualify those cost savings on the line. We have built digital capabilities to increase the speed of reformulation to drive superiority at lower cost. We have increased our ability to qualify new supply chains, if necessary, in order to reduce cost. We're improving the capability of our working teams and the plans to drive more efficient operations there. And we are constantly looking at our end-to-end supply chain, including logistics to drive costs out. And we feel very good about our continued efforts to drive cost of goods productivity. We'll talk more about that as we discuss Supply Chain 3.0. But the runway is there. The capabilities are there and we're seeing the visibility on the fiscal year results. On the media side, we also feel very good about our ability to drive continued investment in reach and quality of reach and better targeting while being able to flow productivity dollars to the bottom line to help offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the US or in Europe, but around the world. And that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach, while increasing quality of reach, and while more precisely targeting our consumers. Over the past three years, we have significantly increased spend in media by more than $1.2 billion. That's on top of the productivity we have generated over those years and on top of sales leverage. So we're also starting, I would argue from a very rich support plan for our brands. In terms of reinvestment of those savings and reinvestment of those savings reinvestment of those savings reinvestment capability within the P&L construct, we are not deprioritizing innovation. We will not deprioritize innovation. Every innovation that we've delivered in the market has created value and has continued to create value and contribute to our results. And in the overall results, we see that our approach of driving superiority is actually the strongest driver of our ability to limit volume impact, all pricing moves enable us to continue to price and deliver value to the consumer. So in aggregate, I think the team has full confidence that we can balance what we see, but it will require careful balance and doubling down on productivity to sustain innovation and investment in our group. Good morning Dara. The guidance of 3% to 5% is really grounded in what we believe the market will be. We see some softening in the market as we have communicated, about 3% to 4% value growth is what we're expecting the market to be. We want to grow slightly ahead of that. As you say, the first quarter gives us a good level of confidence that we're within the right range, but we're also very early in the year. So, we believe -- confirming the range is prudent. In terms of volume elasticity in my earlier remarks, as I said, we feel very encouraged by the fact that we were able to realize 9% of pricing in organic sales growth and effectively only see about a point of reduction in volume, which speaks to favorable elasticities speaks to our strategy working and providing consumers value with innovation even as we take pricing. As we always do, we assume that these elasticities return to historical levels over time. But certainly, the first quarter is a good indication. It gives us confidence that the approach we've taken around the world in terms of combining pricing with innovation and productivity in order to offset the cost is the right approach. Good morning Bryan. I can't speculate or give you an answer on future pricing. We adjust in the execution of the second pricing round for many of our brands. We took pricing on all our categories in the last fiscal year, covering about 80% of sales. We're now in the second round covering about 85% of sales and that's what we see flowing through in the first quarter. Many of these price increases in the second round are being executed in September and October. For the future, we will continue to observe where our cost headwinds go where foreign exchange rate goes. It's a very dynamic environment. We will continue to carefully balance innovation, pricing, and productivity. Yeah. Good morning, Kaumil. Look, the commodity cost increases are broad-based and different by commodity class. So, for example, we continue to see pulp increase. There is some relief on propylene and ethylene. But, in aggregate, we are not seeing broad enough relief on the input side to offset some of the inflation that is also coming from our suppliers. We call -- we don't buy propylene. We don't buy ethylene. We buy packaging materials. We buy super absorbers and materials that are secondary to that direct commodity impact. And that inflation is included in our $2.4 billion commodity headwind. So relatively stable on the commodity side. On the freight side, transportation and warehousing, as mentioned in the opening comments, we see some easing and we expect about $100 million less in headwinds, so $200 million after tax, down from $300 million. You see that market getting more back to [Audio Gap] contract prices as well. So that's been reflected. And then foreign exchange rate, obviously, is broadly across all currencies as the US dollar strengthens really around every currency in the world. And that's where we have bigger increase versus our initial guidance range about $400 million due to the ForEx effects that we've described. Good morning, Rob. Yes, post-COVID behavior, what I would point to, obviously, is we see market contraction versus the pandemic phase in terms of antibacterial surface cleaning products, which is a small part of our total portfolio. Other than that, I wouldn't point to any major deviation from what we expected. Consumers still spend more time at home. I think, generally, the focus on our categories, which are cleaning, hygiene, health based continues to be high, which is, I think, playing back in our investments in Superiority being meaningful to consumers in order to provide value in an inflationary environment. The other element that is positive is some of the volatility might be disappearing. So when you think about categories like bath tissue or paper towels, where we had very volatile base periods with suppliers being in and out of supply over quarter three -- quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year, that is stabilizing. So, those are the post-COVID dynamics. That obviously doesn't play for China to transition to your second part of the question. We continue to see the lockdowns in China specifically with Hainan being locked down for the last two months to impact consumption significantly. Volumes in China are down 5% to 6% on the quarter. We had certainly hoped for that to ease, but we still see significant negative impact on consumer mobility from the continued strength COVID policies. We don't -- going forward, we made no assumption on that changing. So, we have to observe where the market is going. We feel well-positioned. Once we see consumer mobility return, we feel very strongly about our ability to grow in the market. We have a strong team on the ground waiting to get going once the market fully reopens. And as we said before, we expect China to be a long-term growth driver returning to mid-single-digit growth here in the near future. Operator, do we have the next question? Yes. Morning Nik. As you know, we generally orient our outlook on what we know today in terms of foreign exchange rate dynamics, in terms of commodity costs, in terms of energy costs. So that's what is built into our reconfirmed guidance range. When you look at the consumer side and the market side, obviously, we see high pressure on the European consumer, with high inflation and certainly, as the energy costs will hit the consumer over the winter period, depending on how much support from the European governments provided and when we need to be extra careful in terms of ensuring that consumers have appropriate access to our portfolio, making sure that we give the right value to them via superiority, strong innovation, the right price letter the right value tier offerings. So we expect Europe to be tough from a consumer environment standpoint, but well positioned from our portfolio standpoint in order to be able to compete in that market. The same is true for the US. We continue to focus with our retail partners to have broad access across our portfolio for consumers, so they can make the right choices. As we said before, price ladder is increasingly important, cash outlay choices are increasingly important, and that's what we'll continue to focus on. Enterprise markets are holding up well. And that's a key growth driver also in the quarter. You've seen all enterprise markets grow mid-teens and even LA growing at 23%. So we'll continue to drive the same strategy in enterprise markets of providing superiority pricing and productivity. Yes. Kevin, we expect a slowdown from the growth rate we've seen over the past years, which was 5% to a more modest 3% to 4%. That is still the case. We continue to believe that the majority of that growth will be price driven with a negative volume component, as you would expect given the inflationary pressure. We don't have more detail by region at this point in time, and it's really not -- it's really not a constructive forecast exercise to try to bring this down into a lower level of detail. So 3% to 4%, still underlying our forecast. We want to grow slightly ahead of that, which is reflected in our guidance range. Yes. To start with the US, we see strong growth in non-covered markets. That's explaining the overall stronger growth. So, just looking at the covered market here is maybe not reflecting the full reality that we've seen in the first quarter. So, broader growth in the US higher than what we've seen in just the covered markets. On the enterprise market side, same dynamic as in the rest of the world, we continue to see strong contribution from pricing, obviously, and the combination of us taking pricing, but driving innovation and priority at the same time, allows us to drive strong organic sales growth. Yes. Morning Olivia. China, I think you've answered the question. So, I will leave it there. We will continue to invest. I think our teams are very well set up, but we need consumability to return in order for China to return to mid-single-digit growth. So, I'll leave it at that. In terms of competitive spending, I won't speculate. I think the fact is, obviously, local competitors, as you mentioned, and non-US dollar-denominated competitors, multinational competitors have -- I don't see the same headwinds in terms of foreign exchange. Our strategy continues to double down on our own priority, continue to double down on our own investment. And as Jon said, our commitment to continue to drive Irresistible Superiority is relentless. And that is going to be even more important in some of those market category combinations where we see local or non-US dollar-based competition play. Yes. Hi, Bill. Look, maybe the macro indication of trade down is two-fold. Our value shares in aggregate are holding, as we said, and private label shares, which is the other indicator for a trade down in the market, are growing modestly, both in the US and in Europe. When you look at the US, we see value share for private label increasing 30 basis points over the past three and six months. In Europe, we're looking at about 20 basis points of growth. Some of that is simply driven by supply dynamics. So where in the US, for example, where we see private label growth in our categories would be in bath tissue or in paper towels, where private label in the base period was not supplying well and we kind of picked up that supply over quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year. Now, as private label is in supply and merchandising is reinstated, we see some growth. Encouragingly, when you then look at our Family Care business, sequential share is holding. So there is no direct link of private label growth and us not being able to continue to hold our share position or even expand our share position. Overall, trade down within our portfolio is the design. That's why we have created different value tiers; that's why we have created different pack sizes. So some level of consumer shifting is expected. We are very encouraged by many of our consumers actually continuing to look for the upper end of our portfolio. And I mentioned the Fabric Care example. Our biggest growth in the Fabric Care share is in the single unit dose segment in the total market, and we're driving that growth. So we're encouraged there. So we see trends in both directions. Part of the consumers continue to look for the upper end of the portfolio. Some consumers who are more exposed from a cash outlay or value standpoint, find a solution within our more value-focused tiers. Yes. Morning Mark. Look, the outlook for the year is still 3% to 4%. This won't be a straight line. The best visibility we have is on the total year at the global level, trying to break this down into quarters or try to break this down as geographies is not helpful in our mind. So, we go quarter-by-quarter. The market growth dynamic by category are not fundamentally different from what we're observing. As I said, the only driver that is visible from a COVID to post-COVID world is in the surface cleaning and hygiene space, where we see a slowdown in the category growth. But other than that, the core drivers that we had predicted to help us deliver market growth is a focus on health and hygiene, more time at home and more focus from consumers on our categories. Our main job here is to drive category growth, and that's what we're really focused on, drive new jobs to be done, drive household penetration where there is potential, drive usage of patients via regimen use, and that's what we're focused on in our innovation and in our communication and in the market execution. Yes. Hey, Andrea, let me take this. The value tier and price point portfolio that we were describing has been implemented over the past years. So this is not something that we're doing ad hoc in reaction to market dynamics we are observing. This is something that has been part of the strategy for many years. So the introduction of Simply Tide or Tide Simply, the introduction of strengthening of labs, for example. So that has been there for a number of years. Also the strategy of having different opening price points from under $10 to a higher transaction size as has been part of our portfolio for many years. What we're doing carefully as we said all along, is when we price, our price execution is really tailored by SKU by category, by brand, by market. So that's why we pay attention to ensure that as we price, we maintain the right structure on shelf, be that virtual or physical shelf. Again, I can't comment on additional pricing in the second half. As Jon indicated, you would from a market perspective, expect that some pricing annualizes here during the next two quarters, but the situation is still volatile. So we will continue to look at what we're facing and employ a combination of innovation, pricing and productivity. Yes. On the media investment, I think we really need to shift focus. It is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend, that is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. So spending reduction might not necessarily correlate with this investment. So we continue to, as Jon said, we committed to drive superiority of our brands. We will not step back from that, and that for us means higher reach, higher quality of reach, higher targeting capability, which we've built around the world, and that's the measure of success for us. If we deliver that, the dollars are an outcome, not the determining factor of efficiency of investment. On the price and promotion side, Jason, we've seen promotion levels come down during COVID, as you know, from above 30% pre-COVID to, I think, 16% was the low during the COVID period. We now see in our categories, promotion coming back up somewhere between 27% to 30%, which is to be expected. For us, the most important element is to use promotions in the right way. If we are able to drive regimen, for example, by co-promoting, co-merchandising, laundry detergent, and fabric enhancers where we have significant penetration opportunities in fabric enhancers, it grows the category, it drives incremental purchase, and it drives repeat of the trial if we do it right. Same is true in Baby Care. When we co-promote wipes with diapers, it drives higher usage in a relatively more underdeveloped category, which is wipes. So, in that sense, promotion can be a driver of growth, market growth, and profit growth, and that's how we want to use it. On the pricing to gross margin reconciliation, I suggest you go back to our IR team for them to give you the math off-line. On the pantry inventory, we do have some data. We have in-home consumer data, specifically in the US and many other markets that allows us to see their relative pantry inventory. So, it's based on that observation in the market. But it's not illogical to assume that high inventories that were built during the COVID phase, for example, in bath tissue and paper towels slowly drawing down. I would tell you that we're still seeing somewhat higher levels than we've seen pre-COVID, but none of this is material. It's more an element of consumer behavior we're observing. So, it's nothing that would stand out in terms of the construct of the market growth or forecast. Yes. Only point to add is and the combination of value shareholding globally and in the US is a strong indication in our mind that the strategy of driving superiority even in inflationary environment is the right strategy for P&G. So, we'll continue to double down, as we said in our opening remarks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s quarter end conference call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of results for fiscal year \u201924 and for the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal \u201925 and then take your questions. Fiscal \u201924 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies enabled the company to meet or exceed going-in guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners, all this despite significant market level headwinds that were largely unknown when we gave our initial outlook for the year. Organic sales growth for the fiscal year was 4%, our sixth consecutive year of 4% or better organic growth against a strong 7% comp in the prior year and in more challenging market conditions. Growth was broad-based across business units with eight of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care, hair care and grooming were up high single digits, oral care and feminine care up mid singles. Fabric care, family care, and personal healthcare grew low single digits. Skin and personal care and baby care were down low singles. Focus markets grew 4% for the year with North America up 5% and Europe focus markets up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down 9% versus the prior year, driven by soft market conditions and brand-specific headwinds on SK-II. Enterprise markets were up 6%, led by Latin America with 15% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 9%, now representing 18% of the total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth continues to drive share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew around 5% in fiscal \u201924. P&G consumption grew ahead of our fair share of category growth, driving modest value and volume share growth for the year. We grew global aggregate value share. Thirty of 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Six of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $6.59, up 12% for the year. Core gross margin improved 360 basis points and core operating margin increased 170 basis points. Over $2.3 billion of productivity improvements were enabled by a significant increase in investment in superior products, packages and brand communication to drive market growth. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 16% and core operating margin increased 250 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%. We increased our dividend by 7% and returned over $14 billion of value to share owners, $9.3 billion in dividends, and $5 billion in share repurchase. Moving onto fourth quarter results, organic sales rounded down to 2%, volume was up 2%, solid sequential progress. Pricing was up 1% and mix was in line with prior year. Growth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions. Nine of 10 product categories grew or held organic sales in the quarter. Home care, hair care, grooming and oral care were each up high single digits, feminine care up low singles, skin and personal care, fabric care, personal health care and family care were each in line with prior year, and baby care was down mid singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 2% and enterprise markets up 2% for the quarter. Organic sales in North America grew 4% with four points of volume growth and price mix, in line with prior year. European focus markets organic sales were up 2% against a strong 12% comp in the base period. Volume was up 3%. Price mix was down a point as the region has now fully annualized prior year inflation-driven pricing. Latin America organic sales were up 8%, including high singles growth in Brazil. Of note, Argentina\u2019s overall contribution to organic sales for the region and the company were lower than the last two quarters due to the divestiture of a portion of the business in March and a notable decline in shipment volume for the remaining categories. As was announced earlier this month, we have divested the remaining portions of our operations in Argentina. As a result, Argentina will be largely removed from our organic sales reporting in fiscal year \u201925. Select P&G brands will still be available in the market through a distribution and licensing agreement with the new owner of the operations. Greater China organic sales declined 8%. Underlying market conditions have remained weak and the 6/18 key consumption period was down sharply versus prior year, just as we saw in the 11/11 Chinese New Year and Valentine\u2019s Day shopping periods. Also, brand-specific headwinds have continued on SK-II due to its Japanese heritage. We expect general market trends and the dynamics related to SK-II to improve over time, though it will likely be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia have remained soft. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Global aggregate market share was down 30 basis points as we are now annualizing very strong growth in European-focused markets. Twenty-five of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.40, up 2% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 6%. Core gross margin increased 140 basis points and core operating margin decreased 100 basis points. Strong productivity improvements of 250 basis points, funding a meaningful increase in marketing investment, currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 148%. We returned nearly $4 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, over $2.4 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year: organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash productivity and cash returns to share owners, strong performance again this year in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jon.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Andre. I\u2019ll start with a few thoughts on results before discussing the strategy. Our team continues to execute the strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past six years pre-COVID, during COVID, through a historic inflationary and a pricing cycle, and through geopolitical tensions. Organic sales growth of plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, and plus-4 over the last fiscal years. Strong earnings growth and growth in operating margin expansion. Very strong cash generation and over $96 billion of cash returned to share owners over those six years. For fiscal \u201924, going-in organic sales guidance was 4% to 5%. We delivered 4% in a very volatile environment. Flat volume for the year with improving trajectory through the year, 2% growth in the fourth quarter. Strong volume growth in North America and Europe focus markets offsetting soft markets in enterprise regions in China. Going-in core EPS guidance of 6% to 9%, delivered 12%. Core gross margin at a 17-year high with strong productivity improvement funding strong marketing investments. Going-in cash productivity outlook of 90%, delivered 105% which enabled a 7% dividend increase, the 68th consecutive year of increase and the 134th consecutive year paying a dividend. As Andre said, strong results in a challenging environment. To be very clear, there\u2019s still more work to do to continue improving areas in our control, which will be needed to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control. We\u2019ll double down on superiority across all five vectors. We\u2019ll double down on productivity up and down the P&L and across the balance sheet. We\u2019ll double down on enabling our organization to execute our integrated strategy with excellence, to delight consumers and win in the marketplace, to deliver the level of balanced growth and value creation results you and we expect. Our strategy is dynamic and sustainable. It adapts to the changing needs of consumers, customers and society and is focused on growing markets, creating versus taking business, the most sustainable and typically most profitable way to grow. A focused portfolio of daily use products and categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies. As you know, we are active managers of our portfolio. Over the last several years, we have made some targeted additions and subtractions in that portfolio. We have adjusted our operating model in several markets. Each of these moves were made with a focus on long term balanced growth and value creation. The second strategy element, ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to delight consumers, grow markets and our share in them, to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights, communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands and priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. We\u2019ve talked many times about the superiority driven market growth, share growth, and sales growth we\u2019ve achieved with products like Tide and Ariel pods, Downy and Lenor laundry scent beads, and Dawn and Fairy easy squeeze and power wash. Two more examples: Oral B IO power toothbrushes deliver superior cleaning and delightful user experience. Superior communication includes the insight that manual brushes leave 50% of plaque behind, but Oral B IO delivers 100% more plaque bacterial removal with its round head and removes plaque in hard to reach places. This superior proposition is accelerating power brush trial and adoption, bringing new power brush users into the category, driving high single digit market growth of the power brush category, double digit sales growth for Oral B power, and two points of Oral B value share growth over the past 12 months. Native, our premium personal care brand is delivering superiority across all five vectors and across multiple product forms, including deodorants, body wash, shampoo and conditioners, superior performance with fewer ingredients and irresistible scents. Transparent labeling and clean white packaging, superior retail execution and strong retailer partnerships showcasing the full range of forms and scents. Premium positioning with the category providing superior value for the consumer looking for an offering with more natural ingredients. Native has driven a step change in market value growth for the U.S. deodorants and personal care categories from low singles to mid teens. Native sales have grown nearly 10 times over the last five years to over $700 million in fiscal \u201924. Third strategy element, productivity improvement in all areas of our operations. In order to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth to mitigate cost and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash. We delivered very strong cost savings in fiscal \u201924. Visibility to more savings opportunities is increasing as the businesses continue to build their three-year rolling productivity master plans. We have an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chains 3.0. We\u2019re working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain end to end versus simply trying to optimize our respective pieces. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We\u2019re also using digital tools to optimize fill rates and for our dynamic routing and sourcing optimization. $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity. More efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We\u2019re taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We\u2019re disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we\u2019ve designed and continued to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization, an inclusive and diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. Strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas that we\u2019ve outlined previously. Number one, supply chain 3.0, it\u2019s delivering productivity, as you can see in the results. We\u2019re also driving improved agility, flexibility, scalability and transparency in a rapidly evolving landscape. Optimized sustainable and flexible up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strength what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners in third party industry surveys. Next, environmental sustainability. Superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are more sustainable. Driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. The next focus area is digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers , streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving share owner value. One example is the improvement we\u2019ve delivered in ad copy qualification and media buying with proprietary digital tools we\u2019ve developed and the digital molecule development work in fabric care. We\u2019ve built similar tools to drive faster, cheaper and better innovation in perfume, which benefits almost every product category in the company. We\u2019re also digitizing more of our back office work processes to lower costs and drive efficiencies while delivering higher quality output. Each of these examples has obvious cost benefits, but they\u2019re also driving product and package superiority, superior brand communication to consumers, superior retail execution in store and online, stronger internal controls and jobs that enable people to focus on higher order tasks with greater business impact. Last focus area, a superior value equation for all employees, for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not separate strategies, they simply strengthen our ability to execute our integrated growth strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption of our organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe there\u2019s merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth in value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. I believe in the capabilities and commitment of P&G people to serve consumers and to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G\u2019s values and principles. I\u2019m excited about what lays ahead. Of course we\u2019ll continue to face challenges, but the future holds great promise. We have many opportunities ahead to grow markets, grow our business, and create significant value for our owners. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year.\nAndre Schulten: Thank you Jon. As we enter fiscal \u201925, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from input costs, currencies, to consumers, competitors, retailers, and geopolitical dynamics. As Jon said, we\u2019ll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers every step of the way. Our going-in guidance for fiscal \u201925 is consistent with our long term algorithm. On the top line, we currently expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. Our objective is to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth in these markets. This translates to an organic sales growth guidance range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal year - apologies, I had my mic muted. On the bottom line, our algorithm calls for mid to high single digit core earnings per share growth. Our core EPS guidance range for fiscal \u201925 starts the year at 5% to 7% versus fiscal \u201924 core EPS of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, $6.98 up 6% at the center of the range. This outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $300 million after tax and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $200 million after tax. Combined, foreign exchange and commodities are projected to be a headwind of $0.20 per share for fiscal \u201925, or a 3 percentage point drag on core EPS growth. In addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from several minor brand divestitures, and we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $7 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. While we are clear eyed on the challenges in the market and the work needed to continue to drive the business, fiscal \u201925 guidance for top line, bottom line and cash are each consistent with our long term algorithm. A few items for you to consider as you build your quarter-to-quarter estimates. On the top line, please keep in mind that the July to September period has the most difficult comp for the year, and many of the market-level challenges we\u2019ve noted will not fully annualize or improve materially in our estimate until the second half of the year. On the bottom line, the foreign exchange and commodity headwinds skew a bit toward the front half of the year, and the back half comps include the benefit of the tax items and minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts.\nJon Moeller: We\u2019re very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered over the last year and inclusive of prior years in a very challenging and volatile environment. The earnings power and value creation potential of the company are as strong as ever. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks Operator, and good morning everyone. I guess the question that we\u2019ve fielded a few times this morning, and if you could touch on this a bit, the last couple of quarters, it seems like organic sales have come in maybe slower or lower than expected--than you were expecting at the start of each quarter, so maybe if you can touch a little bit on just what\u2019s developed, especially in the fourth quarter, maybe different than what you were expecting, and then if you can add to that also, is that true for the market? At a 2% organic sales for this quarter, are we above, below, or in line with market growth? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Morning Bryan. I\u2019ll start and then Jon, I\u2019m sure, will add some perspective as well. I\u2019ll start back where we kind of started the prepared remarks. I think we delivered a year where we exceeded on that, all of our in-going guidance metrics. Now, the year wasn\u2019t linear, as you highlight, and I\u2019d distinguish two parts of the business. Eighty-five percent of the business is performing right in line with expectations, and right in line with what we would have expected throughout the year. We have strong growth in North America, 4% in the quarter, 4% volume growth in the quarter. Europe focus markets growing volumes at 3%, Europe enterprise markets growing volumes at 6%, LA normalizing to about 8% organic sales growth, so that\u2019s part of the business where the trajectory is not impacted by significant external events. I think it\u2019s moving right along. We expected the normalization and price-mix contribution, as we have talked throughout the quarters. If you look at the headwinds that we started to communicate in December, they are really still with us in--throughout the second half, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the volatility in the top line results. Those headwinds have accelerated in part, and honestly in quarter four, some of them developed late in the quarter, so when you think about China and SK-II, we\u2019re heavily impacted by 6/18, a weaker key consumption period in China, and overall market sentiment in China has not improved throughout H2. We had highlighted that we expect the China recovery to be slow and to take time, and I think that\u2019s playing out in the results we see in the second half. The Middle East situation has not really improved, so we continue to see developing stronger impacts on western retailers in some of these markets, and while the team has implemented many interventions, the execution in-store has been limited by some of these headwinds in the Middle East. The last element, we saw a softening in quarter four on the Argentina volumes driven by the general circumstances in the market, strong high translation pricing in Argentina, so there was a softer contribution on organic sales growth in quarter four than what we\u2019d seen in quarter three. If you step back, though, the performance of the business and the way we set up for \u201925, I think is very strong. Eighty five of the business is developing right in line with what we would have expected. We\u2019re growing share in North America. The balance of the markets are growing volume, which is really the shift we needed to see. Our gross margin is at record levels. Our productivity is very strong. That has enabled us to remain fully invested from a media perspective and from an innovation perspective, and so going into the year, we feel all the structural elements of the business are strong. Now, what is important to understand, and we mentioned it in the prepared remarks, those headwinds that we have experienced in H2 will still be with us in H1 of this fiscal year, so we expect this year not to be linear and we have to accelerate sales growth throughout the quarters as some of these headwinds annualize and we return to growth. But overall, I think we\u2019re well set up to deliver against the guidance metrics we just communicated.\nJon Moeller: I agree with everything that Andre just said. I would remind you relative to the comment of performing versus our own expectations, precisely because of the volatility of the world that we all live and operate in, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, we only provide annual guidance, and as Andre said, we met our beat, each of those numbers that were provided. There have been two primary questions that have been--that we\u2019ve all been working through. One is can we re-accelerate volume, and as Andre said, that is broadly happening and impressively so. If you look at North America over the course of the fiscal year, plus-3, plus-3, plus-4, plus-3. If we look at Europe, plus-2, plus-3, plus-4, plus-2. Andre gave you figures for some of the other regions, but broadly that question f can volume be re-accelerated is answered with an emphatic yes. The second question that at least we\u2019ve been working through is, can that happen in the context of continued margin expansion? If you look at the fiscal year numbers, top line to bottom line that\u2019s definitely happened. If you look at gross margin in the quarter we just completed, which comes in at a 17-year high, we\u2019re certainly able to continue to re-accelerate volume growth while holding or building margins. Like Andre, I approach next year in a realistic fashion and realizing that the first couple quarters are going to look a little bit more like the one we just completed, but with overall a belief that the fundamentals of the business are in very strong shape and that as we bring the innovation that\u2019s planned to market throughout the fiscal year, we\u2019re going to be happy with the results in line with the guidance that he\u2019s provided. One other element of the strength and health of the business fundamentally, if you look at the last fiscal year at a brand level, 21 out of 25 brands were growing. Eleven of those 25 brands were growing at high single digits or higher rates, so again from a breadth standpoint, I think we\u2019re positioned very well and the team\u2019s doing a great job.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. I actually just wanted to follow up on those last two points you made, Jon. On the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for fiscal \u201925, can you just parse out a bit more detail in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the balance between pricing and volume? I know you won\u2019t want to be exact, but how you\u2019re thinking about that and the 3% to 4% category growth assumption, do you think there\u2019s good visibility there given the slowing pricing, and then if you bless me with a Part B, I guess just how do you think about earnings flex relative to top line, given some of the top line volatility, obviously significant year-over-year gross margin expansion in fiscal \u201924 but that\u2019s been dissipating, you boosted marketing a lot, you\u2019ve got strong productivity, as you mentioned, so there\u2019s a lot going on sort of in the margin line items, so just how do you think about earnings flex next year relative to top line growth, given some of this volatility? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Dara. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Andre to take us through some of the details, and then I\u2019ll round out the answer. Go ahead, Andre.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, thanks for the question, Dara. The volume versus price mix contribution is expected to be broadly balanced. We expected markets to return to more sustainable growth rates of 3% to 4% - that is largely happening now, and if you look at the construction of that market growth, about half of that is driven by volume, the other half is driven by price mix. I would expect our construct to look similar for the fiscal year. Obviously it will differ by quarter and front half versus back half, but broadly balanced between volume and price mix. On the margin perspective, you saw us make a choice to continue to invest fully in the business. We have delivered very strong productivity, more than $2 billion in productivity for the year, and we have significantly increased our media support, and we see the results for those investments in the strong growth we continue to deliver in North America, including share growth consistently across every period. The strong results in Europe focus markets, including strong volume growth consistent across the quarters, so we feel good about those investments. We\u2019ll continue to be very disciplined and, as you can appreciate, not all of those investments will have paid out, so as we do our post-event analysis, we\u2019ll re-assess every step of the way, whether those are better flowing to the P&L or reinvested somewhere else. Productivity for fiscal \u201925 is also very strong, as I mentioned in my previous comments, so that will allow us to maintain fully invested both in terms of market support, as well as innovation, which is really the underpinning driver for our growth next year.\nJon Moeller: I would just add two or three comments. One, as Andre indicated, where you see the increase in marketing investment, that is largely in the geographies where we\u2019re seeing the growth accompany that from a top line standpoint. As he also said, we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of that spending and will adjust either up or down accordingly. Also, I just want to make sure we all understand the return on those investments is not an overnight occurrence. We have a commercialization cycle that needs to run its course, we have consumer purchase cycles that can be annual in some cases. While our portfolio is constructed to focus on categories where the product is used daily, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s purchased daily, and so it sometimes takes a little bit of time to evaluate and see the market response to those investments. But if you look at the last several years, it\u2019s generally always been there, and it\u2019s been one of the reasons for the growth over the last, call it six years as I mentioned in my remarks - plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, plus-4 in a more challenging environment. Like Andre, I feel good about the balance that\u2019s implied in the guidance and in our internal plans, but it\u2019s something we wake up every day and continue to re-evaluate and deliver in an optimal way.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Good morning guys, thank you. I was hoping that we could talk about fabric and home and baby and family specifically. It seems like those are the two segments that drove the most disconnect, at least versus external forecasts. The release cites promotional spending and at least a degree of share loss across those segments, so maybe you could just drill down further into the headline numbers, give us a bit more context of what you\u2019re seeing, both competitively and within your own momentum, and just how we should think about both the drivers and the timing of the build back in those businesses, noting you\u2019ve obviously got some challenging first half comparisons especially in the current quarter, but just really understanding where you expect those businesses to trend and land over the course of fiscal \u201925.\nAndre Schulten: Morning Steve. Look - home care, I think is just performing outstandingly well, 9% organic sales growth on the year, 13 quarters of sustained share growth and gaining momentum, so I think I\u2019d focus my comments on fabric care. I would tell you two things. Number one, we are annualizing record periods in Europe with differentiated pricing between competitors, where we had a bit of a tailwind last year that is turning into a high base comp. But structurally, the business is in great shape in Europe - Ariel continues to perform extremely well, the innovation across unit dose and the broader portfolio, including FE, is doing very well, so I expect that business to re-accelerate very quickly. In North America, we are just launching the innovation bundle, the spring innovation bundle which is supported with the right level of investment, including promotion investment and merchandising investment, and that\u2019s why you see the negative price mix component in the North American business. But the business is picking up momentum, we\u2019re growing share, so I expect also North America to continue to move in the right direction on fabric care, and we\u2019re very encouraged with the innovation, both the innovation that just launched and the innovation that is in the pipeline. Last point maybe on fabric care, in China specifically, we also made a portfolio choice to focus on the most profitable part of the business, and so there are some short term implications in terms of base period there. Again, for the longer term, benefit of the China fabric care business, I think that\u2019s the right decision, but it\u2019s part of the softness that you see right now in the current quarter. Baby care, I\u2019ll talk two regions. One is North America - the baby care business on the premium end continues to be doing very well. We have Swaddlers growing share by 1.4%, Cruisers 360 is growing, so on the premium end of the spectrum where we\u2019ve been able to innovate over the past one to two years, we continue to see the momentum accelerating across Pampers. We have an opportunity, we\u2019ve had an opportunity on Luvs, the mid-tier brand, where we postponed innovation due to some supply chain challenges. That innovation is now in the market, so again very significant acceleration expected given the innovation just launched in the market over the next few quarters. In Europe, again base period mostly in terms of share data, and that is something we need to work through, and certainly in Europe baby, I think that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019re watching our sufficiency of innovation very closely, simply because the spread versus private label is the most significant, so again the team is working through strong communication and innovation that will be launching here over the next few quarters.\nJon Moeller: I\u2019m just going to go in a slightly different direction here, Steve. I fully agree with Andre\u2019s description. There are also categories and sectors that are making really strong progress, that as we annualize the few challenges within them should manifest itself more clearly than it is now, so we\u2019ll have the benefit of those as we go through the year. What am I talking about? If you look at beauty as an example, the aggregate results are being heavily impacted by two things: SK-II and China, both of which should annualize by the second half of the year. If you then step back and look at the balance of the business, Head & Shoulders, in part behind the BARE innovation, increased sales by 7% last year. Pantene, in part behind the Pantene Miracles innovation, grew 10% last year. The personal care side of the business is growing extremely well as well. I just want to kind of complete the picture in terms of some of the progress that isn\u2019t as obvious in an aggregate look, but will make a difference going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could comment a bit, because one thing that\u2019s been absent is a discussion is the consumer broadly, so I think it could be helpful to get some perspective on the consumer environment. It feels like in U.S. and Western Europe, from what we\u2019ve heard from other companies, things in the last month or two have kind of gotten demonstrably worse, as a general statement, so curious your perspective on that, and then also differences in channel performance and what you\u2019re doing around that in terms of areas of particular focus or investment. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: From a consumer standpoint, we generally don\u2019t see the dynamic that some are describing, and I\u2019m not meaning to discredit their descriptions, but if you look at a couple of dynamics, private label shares as an example, which typically would be increasing during a time of significant consumer pressure, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing. Private label shares generally both in North America and Europe are in line with pre-COVID levels, and period to period, so last quarter to this quarter, are not changing significantly. The second data point that we look at to assess the answer to your question is back to volume, is unit growth declining, and that\u2019s again not what we\u2019re generally seeing. Now, certainly there are some consumers that are, I\u2019m sure, under increased pressure and are probably modifying their behavior and purchases correspondingly, but in our categories--and remember, of course, these are less discretionary categories, these are daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We typically have the best performing product in the market, at least that\u2019s our objective, and as a result, we\u2019re not seeing any significant consumer-driven impact. I\u2019ve been in Europe quite a bit recently, I\u2019ll be back there tomorrow, Andre was there earlier in the month of June with many of you at the Deutsch Bank conference, but also spent time with our business, and I\u2019m not seeing it there either. We remain encouraged as we go forward. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very cognizant of and watch very closely, but so far, so good.\nAndre Schulten: And the market growth rates, I think substantiate the point that Jon made. If you look at the U.S., I think the key point is over the past one, three, six, 12 months, the category volume growth in our categories is consistently 2%, so consumers are not decelerating consumption across our categories, and similarly if you look at value growth in Europe, it\u2019s also very consistent over the same period, so as Jon said, we\u2019re watching it, but we don\u2019t see it in the data.\nJon Moeller: And even--you know, if we look at the responsiveness to many of our strong innovations, I mentioned in my remarks Oral B IO, which is a significant premium to the balance both within the power segment and across power and manual, and it\u2019s growing at double digits. We built two share points in the last year, so just an example of responsiveness to strong innovation in these categories where performance drives brand choice.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. A couple of follow-ups. Could you just talk a little bit about the enterprise markets, what they would have looked like ex-Argentina, and then as you look at your guidance, how much of an actual rebound in China are you assuming, how much, if any, rebound in the Middle East issues are you assuming, and is that part of the range or is there no rebound at all in the range, if that\u2019s clear? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Robert. Enterprise markets, I think in aggregate are performing strongly for the year, up 6%, last year they were up, I think 10%, so I think very strong continued growth. Latin America, as we said, is growing on the year 15% and in the most recent quarter 8%. Europe focus markets up 8% for the year. Where we see headwinds is in the Middle East, in line with what we have described, so you see our Asia-Middle East-Africa markets impacted by those Middle East headwinds, and again we expect those to be temporary. The Argentina contribution to the total number is decreasing by almost a point quarter-over-quarter, so it was only 30 basis points in the current quarter. Most importantly, we divested the Argentina business, so that effect will not matter anymore in the current year because it will be removed from the organic sales base as we move through the quarter here. In terms of assumptions, I think that\u2019s part of the range, right? I would say we largely assume annualization. The upper end of the range would assume some level of improvement, but I think the main contribution to the midpoint of the range would be a normalization and annualization of those headwinds we were describing, including China, SK-II, the Middle East, and again Argentina coming out of the base because of the divestiture of the business.\nJon Moeller: And Robert, my view of those things as its reflected in guidance generally or indirectly is just as Andre described, which is annualization. I think if things improve either in the Middle East or China, we should have the opportunity to deliver, ceteris paribus, even better results than the midpoint of the guidance range. On the other hand, we\u2019re not assuming--I\u2019m not assuming that they get worse, and that can always happen, so I think we\u2019re centered on a realistic expectation of outcomes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira : Thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could talk about a bit of the pricing elasticity you\u2019re seeing in the category. I do understand what, Jon, you just described as being a very low penetration of private label and consumers are still driving the preference for your brands, but just curious about in laundry specifically, you had some promo, and some of the things that you had discussed are not necessarily driven by [indiscernible], but just wondering how you\u2019re seeing as we see more pricing coming through in this view. You\u2019re planning embedding in your base guidance, I understand it\u2019s a balanced approach to the organic sales growth for the midpoint at 4%, but wondering if there is any way of mitigating some of the effect in some of these other places which is natural, and therefore we can see some pricing go through inflation led and some pricing also led by innovation. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Andrea. Yes, I mean, pricing and mix have been a positive contribution to our results for 19 years. I don\u2019t expect this year to be different. I think it will be pricing for foreign exchange headwinds in some of the enterprise markets, which is in line with what the market generally executes. I also expect innovation base pricing and trade-up as we have a strong innovation pipeline in the year. From a promotion environment, we see stability at the moment. We have pockets of incremental promotion. We\u2019re still operating at about 85% versus pre-COVID levels, and we see general stability, so as I said in the guidance deconstruction on the top line, roughly we see the market half price mix driven, half volume driven. I don\u2019t expect our fiscal year numbers to be different than that, but they will look different obviously H1 versus H2 because of base period, but the general model is still the same as we executed over the last 19 years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the commodity outlook. Andre, you mentioned $300 million in headwind expected in fiscal \u201925. Can you maybe talk about the components of the headwind, some of the key commodities including pulp, resins, and also on the transportation side, given the recent rise in ocean freight, any potential impact there? Then in terms of--I know some of the commodities, you cannot hedge, but just the level of visibility given your contracted rates on that headwind, thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, hey Filippo. The commodity portfolio is actually at the moment relatively stable. Most of that headwind that is in the guidance is pulp at the moment. We continue to see strong demand on some of the grades and limited supply, so that\u2019s driving the run-up. The rest of the portfolio is actually stable. It won\u2019t be that throughout the year, as you know - I mean, these things change quickly, so there\u2019s a level of variability here, obviously, and we\u2019re forecasting a spot rate as we always do. The commodity effect as we think through visibility, look - I mean, the flow through is different by commodity class, but I think we discussed this when we were in the middle of the commodity crisis, it generally takes three months to nine months to flow through the P&L, so I think at the end of quarter one, we probably had relatively good visibility on most of it through H1, and then we\u2019ll go step by step. But again, this is one that we forecast on spot, we don\u2019t hedge, so the flow through again is the key driver of latency in terms of P&L, in terms of P&L effect. Transportation, look - generally energy, oil is relatively stable, so overall transportation is flat. Yes, we see some impact from increased transportation on the sea routes, but it is not material in the context of the year at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks Operator, good morning everyone. Hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to go back to Lauren\u2019s question on the consumer, and totally recognize that you may not be seeing some of the indicators that the consumer is under pressure today, but when we think about the 3% to 4% category growth assumptions you\u2019re embedding for your outlook, is there any cushion for the 85% of the markets that are currently performing well to potentially slow at all? I totally get the annualization commentary on the Middle East and China, but just would love to get some perspective on what you expect maybe in North America and Western Europe from here. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Peter. Yes, the 3% to 4% is a global number. Deconstructing that by market or by region is increasingly difficult, and we somewhat rely on the total aggregate of regions to play out in that 3% to 4% range. To your question on the 85% of the business slowing, what we see is actually what we had expected, right, that those regions slow down from a market growth in the range of 5% to 8% to this 3% to 4$ range, because the price mix component is coming down and the volume component is coming up, and that stabilization is built into our assumption for the year, so we expect most of those regions to play out the same way that we\u2019re projecting the global number, which is 3% to 4%, half of it volume, half of it price mix.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you, good morning. I had a question on your beauty segment. China has been a drag to your volumes for a while, as you mentioned, and we\u2019ve been hearing about the ongoing challenges in the region. But more recently, we\u2019re also hearing about the slowdown in the U.S. beauty market, so curious if that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019re seeing, and then how should we think about the growth potential for your beauty segment this fiscal year, and is it fair to assume that these challenges could drive a further slowdown from here? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Bonnie. If you look at the beauty results outside of China and SK-II, I think they give a better indication of the growth potential and trajectory we\u2019re on. The business ex-SK-II is growing 6% in quarter four, 7% in the fiscal year that we just closed. When you go through the segments and the core brands, if you look at Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, for example, grew high single digits to double digits. Those were the best results in the past five years. When you look at our personal care business, Old Spice, Secret and Native, double digit growth. We talked about--Jon talked about Native now being and reaching $700 million in sales, 10 times what we got the brand with, and our new brands, [indiscernible] are also growing double digits, so I think we see strength across the portfolio there. North America hair care is up 12%, global hair care is up 9%, and the personal care business, as I said, is doing very well. I think the core of the piece we are annualizing is really China, both on the Olay business and on the SK-II business, and as we said, our expectation is that we\u2019ll annualize. We don\u2019t yet assume a material acceleration in the fiscal year, so I\u2019ll leave it there. But again, I think the core of the business is strong, China is the one piece we need to see annualize across the first half.\nJon Moeller: And obviously we play in--the majority of the spaces that we play in, in beauty are more foundational versus prestige, and I think where some of the commentary in the marketplace has been directed relative to slowdown is really not in the base segments that we play in and, as Andre said, have continued to see very strong growth in. That\u2019s why I wanted to add to the question earlier, because I think it\u2019s somewhat lost in the aggregate numbers, but I think it\u2019s important both for recognition of the team but also recognition of the potential.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I know we\u2019re later in the call, so apologies for another China question, but maybe a bit more focus. It has been sluggish for a few years, which I think is why there\u2019s been so many questions about the effect of annualizing. You\u2019re not the only company to see slower results in China, so I wonder if you could just maybe comment on clearly there are macro dynamics in the market versus micro parts of your portfolio which specifically need some work. SK-II has been well covered by this point, so perhaps you can speak to some other businesses that are performing in line with your expectations or not, so that we can have a bit more of a portfolio view on why the annualization should deliver the outcomes you\u2019re expecting into the back half of the year. Sorry for another question on China, but it felt important. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Chris. I\u2019ll start and Jon will add. Let me start by saying, I think the China business coming from a double-digit growth trajectory through a significant dip, and we don\u2019t expect it to go back to double digits, we expect it over time to go to maybe mid singles, so more in line with what we see in other developed markets. For sure, we don\u2019t expect the return to the growth rates that we saw pre-COVID. Many of the effects specifically in China, SK-II, I think the run rate is now stable, so we\u2019re already seeing the run rate in terms of absolute volume and absolute dollar sale flattening. What\u2019s not yet there is the base period in line with those run rates, so unless we see a significant run rate reduction, that gives us confidence that the annualization would take place. Maybe other point of confidence here, the toughest category to compete in, in China right now is probably baby care. Birth rates are down 15% to 25% depending on how you define the market, and we\u2019ve been able--the team has been able to grow sales 6% and grow share in the market. Why? Because the portfolio and the innovation the team designed was very specific to the Chinese consumer - their needs, their preference in terms of superiority, and that\u2019s driving results. We\u2019ve been able to grow the Braun business with strong innovation, so there are pockets of business where we are leading the market, and we need to find our way to that across more categories, which we\u2019re working on. Fabric care, as I said, is very focused on the profitable part of the portfolio which allows them to drive innovation, which allows them to drive category growth, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s playing out across categories. But I think the most mechanical driver is run rates are stable and stabilizing, therefore unless we see a further decline in the market, which is entirely possible, but if those run rates hold, that will drive annualization towards the back half of the year.\nJon Moeller: Just to round that out, the largest business for P&G in China is hair care, and we spent the last year-plus as we came out of COVID ensuring that we had very strong hair care plans. I am very pleased with the plans that we\u2019ve put together and the execution of them on Pantene, the same on Head & Shoulders, really significantly improved propositions, significantly improved packaging, really looking strong. Andre mentioned somewhere in our discussion that we had made the choice to exit the third brand, which was Vidal Sassoon, so that should not be a source of drag going forward. We\u2019re still working, to be candid, on the plans for Rejoice, but the net of all of that is pretty encouraging.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. A question for both of you, perhaps, just on some context for investment levels, specifically trade spending in advertising and marketing, which are clearly moving higher. Gross margin and expansion there has naturally been supportive. I know it\u2019s not lost on you guys, you\u2019ve seen what your key competitor in oral care is doing, advertising and marketing there was the highest as a percent of sales in at least a couple decades, we\u2019ve seen trade spending move higher there in their North America segment. Advertising and marketing now for Procter has moved up 200 basis points this year, including a big step up of 300 basis points in the quarter, and we talked earlier on the call about [indiscernible] fabric care, so it\u2019s kind of a big [indiscernible]. If you could offer some context here for higher investment levels broadly we\u2019re seeing in the industry and then perhaps a push from a Procter perspective is are we satisfied with the top line payback that we\u2019re seeing, because spending levels are moving higher and the push would be towards sales, understanding some of the idiosyncratic items in the quarter, was a little bit soft and we\u2019re kind of guiding for growth similar to what we\u2019ve seen historically. Thank you for all that, but context and any color would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, let me start, Kevin - morning. Generally, what I\u2019d tell you is the--we\u2019re happy with the payout that we\u2019re seeing in the markets where we can read the payout cleanly, and that\u2019s really where 95% of the investment is, meaning Europe focus markets, some of the Europe enterprise markets, Latin America and North America, and I think the top line results support the overall payout of the aggregate of the media spend. We\u2019ll obviously go way lower in terms of penetration, and it is probably the strongest push that both Jon and I and Shailesh have as we engage with the businesses to ensure that that spending truly is productive, truly is driving market growth and sales growth, and therefore helps us to deliver top line and bottom line for the quarter and for the fiscal year. If that\u2019s no longer the case, then we will change gears and adjust. In terms of overall spend, I\u2019m actually pleased to see increase in media spend and market support that\u2019s market constructive. I think it helps the consumer understand the category better. It helps drive penetration, which is still a huge opportunity across multiple categories, so that\u2019s very positive. Again, the promotion environment in aggregate remains productive, and as long as those two results in what we see in North America, which is sustained volume growth on the category and sustained value growth on the category, I think we\u2019re in a good place.\nJon Moeller: And you know, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been pushing, we\u2019ve been pushing for some period of time. When you have a strategy that\u2019s centered on innovation and superiority and you have in some cases relatively low levels of advertising reach, that total equation doesn\u2019t make sense. We used to call it--David Taylor used to call it confidential superiority. We\u2019re trying to, in an effective way and in the most efficient way we can, and I mentioned this earlier, increase reach so that more consumers are aware of our products and the benefits that they provide them. Obviously that effort at some point reaches the right level of maturity, but we\u2019re still on the incline curve in that regard right now, which I think is entirely the right thing to do. As I mentioned earlier, it takes some time temporally for the business to respond. It does not respond overnight, again because of purchase cycles and commercialization cycles themselves, but as Andre said, take some assurance that you\u2019ve got a former CFO in the CEO\u2019s chair, between the two of us, we\u2019re not interested in wasting your money.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on promotions, if you could just talk about how much is competitors catching up on innovation, driving you to spend more to stay superior, versus a response to the tougher macros and needing to make yourself competitive on price. Then more importantly, you\u2019ve obviously done substantial innovation at the premium end. What are you doing as we think about this evolving macro in your mid tier products to remind consumers of the value proposition there? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Hey Olivia. I think our job is to lead market growth via irresistible superiority, and that starts with product, package and communication, but it includes value as you point out. I don\u2019t see that equation shifting. The competitive environment in terms of promotion is relatively stable. Our approach to promotion is relatively stable across the regions where we have the highest visibility, which is Europe and North America, so I don\u2019t view that equation as being different. Again, I think our stance on superiority, which we\u2019ve talked about now for almost a year, to reset the level of superiority we expect our businesses to deliver, which moves from your job is no longer to just win against the next best competitor in the market but is to create superiority at a level where consumers are drawn into the category, so we create new consumption, we create new consumers coming into the category, increasing their usage or trading up, that\u2019s really what we are measuring ourselves against, and I think we\u2019re making very good progress and I\u2019m very confident in the innovation pipeline we see for the current year. I\u2019m sure Jon has to add more. On the mid-tier, absolutely our job is to be irresistibly superior at every tier we compete in, and that\u2019s why the Luvs innovation is a great example, where--and it\u2019s a great example for the strategy at work, because if we are not superior in the mid-tier, the consumer tells us and it shows in the results. So the counter-action to innovate and drive superiority is what we do, and it\u2019s really independent of the tier, so at any given point in time, we need to make sure that we deliver all five vectors at every tier, every pack size, every price point in every channel we compete in.\nJon Moeller: If you just assume for a minute, Olivia, that we\u2019re wrong in the ongoing discussion that we\u2019ve had about consumers being under pressure, and our contention is that that really hasn\u2019t manifested itself as of yet, but just assume that we\u2019re wrong or that that changes going forward, and to your question on innovation, it becomes very important that we\u2019re innovating in categories that are going to become--that are going to see even higher levels of demand, if in fact there\u2019s any kind of consumer downturn. Andre mentioned Luvs. Another example--I mean, what happens if there\u2019s a consumer downturn, people eat at home more often, they\u2019re going out less frequently, traveling less frequently, and so categories like hand dishwashing, for example, become important, and our levels of innovation in that category, just as an example, are significant between power spray on Dawn and easy squeeze, and Andre mentioned the growth rates that we\u2019re seeing in our dish business. Typically, and this was certainly the case in COVID, which was an extreme condition, but people use more paper products if they\u2019re staying home more often, so things like the Charmin easy tear scallop perforation, which is driving significant levels of delight and 5% growth on the Charmin business last year, is another example of innovating, continuing to innovate in categories that are going to potentially be even more relevant in the event of a consumer downturn, and obviously just in general, that hand wash business is more of, if you will, a midtier business than the auto dish business, so there\u2019s no discrimination in terms of our commitment to innovation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about SK-II more broadly and just how do you see this part of today\u2019s portfolio for P&G. You know, I guess the slower improvement in China than anticipated, but just curious if you take a look over the last, call it four or five years, it does seem like the brand has grown in totality a little bit below what I\u2019d peg as the peer group, so I guess I\u2019m curious why you think that is, how you weave in improving trends in China with the overall expectations for the brand on a go-forward basis, and I say all that too in the context of weakness pre-dating the wastewater release in Japan, so what is there? Is there more competition, are you doing more from an innovation standpoint to broaden the appeal for the brand? Can you move it beyond prestige skin care? Just broader strokes, again in the context of how does it fit within the portfolio, thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, hey Mark. I think your question is specifically on China. I don\u2019t think our brand portfolio is something that I would be unhappy with. I think the brand portfolio is strong. When we get it right and when the consumer is willing to engage, I think we show strong progress on baby care even in adverse market conditions. Jon mentioned the progress we see on hair care, on Head & Shoulders and on Pantene. I think the parts of the portfolio where we had our doubts, we made the right choices, so we divested Vidal Sassoon and believe that was the right change in hair care. We have trimmed the fabric care portfolio to ensure that we can focus on the part of the market where we can create value for the consumer and for the company, so I feel good about the product portfolio. The challenge, I think in China, if I may, part of that is the channel shift. Because our footprint was disproportionately developed over 30 years to be a brick and mortar footprint and the digital acceleration obviously with COVID has shifted that into online to a large degree faster than anywhere else in the world, and within that online business, particularly to Douyin, heavily [indiscernible] led and heavily promotion led, and we\u2019re taking our time to transition our portfolio to ensure we end up with the right balance between serving consumers in brick and mortar and creating value there, and supporting our brands with the right messaging, equity, price stability and innovation in the online channels. That for me--that is the transition we\u2019re still in, but I think that transition is going well and it will show that that portfolio that we operate, I think can sustain mid single growth and value creation in China.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey everybody, good morning. I know as we get deep into the call, it gets quite granular, but if we could bring it back a little bit on something I think might have been missed as we chat global versus domestic, which is maybe just thinking about North America specifically and the first half specifically. What is the direction of travel that you\u2019re assuming for the consumer, and when we think about annualization of pricing and such, should we be modeling a drag for North America in the first half that then reverses, or is it meant to be closer to that balance for the full year of 50/50?\nAndre Schulten: Kaumil, it\u2019s very hard to predict, obviously, by quarter or H1 versus H2. I think you\u2019re in-going hunch is what I would share, as I think the price mix neutralization will continue through H1, and the volume component, I think is relatively stable. As I said, the market is continuing to grow at 2%, price mix has come down to about a point and a half, and I think that\u2019s what I would expect from a market growth perspective for the front half. Our objective is, as always, to be within that range, so that\u2019s my view; but again, that volatility can be driven by different innovation cycles, it can be driven by different promotion cycles, by channel shifts, so there is a lot of variability within that, but purely extrapolating from what we see in the market today, I think your hunch is right.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. I guess the only thing not covered on this call is the Olympics. I think I\u2019ve seen about 100 ads for Procter & Gamble products, some of them great, but I haven\u2019t noticed an increase in merchandising activity in our Nielsen tracking data in the U.S. around it. I was just wondering, do you view the Olympic sponsorship more as a brand building exercise for consumers, or have you been getting and do you expect to get a lot of merchandising activity around it in the U.S. that we\u2019ll be able to see in our tracking? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: We definitely view support of the Olympics as a brand building opportunity, as a consumer outreach opportunity, and frankly as a customer outreach opportunity. Where you\u2019ll see the activation in store is typically closer to the region of the event, so I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have large activation in North America. I\u2019m headed to Paris overnight tonight, I do expect to see significant activation in Europe. I\u2019ll be meeting with many of our retail partner CEOs at the Games, we host them there and spend up to a couple days together building plans going forward, which would include both during event and post event activation of the assets that we\u2019ve put in place for the Olympics. Just like our earlier discussion on return, this is something that we look at annually, but thus far it\u2019s proving to be an attractive vehicle when we focus the messaging on brands and not so much when we focus the messaging on company, simply because nobody buys P&G, they buy Tide and Ariel and Pampers, Pantene and Head & Shoulders, etc. So all good, and I\u2019m looking forward to being there with our customers and our European team over the balance of the week.\nJon Moeller: Before we let--not let, before we officially end the call, I just wanted to provide again some longer term perspectives, and I\u2019m free to--I\u2019m happy to discuss it at any point during the balance of the day. We have been through--the collective we, including you, have been through incredible challenges the last number of years, whether that\u2019s COVID, whether that\u2019s inflation, whether that\u2019s war, political divisiveness, regulation - you name it. One of the things that I think is important to reflect on, the quarter\u2019s important and we reflected a lot on that today, which is appropriate, but it\u2019s also important to step back and say, how is this strategy working, not just for the quarter but for longer periods of time, as I mentioned in my remarks, pre-COVID, during COVID, post COVID, inflation, pricing, and then the big geopolitical struggles that we\u2019re all engaged in currently. Over that six-year period, the team has added $17 billion in sales, which puts us at the 88th percentile of the S&P 500, and at the same time they\u2019ve added $5 billion in profit, which puts us at the 93rd percentile of the S&P 500. They\u2019ve built more than 200--I haven\u2019t looked today, but before today, $200 billion in market cap in that six-year period, which is more value than most of our competitors, I think all but one, have created over their entire history as a company, so this is something that is working extraordinarily well. I think that\u2019s important to reflect on as we move forward. We\u2019re in a stronger place in terms of executing against that strategy than we\u2019ve ever been. We\u2019ve talked about investment in innovation, we\u2019ve talked about raising the bar on superiority, we\u2019ve talked about the progress that we\u2019re making on productivity. We\u2019ve talked about the support levels that our business has, we\u2019ve talked about resuming volume growth in most of the major markets and doing that while building margin and simultaneously increasing our investment in these kinds of things, and I don\u2019t see any reason in a--if we do find ourselves in a more difficult environment from a consumer economic standpoint, one of the things we talk about internally is would we change our approach if we either had confidence that things were going to get remarkably better from a consumer standpoint or remarkably worse from a consumer standpoint, would we not want to be in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice? I think that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019d want to be in either of those scenarios. Would we not want to be able to delight consumers and customers with superior products? I can\u2019t imagine how that would be a good idea. Would we not want to have the productivity that enables us to fund those investments and accelerate innovation? Would we not want to have a more agile accountable organization structure? All these things to me, under any scenario, both because of the results that they deliver and because of the potential they hold to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners, are the right path forward, which is why we talk about continuing to double down. I have said many times, this will not be a straight line. There are all sorts of things that affect the trend line in the business, but over periods of time, this is by far--if we just look at our history as a company, it has produced significantly positive results, and I expect that to continue. I just wanted to share that as we close out the call. Again, that is not trying to minimize some of the challenges that we\u2019ve been discussing on the quarter and on the first half of next year. Those are real, they\u2019re important to talk about, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re controlling as we think about the mid and longer term. Have a great day, and look forward to catching up with you soon.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Thanks Andre. I'll start with a few thoughts on results before discussing the strategy. Our team continues to execute the strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past six years pre-COVID, during COVID, through a historic inflationary and a pricing cycle, and through geopolitical tensions. Organic sales growth of plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, and plus-4 over the last fiscal years. Strong earnings growth and growth in operating margin expansion. Very strong cash generation and over $96 billion of cash returned to share owners over those six years. For fiscal '24, going-in organic sales guidance was 4% to 5%. We delivered 4% in a very volatile environment. Flat volume for the year with improving trajectory through the year, 2% growth in the fourth quarter. Strong volume growth in North America and Europe focus markets offsetting soft markets in enterprise regions in China. Going-in core EPS guidance of 6% to 9%, delivered 12%. Core gross margin at a 17-year high with strong productivity improvement funding strong marketing investments. Going-in cash productivity outlook of 90%, delivered 105% which enabled a 7% dividend increase, the 68th consecutive year of increase and the 134th consecutive year paying a dividend. As Andre said, strong results in a challenging environment. To be very clear, there's still more work to do to continue improving areas in our control, which will be needed to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control. We'll double down on superiority across all five vectors. We'll double down on productivity up and down the P&L and across the balance sheet. We'll double down on enabling our organization to execute our integrated strategy with excellence, to delight consumers and win in the marketplace, to deliver the level of balanced growth and value creation results you and we expect. Our strategy is dynamic and sustainable. It adapts to the changing needs of consumers, customers and society and is focused on growing markets, creating versus taking business, the most sustainable and typically most profitable way to grow. A focused portfolio of daily use products and categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies. As you know, we are active managers of our portfolio. Over the last several years, we have made some targeted additions and subtractions in that portfolio. We have adjusted our operating model in several markets. Each of these moves were made with a focus on long term balanced growth and value creation. The second strategy element, ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to delight consumers, grow markets and our share in them, to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights, communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands and priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. We've talked many times about the superiority driven market growth, share growth, and sales growth we've achieved with products like Tide and Ariel pods, Downy and Lenor laundry scent beads, and Dawn and Fairy easy squeeze and power wash. Two more examples: Oral B IO power toothbrushes deliver superior cleaning and delightful user experience. Superior communication includes the insight that manual brushes leave 50% of plaque behind, but Oral B IO delivers 100% more plaque bacterial removal with its round head and removes plaque in hard to reach places. This superior proposition is accelerating power brush trial and adoption, bringing new power brush users into the category, driving high single digit market growth of the power brush category, double digit sales growth for Oral B power, and two points of Oral B value share growth over the past 12 months. Native, our premium personal care brand is delivering superiority across all five vectors and across multiple product forms, including deodorants, body wash, shampoo and conditioners, superior performance with fewer ingredients and irresistible scents. Transparent labeling and clean white packaging, superior retail execution and strong retailer partnerships showcasing the full range of forms and scents. Premium positioning with the category providing superior value for the consumer looking for an offering with more natural ingredients. Native has driven a step change in market value growth for the U.S. deodorants and personal care categories from low singles to mid teens. Native sales have grown nearly 10 times over the last five years to over $700 million in fiscal '24. Third strategy element, productivity improvement in all areas of our operations. In order to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth to mitigate cost and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash. We delivered very strong cost savings in fiscal '24. Visibility to more savings opportunities is increasing as the businesses continue to build their three-year rolling productivity master plans. We have an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chains 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain end to end versus simply trying to optimize our respective pieces. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using digital tools to optimize fill rates and for our dynamic routing and sourcing optimization. $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity. More efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continued to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization, an inclusive and diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. Strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas that we've outlined previously. Number one, supply chain 3.0, it's delivering productivity, as you can see in the results. We're also driving improved agility, flexibility, scalability and transparency in a rapidly evolving landscape. Optimized sustainable and flexible up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strength what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners in third party industry surveys. Next, environmental sustainability. Superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are more sustainable. Driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. The next focus area is digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers , streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving share owner value. One example is the improvement we've delivered in ad copy qualification and media buying with proprietary digital tools we've developed and the digital molecule development work in fabric care. We've built similar tools to drive faster, cheaper and better innovation in perfume, which benefits almost every product category in the company. We're also digitizing more of our back office work processes to lower costs and drive efficiencies while delivering higher quality output. Each of these examples has obvious cost benefits, but they're also driving product and package superiority, superior brand communication to consumers, superior retail execution in store and online, stronger internal controls and jobs that enable people to focus on higher order tasks with greater business impact. Last focus area, a superior value equation for all employees, for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not separate strategies, they simply strengthen our ability to execute our integrated growth strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption of our organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe there's merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth in value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. I believe in the capabilities and commitment of P&G people to serve consumers and to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G's values and principles. I'm excited about what lays ahead. Of course we'll continue to face challenges, but the future holds great promise. We have many opportunities ahead to grow markets, grow our business, and create significant value for our owners. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year. We're very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered over the last year and inclusive of prior years in a very challenging and volatile environment. The earnings power and value creation potential of the company are as strong as ever. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. I agree with everything that Andre just said. I would remind you relative to the comment of performing versus our own expectations, precisely because of the volatility of the world that we all live and operate in, we don't provide quarterly guidance, we only provide annual guidance, and as Andre said, we met our beat, each of those numbers that were provided. There have been two primary questions that have been--that we've all been working through. One is can we re-accelerate volume, and as Andre said, that is broadly happening and impressively so. If you look at North America over the course of the fiscal year, plus-3, plus-3, plus-4, plus-3. If we look at Europe, plus-2, plus-3, plus-4, plus-2. Andre gave you figures for some of the other regions, but broadly that question f can volume be re-accelerated is answered with an emphatic yes. The second question that at least we've been working through is, can that happen in the context of continued margin expansion? If you look at the fiscal year numbers, top line to bottom line that's definitely happened. If you look at gross margin in the quarter we just completed, which comes in at a 17-year high, we're certainly able to continue to re-accelerate volume growth while holding or building margins. Like Andre, I approach next year in a realistic fashion and realizing that the first couple quarters are going to look a little bit more like the one we just completed, but with overall a belief that the fundamentals of the business are in very strong shape and that as we bring the innovation that's planned to market throughout the fiscal year, we're going to be happy with the results in line with the guidance that he's provided. One other element of the strength and health of the business fundamentally, if you look at the last fiscal year at a brand level, 21 out of 25 brands were growing. Eleven of those 25 brands were growing at high single digits or higher rates, so again from a breadth standpoint, I think we're positioned very well and the team's doing a great job. Thanks Dara. I'm going to turn it over to Andre to take us through some of the details, and then I'll round out the answer. Go ahead, Andre. I would just add two or three comments. One, as Andre indicated, where you see the increase in marketing investment, that is largely in the geographies where we're seeing the growth accompany that from a top line standpoint. As he also said, we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of that spending and will adjust either up or down accordingly. Also, I just want to make sure we all understand the return on those investments is not an overnight occurrence. We have a commercialization cycle that needs to run its course, we have consumer purchase cycles that can be annual in some cases. While our portfolio is constructed to focus on categories where the product is used daily, that doesn't mean it's purchased daily, and so it sometimes takes a little bit of time to evaluate and see the market response to those investments. But if you look at the last several years, it's generally always been there, and it's been one of the reasons for the growth over the last, call it six years as I mentioned in my remarks - plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, plus-4 in a more challenging environment. Like Andre, I feel good about the balance that's implied in the guidance and in our internal plans, but it's something we wake up every day and continue to re-evaluate and deliver in an optimal way. I'm just going to go in a slightly different direction here, Steve. I fully agree with Andre's description. There are also categories and sectors that are making really strong progress, that as we annualize the few challenges within them should manifest itself more clearly than it is now, so we'll have the benefit of those as we go through the year. What am I talking about? If you look at beauty as an example, the aggregate results are being heavily impacted by two things: SK-II and China, both of which should annualize by the second half of the year. If you then step back and look at the balance of the business, Head & Shoulders, in part behind the BARE innovation, increased sales by 7% last year. Pantene, in part behind the Pantene Miracles innovation, grew 10% last year. The personal care side of the business is growing extremely well as well. I just want to kind of complete the picture in terms of some of the progress that isn't as obvious in an aggregate look, but will make a difference going forward. From a consumer standpoint, we generally don't see the dynamic that some are describing, and I'm not meaning to discredit their descriptions, but if you look at a couple of dynamics, private label shares as an example, which typically would be increasing during a time of significant consumer pressure, that's not what we're seeing. Private label shares generally both in North America and Europe are in line with pre-COVID levels, and period to period, so last quarter to this quarter, are not changing significantly. The second data point that we look at to assess the answer to your question is back to volume, is unit growth declining, and that's again not what we're generally seeing. Now, certainly there are some consumers that are, I'm sure, under increased pressure and are probably modifying their behavior and purchases correspondingly, but in our categories--and remember, of course, these are less discretionary categories, these are daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We typically have the best performing product in the market, at least that's our objective, and as a result, we're not seeing any significant consumer-driven impact. I've been in Europe quite a bit recently, I'll be back there tomorrow, Andre was there earlier in the month of June with many of you at the Deutsch Bank conference, but also spent time with our business, and I'm not seeing it there either. We remain encouraged as we go forward. It's something that we're very cognizant of and watch very closely, but so far, so good. And even--you know, if we look at the responsiveness to many of our strong innovations, I mentioned in my remarks Oral B IO, which is a significant premium to the balance both within the power segment and across power and manual, and it's growing at double digits. We built two share points in the last year, so just an example of responsiveness to strong innovation in these categories where performance drives brand choice. And Robert, my view of those things as its reflected in guidance generally or indirectly is just as Andre described, which is annualization. I think if things improve either in the Middle East or China, we should have the opportunity to deliver, ceteris paribus, even better results than the midpoint of the guidance range. On the other hand, we're not assuming--I'm not assuming that they get worse, and that can always happen, so I think we're centered on a realistic expectation of outcomes. And obviously we play in--the majority of the spaces that we play in, in beauty are more foundational versus prestige, and I think where some of the commentary in the marketplace has been directed relative to slowdown is really not in the base segments that we play in and, as Andre said, have continued to see very strong growth in. That's why I wanted to add to the question earlier, because I think it's somewhat lost in the aggregate numbers, but I think it's important both for recognition of the team but also recognition of the potential. Just to round that out, the largest business for P&G in China is hair care, and we spent the last year-plus as we came out of COVID ensuring that we had very strong hair care plans. I am very pleased with the plans that we've put together and the execution of them on Pantene, the same on Head & Shoulders, really significantly improved propositions, significantly improved packaging, really looking strong. Andre mentioned somewhere in our discussion that we had made the choice to exit the third brand, which was Vidal Sassoon, so that should not be a source of drag going forward. We're still working, to be candid, on the plans for Rejoice, but the net of all of that is pretty encouraging. And you know, it's something I've been pushing, we've been pushing for some period of time. When you have a strategy that's centered on innovation and superiority and you have in some cases relatively low levels of advertising reach, that total equation doesn't make sense. We used to call it--David Taylor used to call it confidential superiority. We're trying to, in an effective way and in the most efficient way we can, and I mentioned this earlier, increase reach so that more consumers are aware of our products and the benefits that they provide them. Obviously that effort at some point reaches the right level of maturity, but we're still on the incline curve in that regard right now, which I think is entirely the right thing to do. As I mentioned earlier, it takes some time temporally for the business to respond. It does not respond overnight, again because of purchase cycles and commercialization cycles themselves, but as Andre said, take some assurance that you've got a former CFO in the CEO's chair, between the two of us, we're not interested in wasting your money. If you just assume for a minute, Olivia, that we're wrong in the ongoing discussion that we've had about consumers being under pressure, and our contention is that that really hasn't manifested itself as of yet, but just assume that we're wrong or that that changes going forward, and to your question on innovation, it becomes very important that we're innovating in categories that are going to become--that are going to see even higher levels of demand, if in fact there's any kind of consumer downturn. Andre mentioned Luvs. Another example--I mean, what happens if there's a consumer downturn, people eat at home more often, they're going out less frequently, traveling less frequently, and so categories like hand dishwashing, for example, become important, and our levels of innovation in that category, just as an example, are significant between power spray on Dawn and easy squeeze, and Andre mentioned the growth rates that we're seeing in our dish business. Typically, and this was certainly the case in COVID, which was an extreme condition, but people use more paper products if they're staying home more often, so things like the Charmin easy tear scallop perforation, which is driving significant levels of delight and 5% growth on the Charmin business last year, is another example of innovating, continuing to innovate in categories that are going to potentially be even more relevant in the event of a consumer downturn, and obviously just in general, that hand wash business is more of, if you will, a midtier business than the auto dish business, so there's no discrimination in terms of our commitment to innovation. We definitely view support of the Olympics as a brand building opportunity, as a consumer outreach opportunity, and frankly as a customer outreach opportunity. Where you'll see the activation in store is typically closer to the region of the event, so I wouldn't expect it to have large activation in North America. I'm headed to Paris overnight tonight, I do expect to see significant activation in Europe. I'll be meeting with many of our retail partner CEOs at the Games, we host them there and spend up to a couple days together building plans going forward, which would include both during event and post event activation of the assets that we've put in place for the Olympics. Just like our earlier discussion on return, this is something that we look at annually, but thus far it's proving to be an attractive vehicle when we focus the messaging on brands and not so much when we focus the messaging on company, simply because nobody buys P&G, they buy Tide and Ariel and Pampers, Pantene and Head & Shoulders, etc. So all good, and I'm looking forward to being there with our customers and our European team over the balance of the week. Before we let--not let, before we officially end the call, I just wanted to provide again some longer term perspectives, and I'm free to--I'm happy to discuss it at any point during the balance of the day. We have been through--the collective we, including you, have been through incredible challenges the last number of years, whether that's COVID, whether that's inflation, whether that's war, political divisiveness, regulation - you name it. One of the things that I think is important to reflect on, the quarter's important and we reflected a lot on that today, which is appropriate, but it's also important to step back and say, how is this strategy working, not just for the quarter but for longer periods of time, as I mentioned in my remarks, pre-COVID, during COVID, post COVID, inflation, pricing, and then the big geopolitical struggles that we're all engaged in currently. Over that six-year period, the team has added $17 billion in sales, which puts us at the 88th percentile of the S&P 500, and at the same time they've added $5 billion in profit, which puts us at the 93rd percentile of the S&P 500. They've built more than 200--I haven't looked today, but before today, $200 billion in market cap in that six-year period, which is more value than most of our competitors, I think all but one, have created over their entire history as a company, so this is something that is working extraordinarily well. I think that's important to reflect on as we move forward. We're in a stronger place in terms of executing against that strategy than we've ever been. We've talked about investment in innovation, we've talked about raising the bar on superiority, we've talked about the progress that we're making on productivity. We've talked about the support levels that our business has, we've talked about resuming volume growth in most of the major markets and doing that while building margin and simultaneously increasing our investment in these kinds of things, and I don't see any reason in a--if we do find ourselves in a more difficult environment from a consumer economic standpoint, one of the things we talk about internally is would we change our approach if we either had confidence that things were going to get remarkably better from a consumer standpoint or remarkably worse from a consumer standpoint, would we not want to be in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice? I think that's exactly where we'd want to be in either of those scenarios. Would we not want to be able to delight consumers and customers with superior products? I can't imagine how that would be a good idea. Would we not want to have the productivity that enables us to fund those investments and accelerate innovation? Would we not want to have a more agile accountable organization structure? All these things to me, under any scenario, both because of the results that they deliver and because of the potential they hold to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners, are the right path forward, which is why we talk about continuing to double down. I have said many times, this will not be a straight line. There are all sorts of things that affect the trend line in the business, but over periods of time, this is by far--if we just look at our history as a company, it has produced significantly positive results, and I expect that to continue. I just wanted to share that as we close out the call. Again, that is not trying to minimize some of the challenges that we've been discussing on the quarter and on the first half of next year. Those are real, they're important to talk about, but I don't think they're controlling as we think about the mid and longer term. Have a great day, and look forward to catching up with you soon."

            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of results for fiscal year '24 and for the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal '25 and then take your questions. Fiscal '24 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies enabled the company to meet or exceed going-in guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners, all this despite significant market level headwinds that were largely unknown when we gave our initial outlook for the year. Organic sales growth for the fiscal year was 4%, our sixth consecutive year of 4% or better organic growth against a strong 7% comp in the prior year and in more challenging market conditions. Growth was broad-based across business units with eight of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care, hair care and grooming were up high single digits, oral care and feminine care up mid singles. Fabric care, family care, and personal healthcare grew low single digits. Skin and personal care and baby care were down low singles. Focus markets grew 4% for the year with North America up 5% and Europe focus markets up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down 9% versus the prior year, driven by soft market conditions and brand-specific headwinds on SK-II. Enterprise markets were up 6%, led by Latin America with 15% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 9%, now representing 18% of the total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth continues to drive share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew around 5% in fiscal '24. P&G consumption grew ahead of our fair share of category growth, driving modest value and volume share growth for the year. We grew global aggregate value share. Thirty of 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Six of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $6.59, up 12% for the year. Core gross margin improved 360 basis points and core operating margin increased 170 basis points. Over $2.3 billion of productivity improvements were enabled by a significant increase in investment in superior products, packages and brand communication to drive market growth. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 16% and core operating margin increased 250 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%. We increased our dividend by 7% and returned over $14 billion of value to share owners, $9.3 billion in dividends, and $5 billion in share repurchase. Moving onto fourth quarter results, organic sales rounded down to 2%, volume was up 2%, solid sequential progress. Pricing was up 1% and mix was in line with prior year. Growth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions. Nine of 10 product categories grew or held organic sales in the quarter. Home care, hair care, grooming and oral care were each up high single digits, feminine care up low singles, skin and personal care, fabric care, personal health care and family care were each in line with prior year, and baby care was down mid singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 2% and enterprise markets up 2% for the quarter. Organic sales in North America grew 4% with four points of volume growth and price mix, in line with prior year. European focus markets organic sales were up 2% against a strong 12% comp in the base period. Volume was up 3%. Price mix was down a point as the region has now fully annualized prior year inflation-driven pricing. Latin America organic sales were up 8%, including high singles growth in Brazil. Of note, Argentina's overall contribution to organic sales for the region and the company were lower than the last two quarters due to the divestiture of a portion of the business in March and a notable decline in shipment volume for the remaining categories. As was announced earlier this month, we have divested the remaining portions of our operations in Argentina. As a result, Argentina will be largely removed from our organic sales reporting in fiscal year '25. Select P&G brands will still be available in the market through a distribution and licensing agreement with the new owner of the operations. Greater China organic sales declined 8%. Underlying market conditions have remained weak and the 6/18 key consumption period was down sharply versus prior year, just as we saw in the 11/11 Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day shopping periods. Also, brand-specific headwinds have continued on SK-II due to its Japanese heritage. We expect general market trends and the dynamics related to SK-II to improve over time, though it will likely be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia have remained soft. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Global aggregate market share was down 30 basis points as we are now annualizing very strong growth in European-focused markets. Twenty-five of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.40, up 2% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 6%. Core gross margin increased 140 basis points and core operating margin decreased 100 basis points. Strong productivity improvements of 250 basis points, funding a meaningful increase in marketing investment, currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 148%. We returned nearly $4 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, over $2.4 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year: organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash productivity and cash returns to share owners, strong performance again this year in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. With that, I'll pass it over to Jon. Thank you Jon. As we enter fiscal '25, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from input costs, currencies, to consumers, competitors, retailers, and geopolitical dynamics. As Jon said, we'll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers every step of the way. Our going-in guidance for fiscal '25 is consistent with our long term algorithm. On the top line, we currently expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. Our objective is to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth in these markets. This translates to an organic sales growth guidance range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal year - apologies, I had my mic muted. On the bottom line, our algorithm calls for mid to high single digit core earnings per share growth. Our core EPS guidance range for fiscal '25 starts the year at 5% to 7% versus fiscal '24 core EPS of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, $6.98 up 6% at the center of the range. This outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $300 million after tax and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $200 million after tax. Combined, foreign exchange and commodities are projected to be a headwind of $0.20 per share for fiscal '25, or a 3 percentage point drag on core EPS growth. In addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from several minor brand divestitures, and we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $7 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. While we are clear eyed on the challenges in the market and the work needed to continue to drive the business, fiscal '25 guidance for top line, bottom line and cash are each consistent with our long term algorithm. A few items for you to consider as you build your quarter-to-quarter estimates. On the top line, please keep in mind that the July to September period has the most difficult comp for the year, and many of the market-level challenges we've noted will not fully annualize or improve materially in our estimate until the second half of the year. On the bottom line, the foreign exchange and commodity headwinds skew a bit toward the front half of the year, and the back half comps include the benefit of the tax items and minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. With that, I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Morning Bryan. I'll start and then Jon, I'm sure, will add some perspective as well. I'll start back where we kind of started the prepared remarks. I think we delivered a year where we exceeded on that, all of our in-going guidance metrics. Now, the year wasn't linear, as you highlight, and I'd distinguish two parts of the business. Eighty-five percent of the business is performing right in line with expectations, and right in line with what we would have expected throughout the year. We have strong growth in North America, 4% in the quarter, 4% volume growth in the quarter. Europe focus markets growing volumes at 3%, Europe enterprise markets growing volumes at 6%, LA normalizing to about 8% organic sales growth, so that's part of the business where the trajectory is not impacted by significant external events. I think it's moving right along. We expected the normalization and price-mix contribution, as we have talked throughout the quarters. If you look at the headwinds that we started to communicate in December, they are really still with us in--throughout the second half, and that's what's driving the volatility in the top line results. Those headwinds have accelerated in part, and honestly in quarter four, some of them developed late in the quarter, so when you think about China and SK-II, we're heavily impacted by 6/18, a weaker key consumption period in China, and overall market sentiment in China has not improved throughout H2. We had highlighted that we expect the China recovery to be slow and to take time, and I think that's playing out in the results we see in the second half. The Middle East situation has not really improved, so we continue to see developing stronger impacts on western retailers in some of these markets, and while the team has implemented many interventions, the execution in-store has been limited by some of these headwinds in the Middle East. The last element, we saw a softening in quarter four on the Argentina volumes driven by the general circumstances in the market, strong high translation pricing in Argentina, so there was a softer contribution on organic sales growth in quarter four than what we'd seen in quarter three. If you step back, though, the performance of the business and the way we set up for '25, I think is very strong. Eighty five of the business is developing right in line with what we would have expected. We're growing share in North America. The balance of the markets are growing volume, which is really the shift we needed to see. Our gross margin is at record levels. Our productivity is very strong. That has enabled us to remain fully invested from a media perspective and from an innovation perspective, and so going into the year, we feel all the structural elements of the business are strong. Now, what is important to understand, and we mentioned it in the prepared remarks, those headwinds that we have experienced in H2 will still be with us in H1 of this fiscal year, so we expect this year not to be linear and we have to accelerate sales growth throughout the quarters as some of these headwinds annualize and we return to growth. But overall, I think we're well set up to deliver against the guidance metrics we just communicated. Yes, thanks for the question, Dara. The volume versus price mix contribution is expected to be broadly balanced. We expected markets to return to more sustainable growth rates of 3% to 4% - that is largely happening now, and if you look at the construction of that market growth, about half of that is driven by volume, the other half is driven by price mix. I would expect our construct to look similar for the fiscal year. Obviously it will differ by quarter and front half versus back half, but broadly balanced between volume and price mix. On the margin perspective, you saw us make a choice to continue to invest fully in the business. We have delivered very strong productivity, more than $2 billion in productivity for the year, and we have significantly increased our media support, and we see the results for those investments in the strong growth we continue to deliver in North America, including share growth consistently across every period. The strong results in Europe focus markets, including strong volume growth consistent across the quarters, so we feel good about those investments. We'll continue to be very disciplined and, as you can appreciate, not all of those investments will have paid out, so as we do our post-event analysis, we'll re-assess every step of the way, whether those are better flowing to the P&L or reinvested somewhere else. Productivity for fiscal '25 is also very strong, as I mentioned in my previous comments, so that will allow us to maintain fully invested both in terms of market support, as well as innovation, which is really the underpinning driver for our growth next year. Morning Steve. Look - home care, I think is just performing outstandingly well, 9% organic sales growth on the year, 13 quarters of sustained share growth and gaining momentum, so I think I'd focus my comments on fabric care. I would tell you two things. Number one, we are annualizing record periods in Europe with differentiated pricing between competitors, where we had a bit of a tailwind last year that is turning into a high base comp. But structurally, the business is in great shape in Europe - Ariel continues to perform extremely well, the innovation across unit dose and the broader portfolio, including FE, is doing very well, so I expect that business to re-accelerate very quickly. In North America, we are just launching the innovation bundle, the spring innovation bundle which is supported with the right level of investment, including promotion investment and merchandising investment, and that's why you see the negative price mix component in the North American business. But the business is picking up momentum, we're growing share, so I expect also North America to continue to move in the right direction on fabric care, and we're very encouraged with the innovation, both the innovation that just launched and the innovation that is in the pipeline. Last point maybe on fabric care, in China specifically, we also made a portfolio choice to focus on the most profitable part of the business, and so there are some short term implications in terms of base period there. Again, for the longer term, benefit of the China fabric care business, I think that's the right decision, but it's part of the softness that you see right now in the current quarter. Baby care, I'll talk two regions. One is North America - the baby care business on the premium end continues to be doing very well. We have Swaddlers growing share by 1.4%, Cruisers 360 is growing, so on the premium end of the spectrum where we've been able to innovate over the past one to two years, we continue to see the momentum accelerating across Pampers. We have an opportunity, we've had an opportunity on Luvs, the mid-tier brand, where we postponed innovation due to some supply chain challenges. That innovation is now in the market, so again very significant acceleration expected given the innovation just launched in the market over the next few quarters. In Europe, again base period mostly in terms of share data, and that is something we need to work through, and certainly in Europe baby, I think that's one of the areas where we're watching our sufficiency of innovation very closely, simply because the spread versus private label is the most significant, so again the team is working through strong communication and innovation that will be launching here over the next few quarters. And the market growth rates, I think substantiate the point that Jon made. If you look at the U.S., I think the key point is over the past one, three, six, 12 months, the category volume growth in our categories is consistently 2%, so consumers are not decelerating consumption across our categories, and similarly if you look at value growth in Europe, it's also very consistent over the same period, so as Jon said, we're watching it, but we don't see it in the data. Hey Robert. Enterprise markets, I think in aggregate are performing strongly for the year, up 6%, last year they were up, I think 10%, so I think very strong continued growth. Latin America, as we said, is growing on the year 15% and in the most recent quarter 8%. Europe focus markets up 8% for the year. Where we see headwinds is in the Middle East, in line with what we have described, so you see our Asia-Middle East-Africa markets impacted by those Middle East headwinds, and again we expect those to be temporary. The Argentina contribution to the total number is decreasing by almost a point quarter-over-quarter, so it was only 30 basis points in the current quarter. Most importantly, we divested the Argentina business, so that effect will not matter anymore in the current year because it will be removed from the organic sales base as we move through the quarter here. In terms of assumptions, I think that's part of the range, right? I would say we largely assume annualization. The upper end of the range would assume some level of improvement, but I think the main contribution to the midpoint of the range would be a normalization and annualization of those headwinds we were describing, including China, SK-II, the Middle East, and again Argentina coming out of the base because of the divestiture of the business. Hey Andrea. Yes, I mean, pricing and mix have been a positive contribution to our results for 19 years. I don't expect this year to be different. I think it will be pricing for foreign exchange headwinds in some of the enterprise markets, which is in line with what the market generally executes. I also expect innovation base pricing and trade-up as we have a strong innovation pipeline in the year. From a promotion environment, we see stability at the moment. We have pockets of incremental promotion. We're still operating at about 85% versus pre-COVID levels, and we see general stability, so as I said in the guidance deconstruction on the top line, roughly we see the market half price mix driven, half volume driven. I don't expect our fiscal year numbers to be different than that, but they will look different obviously H1 versus H2 because of base period, but the general model is still the same as we executed over the last 19 years. Yes, hey Filippo. The commodity portfolio is actually at the moment relatively stable. Most of that headwind that is in the guidance is pulp at the moment. We continue to see strong demand on some of the grades and limited supply, so that's driving the run-up. The rest of the portfolio is actually stable. It won't be that throughout the year, as you know - I mean, these things change quickly, so there's a level of variability here, obviously, and we're forecasting a spot rate as we always do. The commodity effect as we think through visibility, look - I mean, the flow through is different by commodity class, but I think we discussed this when we were in the middle of the commodity crisis, it generally takes three months to nine months to flow through the P&L, so I think at the end of quarter one, we probably had relatively good visibility on most of it through H1, and then we'll go step by step. But again, this is one that we forecast on spot, we don't hedge, so the flow through again is the key driver of latency in terms of P&L, in terms of P&L effect. Transportation, look - generally energy, oil is relatively stable, so overall transportation is flat. Yes, we see some impact from increased transportation on the sea routes, but it is not material in the context of the year at this point. Hey Peter. Yes, the 3% to 4% is a global number. Deconstructing that by market or by region is increasingly difficult, and we somewhat rely on the total aggregate of regions to play out in that 3% to 4% range. To your question on the 85% of the business slowing, what we see is actually what we had expected, right, that those regions slow down from a market growth in the range of 5% to 8% to this 3% to 4$ range, because the price mix component is coming down and the volume component is coming up, and that stabilization is built into our assumption for the year, so we expect most of those regions to play out the same way that we're projecting the global number, which is 3% to 4%, half of it volume, half of it price mix. Hey Bonnie. If you look at the beauty results outside of China and SK-II, I think they give a better indication of the growth potential and trajectory we're on. The business ex-SK-II is growing 6% in quarter four, 7% in the fiscal year that we just closed. When you go through the segments and the core brands, if you look at Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, for example, grew high single digits to double digits. Those were the best results in the past five years. When you look at our personal care business, Old Spice, Secret and Native, double digit growth. We talked about--Jon talked about Native now being and reaching $700 million in sales, 10 times what we got the brand with, and our new brands, [indiscernible] are also growing double digits, so I think we see strength across the portfolio there. North America hair care is up 12%, global hair care is up 9%, and the personal care business, as I said, is doing very well. I think the core of the piece we are annualizing is really China, both on the Olay business and on the SK-II business, and as we said, our expectation is that we'll annualize. We don't yet assume a material acceleration in the fiscal year, so I'll leave it there. But again, I think the core of the business is strong, China is the one piece we need to see annualize across the first half. Hey Chris. I'll start and Jon will add. Let me start by saying, I think the China business coming from a double-digit growth trajectory through a significant dip, and we don't expect it to go back to double digits, we expect it over time to go to maybe mid singles, so more in line with what we see in other developed markets. For sure, we don't expect the return to the growth rates that we saw pre-COVID. Many of the effects specifically in China, SK-II, I think the run rate is now stable, so we're already seeing the run rate in terms of absolute volume and absolute dollar sale flattening. What's not yet there is the base period in line with those run rates, so unless we see a significant run rate reduction, that gives us confidence that the annualization would take place. Maybe other point of confidence here, the toughest category to compete in, in China right now is probably baby care. Birth rates are down 15% to 25% depending on how you define the market, and we've been able--the team has been able to grow sales 6% and grow share in the market. Why? Because the portfolio and the innovation the team designed was very specific to the Chinese consumer - their needs, their preference in terms of superiority, and that's driving results. We've been able to grow the Braun business with strong innovation, so there are pockets of business where we are leading the market, and we need to find our way to that across more categories, which we're working on. Fabric care, as I said, is very focused on the profitable part of the portfolio which allows them to drive innovation, which allows them to drive category growth, and that's really what's playing out across categories. But I think the most mechanical driver is run rates are stable and stabilizing, therefore unless we see a further decline in the market, which is entirely possible, but if those run rates hold, that will drive annualization towards the back half of the year. Yes, let me start, Kevin - morning. Generally, what I'd tell you is the--we're happy with the payout that we're seeing in the markets where we can read the payout cleanly, and that's really where 95% of the investment is, meaning Europe focus markets, some of the Europe enterprise markets, Latin America and North America, and I think the top line results support the overall payout of the aggregate of the media spend. We'll obviously go way lower in terms of penetration, and it is probably the strongest push that both Jon and I and Shailesh have as we engage with the businesses to ensure that that spending truly is productive, truly is driving market growth and sales growth, and therefore helps us to deliver top line and bottom line for the quarter and for the fiscal year. If that's no longer the case, then we will change gears and adjust. In terms of overall spend, I'm actually pleased to see increase in media spend and market support that's market constructive. I think it helps the consumer understand the category better. It helps drive penetration, which is still a huge opportunity across multiple categories, so that's very positive. Again, the promotion environment in aggregate remains productive, and as long as those two results in what we see in North America, which is sustained volume growth on the category and sustained value growth on the category, I think we're in a good place. Hey Olivia. I think our job is to lead market growth via irresistible superiority, and that starts with product, package and communication, but it includes value as you point out. I don't see that equation shifting. The competitive environment in terms of promotion is relatively stable. Our approach to promotion is relatively stable across the regions where we have the highest visibility, which is Europe and North America, so I don't view that equation as being different. Again, I think our stance on superiority, which we've talked about now for almost a year, to reset the level of superiority we expect our businesses to deliver, which moves from your job is no longer to just win against the next best competitor in the market but is to create superiority at a level where consumers are drawn into the category, so we create new consumption, we create new consumers coming into the category, increasing their usage or trading up, that's really what we are measuring ourselves against, and I think we're making very good progress and I'm very confident in the innovation pipeline we see for the current year. I'm sure Jon has to add more. On the mid-tier, absolutely our job is to be irresistibly superior at every tier we compete in, and that's why the Luvs innovation is a great example, where--and it's a great example for the strategy at work, because if we are not superior in the mid-tier, the consumer tells us and it shows in the results. So the counter-action to innovate and drive superiority is what we do, and it's really independent of the tier, so at any given point in time, we need to make sure that we deliver all five vectors at every tier, every pack size, every price point in every channel we compete in. Yes, hey Mark. I think your question is specifically on China. I don't think our brand portfolio is something that I would be unhappy with. I think the brand portfolio is strong. When we get it right and when the consumer is willing to engage, I think we show strong progress on baby care even in adverse market conditions. Jon mentioned the progress we see on hair care, on Head & Shoulders and on Pantene. I think the parts of the portfolio where we had our doubts, we made the right choices, so we divested Vidal Sassoon and believe that was the right change in hair care. We have trimmed the fabric care portfolio to ensure that we can focus on the part of the market where we can create value for the consumer and for the company, so I feel good about the product portfolio. The challenge, I think in China, if I may, part of that is the channel shift. Because our footprint was disproportionately developed over 30 years to be a brick and mortar footprint and the digital acceleration obviously with COVID has shifted that into online to a large degree faster than anywhere else in the world, and within that online business, particularly to Douyin, heavily [indiscernible] led and heavily promotion led, and we're taking our time to transition our portfolio to ensure we end up with the right balance between serving consumers in brick and mortar and creating value there, and supporting our brands with the right messaging, equity, price stability and innovation in the online channels. That for me--that is the transition we're still in, but I think that transition is going well and it will show that that portfolio that we operate, I think can sustain mid single growth and value creation in China. Kaumil, it's very hard to predict, obviously, by quarter or H1 versus H2. I think you're in-going hunch is what I would share, as I think the price mix neutralization will continue through H1, and the volume component, I think is relatively stable. As I said, the market is continuing to grow at 2%, price mix has come down to about a point and a half, and I think that's what I would expect from a market growth perspective for the front half. Our objective is, as always, to be within that range, so that's my view; but again, that volatility can be driven by different innovation cycles, it can be driven by different promotion cycles, by channel shifts, so there is a lot of variability within that, but purely extrapolating from what we see in the market today, I think your hunch is right.

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, The Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. The Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong earnings and cash results. The strong results we've delivered in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity, and cash return to shareowners. Specifically on the numbers, organic sales grew 3%. Volume was in line with prior year, showing sequential progress. Pricing contributed 3 points to sales growth as we continue to annualize price increases taken last fiscal year. Mix was neutral to organic sales growth, and growth across categories continues to be broad based with 8 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales in this quarter. Grooming organic sales grew double-digits. Home Care and Hair Care up high singles. Oral Care grew mid-single-digits. Fabric Care, Family Care, Feminine Care and Personal Health Care were up low singles. Skin and Personal Care and Baby Care organic sales were lower versus prior year. Growth was also broad based across geographies. North America, Europe and Asia Pacific focused markets and Latin America and Europe Enterprise markets are each growing organic sales. Global aggregate value share was up versus prior year with 29 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Focus markets grew organic sales 2% for the quarter, and Enterprise Markets grew 4%. Organic sales in North America grew 3% with 3 points of volume growth. Over the last 4 quarters, volume growth in North America has been plus 2%, plus 3%, plus 4%, and now plus 3%. These results include over a point of impact from retail inventory reductions, primarily in personal healthcare. Consumer demand for P&G brands remains very strong in the U.S., with all outlet consumption value growth of 5%, all outlet value share was up 10 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 40 basis points, reflecting continued strong volume growth ahead of the underlying market. The gap between consumer offtake of 5% compared to our U.S. sales growth of 3% reflects the aforementioned trade inventory reductions in the quarter. Europe focus markets were up 7% with 4 points of volume growth. Value share in Europe Focus markets was up 100 basis points over the past 3 months. Latin America organic sales were up 17%. Argentina is a significant contributor to this result given the pricing taken to offset the more than 400% devaluation of the Argentine peso since the start of the year. Mexico and Brazil are annualizing high base periods with organic sales growth in the 20s and 30s, and we expect will normalize back to pre-COVID levels in the mid to high single-digits. As we noted last quarter, there are some specific issues affecting other markets. Those challenges continue to impact results in the quarter. Greater China organic sales were down 10% versus prior year, progress versus the December quarter, but still impacted by weak underlying market conditions and headwinds for SK-II and other Japanese brands in the market. SK-II sales in Greater China were down around 30% for the quarter. We have seen some month to month improvement in overall Greater China sales trends, though we expect it will be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some of the European Enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East. Also, shipments in Russia continue to decline, double digits given our reduced footprint and curtailed investments with consumers and retailers. Combined, the headwinds from Greater China and Asia, Middle East Africa markets were a 150 basis point impact on total company sales for the quarter. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.52 up 11% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core gross margin increased 310 basis points and operating margin increased 90 basis points. Strong productivity improvement of 320 basis points enabled continued strong investment in superior products, packaging and consumer communication to drive market growth. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 220 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 87%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Over 3 quarters, more than $10 billion returned to shareowners in dividends and repurchases. Last week, we announced a 7% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners. This is the 68th consecutive annual dividend increase and 134th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, again, what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall results enabling us to increase our earnings projections for the year and to maintain our guidance ranges for organic sales and cash generation, all while sustaining strong investment. It's a priority to build category consumption and to restore business growth in China and in the Middle East. Our teams continue to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past 5 years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of products, package, brand communication, retail execution and value for each price tier where we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is empowered, agile and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with 4 focus areas: strong progress on Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and a superior employee value equation. These four focus areas are not new or separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. Moving on to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong results year to date enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. We're squarely in the middle of this range fiscal year-to-date. This outlook assumes continued normalization in underlying market growth rates that we've seen over the past few quarters. Markets will be lapping the last waves of cost recovery pricing and volumes slowly begin to recover. We also expect the market level changes we faced through quarter 3 to continue in Q4 though with some directional improvement. On the bottom-line, enabled by 15% core EPS growth year-to-date, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2024 core earnings per share from a range 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. This outlook includes continued strong investments in innovation and brand building to grow markets and extend the superiority of P&G offerings to consumers. We now estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $900 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is a modest improvement versus the outlook we provided last quarter, though nearly all of this benefit has been booked in the first three quarters of the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $600 million after tax for the fiscal year. The change versus prior guidance reflects volatility in Argentina exchange rates, including a period of currency appreciation in quarter three and a revised devaluation outlook for quarter four. We also reflect a reduction in Argentina FX exposure due to the divestiture of our Argentina Fabric and Home Care business, which we completed in mid-March, and reduced assumptions for future volume and pricing given the current rate outlook and recent shipment trends. The net impact of these changes is a relatively modest help to the bottom line, which is reflected in our updated EPS outlook. We expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%, and we expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners for the year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption or major production stoppages are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping a close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain a superior value for consumers and for retailers. The entire P&G organization remains focused on excellent execution of our integrated, market constructive strategy, which has delivered strong results in a challenging operating and competitive environment. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we are confident the best path forward is to double down on this strategy, remain fully invested to drive irresistible superiority across every part of our portfolio and stay focused on delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation for our shareowners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Andre, I want to talk a little bit about market growth versus market share. So first off, if you could just I know you said volatile a few times, but just if you could give us a sense for sort of a high level expectation for global market growth over the next 12 months. And then digging in a little bit more specifically, you shared you offered comments on share performance, particularly in North America and also in Europe focus. But I was curious if you could talk maybe about market share trends or the degree you can tell in China. And maybe let's talk about it excluding SK-II because I think that's an issue unto itself. But just a sense of P&G's performance versus the China market overall. And since it's been lagging for quite a while, arguably, things that you guys are seeing, addressing, doing differently or considering doing differently to sift that trend?\nAndre Schulten: So let me start with overall consumption strength, because it really is and continues to be strong. The consumption trends in the markets are stable despite multiple headwinds, and P&G is growing consumer off take in terms of value share in 29 of our top 50 category country combinations. Globally, we are growing value share by 10 basis points, and the consumption trends are really strong across markets, with few exceptions, which we'll get into. U.S. consumption in quarter three was 5%, and P&G value share is up. So our consumption actually grew ahead of that, both in terms of value and in terms of volume, actually with volume share being up 40 basis points on all outlet in the most recent period. So continued strength in consumption trends in North America and continued strength in terms of P&G performance within that consumption. Europe focused markets consumption is in the range of 8% to 9%, also very strong, and we are growing by more than a share point within that market. Both volume growth very strong with 4 points in the quarter and 3 points of price mix. LA and Europe Enterprise markets are growing, and so the business from a consumption standpoint, which really for us is the most important metric, is in a good place. We continue to deal with very specific headwinds in quarter three that we've discussed already in quarter two, but they continue. There's a soft market consumption in China. We'll get more into that to the second part of your question. SK-II continues to be a headwind in the quarter, and we see some impact from tensions in the Middle East. When you sum it all up, that's about a 1.5 impact on the global top-line. And then we have the inventory reduction in North America, which is about a point on the global top-line as well. And if you put it together, two conclusions. One, the headwinds that we're calling out are temporary in nature. So first of all, the inventory reduction, which is a point on the top-line, we expect that to be a single event, not a continued phenomena to observe. It was mainly driven by Personal Healthcare, because the supply situation is stabilizing after a softer season, so retailers don't need to hold safety stock. And the headwinds in China on SK-II and in the Middle East will ease over time and eventually annualize over the coming quarters. That does not mean that we will ignore any of the headwinds. We are fully focused on accelerating growth in China on SK-II and driving sustainable growth in Asia and Middle East markets, but it explains that we can hold our organic sales growth guidance at 4% to 5%. We're very confident in that and fiscal year-to-date, as we mentioned in the script, we're right at that level. Last point on that topic, we remain fully invested, and the gross margin progress the team has made is actually enabling us to continue to double down on investments, drive market growth and drive our own consumption and share within that. Specifically on China to the second part of your question, Lauren, I think it's a good way to look at China excluding SK-II, as you suggest. We are making sequential progress. The share in the most recent read is flat, and our shipments or our organic sales in China are improving quarter-over-quarter. If we look at quarter two, our organic sales excluding SK-II in China were down 10%. In the most recent quarter, they were down 3%. So we're making progress. The market is not yet recovering, but we see the trajectory going in the right direction. We have pockets of strength. Baby Care, for example, in China has grown 11% in the current quarter, our appliance business growing 14%. We are making strong investments in our hair care business with a more streamlined portfolio, and we feel good about our ability to continue to drive market growth, be market constructive in China, and see the upside as we've articulated before on a longer term on participating in the Chinese market. Will it be a straight line to recovery? No. It probably takes a few more quarters before we turn back to growth, but we see the trend line improving.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Andre, I think you mentioned that nearly all of the commodity benefits that you expected this year you've essentially fully benefited from through the third quarter. And we've seen year-to-date in the calendar year, you're obviously in oil, right, with some plant related costs. So I guess just some thoughts on that in terms of how that impacts your early planning for fiscal '25? And maybe sort of related to that, just your confidence and your view, visibility into the productivity pipeline. And can we expect and do you have confidence you can run at an accelerated cadence of productivity over the next 12 to 18 months as well based on that pipeline? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Keith. Yes. So commodity benefits, as we've mentioned in the script and you correctly state, have been really impacting fiscal year-to-date results. Any remaining change and we see obviously the impact of oil running up a little bit and also other commodities like pulp, for example, where the supply situation is a little bit tighter are coming up. There will be some impact on the current fiscal year, but given flow through of contracts and various holding policies, I expect that to be limited. And we anticipated that within our updated guidance ranges. So no impact to the current fiscal year. Obviously, if spot prices hold, you correctly stated, it will have an impact on next year. But I do feel strongly about our ability, and I think we've proven it over the past 2 years, that with a combination of strong innovation, good reasonable pricing combined with that innovation and strong productivity, whatever comes our way, we'll be able to handle. On the productivity pipeline, I feel very good about where we are. We have now across all businesses a 3-year, what I would call, a productivity master plan, which is something that we invested a lot of energy and time on in each business to make sure that we generate enough ideas, even those that take longer to implement, specifically as we work with our retail partners and we work with our supply chains to really fundamentally improve the efficiency of some of our combined processes. We have great visibility over 3 years. The pipeline is sufficient to what we need it to be. So the part I feel really strong about is productivity. It's fully in our control, and I think the teams are doing a great job creating projects and creating visibility to a very strong pipeline over the coming years.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Andre, I was hoping if you can elaborate a little bit more on the flat price mix in the U.S. in fiscal 3Q. If are you seeing any downside within your portfolio? Or is that self-inflicted as you offer, more IGM on the lower price points or anything about packing that we shouldn't be aware of and also related to that I saw you, you mentioned in your leaves about the price related volume declines in Baby Care. Is that mostly China? Is there anything you can elaborate? Or is that also the U.S? And I think to Steve's commentary about commodities and question about commodities, anything you can talk to us regarding the lag that we're going to see that coming through into fiscal '25?\nAndre Schulten: Look, the flat price mix contribution to organic sales growth in the U.S. is an outcome of simply annualizing the price increases that we had taken in previous periods. That was anticipated and it's consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the construction of the market growth across the U.S. The volume component is coming up, getting closer to about 2%, and the value component is coming down. Different players have priced at different points. So that's really the differential between market and us. There is no trade down of note that I that we can observe. Private label shares, value shares are actually very stable, 16.4% past 1 month and 16.4% past 12 months. So consumers are not trading down within the U.S. towards private label. And if anything, we continue to see when consumers trade into P&G, which they continue to do because both volume share up strongly in the U.S. and value share up. Once they trade into P&G propositions, they continue to trade up actually within those propositions, be it from liquid detergent to unit dose to power pods. So we continue to observe that. So no worries in terms of trade down. On Baby specifically, look, Baby is annualizing a very strong base period and obviously was heavily exposed to the commodity run up and therefore took pricing and in combination with productivity and strong innovation. The volume decline, I would say, is really differential by region. If you look at China, the business is growing very strongly. It's actually 11% growth in the quarter, share growth of more than a point in China, and that's with birth rates contracting. So the portfolio strength in China is remarkable. When I look at the U.S., the premium tier, so when you look at swaddlers, you look at cruisers and cruisers 360, those tiers we have been innovating in very strongly over the past 12, 15 months, and they are growing. They are growing share, and they are growing sales. Where we have an opportunity in the U.S. is on the mid-tier. On Luvs, for example, we have not been able to push the full innovation pipeline out for different reasons, and that's what the team really is focused on to reestablish superiority on those few businesses where we feel that we let value get a little bit out of sync with what the consumer needs. But the plans are there, so now it's a matter of execution. So I feel very good overall about the baby care business, strong innovation pipeline, and that I think will address the isolated superiority gaps that we might have. On commodities, it's very difficult to say when they would actually flow through. I think it's safe to say that there's at least 60 to 90 days of delay. Many of the commodities will take longer to flow through simply because of contract structures that use certain trigger points or holding periods. So I would say at least 60 to 90 days, for many of them probably longer. The only one that tends to flow through quickly is fuel diesel, obviously, because it's captured in transportation.\nOperator: The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: We just touched on pricing. Maybe we can switch to the volume side. Can you just talk about your level of visibility and perhaps a bit of magnitude that you're expecting in Q4 in terms of returning to volume growth going forward? Obviously, a flat result this quarter, but there were some items that depressed volume, they get better going forward in terms of U.S. inventory, SK-II weakness, etcetera. So just looking for some perspective going forward, particularly as pricing presumably continues to decelerate a bit. And also maybe you can just touch on given the heavy marketing this year, presumably with the SG&A increases, the level of payback and ROI you think you're getting on that higher marketing in terms of volume?\nAndre Schulten: On the volume side, look, I think the effects that we described that are holding us back in the current quarter, the inventory effect in the U.S. of 2 points, which is a point on a global basis, I don't expect that to hold. So I expect the U.S. to continue to grow in terms of volume beyond the 3% that we're seeing in the current quarter. I expect some of the negative headwinds in China, the Middle East and SK-II hopefully will improve sequentially. But in aggregate, I fully expect the markets to continue to recover, shift more towards volume growth as we've seen consistently over the recent periods. And since we're growing or holding volume share in most geographies that will also flow into our results. So sequential progress on volumes, many open questions still, but I expect the line to point upwards. On marketing spend, you're right. We continue to invest in reach frequency with strong quality of communication across the markets. We are very diligent in pre ROI analysis and very diligent in post event analysis to ensure that we understand whether the spending is effective. And if you look at the results, I would argue it is. The strongest combinations of great product innovation with a very sharp consumer insight translated into a great copy drives strong results. So if you look, for example, at our Skin and Personal Care business, Old Spice and Secret total body deodorant, great consumer insight, great product, great packaging, strong communication, and the business is growing 11% in North America. If you look at our home care portfolio, those are categories that are expandable. Swiffer PowerMop, for example, getting new users to use Febreze plug-ins, those marketing investments grow the market, and they grow our share within the market. So expandable categories is a big investment area for us. So we continue to drive high levels of discipline. We will not spend if there's no ROI. And you're right, we're watching the same and asking the same question to ensure that we remain on the right side of that line.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : Maybe, Andre, just to pick up on that last point. I guess if we think about year-to-date and I guess as it translates to the full year in the base, we have some headwinds that shouldn't recur, right? The weakness in Corporate Chemicals, the destock that you just mentioned, SK-II, I guess being more negative than overall market in China for the reasons we know. So I guess as we kind of think about next year, right, and confidence in being able to be in line with long-term organic sales targets. Does the comps make it easier? Should we be thinking about the macro environment maybe not being supportive? Just try to put some context around the organic sales growth this quarter, which decelerated from the last quarter and just is there anything we should be thinking about as we move we start thinking about our models for next year?\nAndre Schulten: I would point first to the market growth expectation, which we said we expect markets to be in the range of 3% to 4% in terms of value growth. And that will be a combination of 2 points of volume and 1 to 2 points of price mix. That is still our assumption. Our role per our growth algorithm is to be growing slightly ahead of that by driving market growth, which in turn will drive share and a bigger part of us leading the market. So that would be my answer. On the current fiscal year, obviously, by reiterating guidance of 4% to 5% and being right in the middle of that range fiscal year-to-date. That means mathematically we expect quarter four to be in the 4% to 5% range. And if you project that out, I think with the market growth dynamic I was describing, I think that will give you a good starting point for next fiscal year.\nOperator: The next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog : I just had a quick clarification on your guidance. You maintained your FY '24 organic sales growth of 4% to 5%, but that implies a step up of growth in Q4 to get to the high end of your range. So I guess I wanted to clarify if you still expect to be at the high end or should we assume coming in at maybe the midpoint of your top-line guide for the year is more realistic? And then maybe just a quick question on your SG&A expense, which did step up quite a bit during the quarter. So just maybe hoping for a little more color on the drivers of this.\nAndre Schulten: We did not reiterate the top end of the range, but we reiterated the range. And that means 5% is still possible. Is it probable? I don't know. Probably more 50-50 than it was before. So the range is valid. I wouldn't point today at the top end of the range. On the SG&A line, we continue to invest in marketing as we discussed in previous question, and we really saw an increase in our marketing spend of about 14% year-over-year. That's the main driver. It's offset by productivity on the SG&A line, but really I would point to continued investment, productive investments to drive market growth and push out our innovation and that's the main driver of the SG&A increase that you're seeing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: My question is about mix, which flattened out this quarter after about a year and a half of improvement. So, clearly, you guys have been adamant that we're not seeing trade down. But, as you look at this, how much of that is trade up is just harder to do now? You've obviously done you've been very successful all of late with Powerwash and EZ-Squeeze and Paws, etcetera, etcetera. So is that becoming harder? And could you talk about mix expectations over perhaps the next 12 months?\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. I don't think the fundamental dynamic in terms of consumers trading into the P&G portfolio and trading up is changing. We've not observed it over the past 2 years, and we've not seen it in the most recent period. There are some drivers and headwinds to mix. The biggest headwind I would mention is SK-II being down 30%. It's our highest value per or one of the highest value per unit items, and that obviously has a material impact on mix. Outside of that, we really don't see in any of the regions a significant down trading within our portfolio. As I mentioned, in the U.S., we continue to see trade up. Actually, the premium tiers on baby care doing better. I mentioned that in the context of Love. So we continue to think that the way that we innovate, providing value with innovation and showing the superiority of our premium items in the portfolio is resonating with consumers. And as long as we do that and as long as that value is real and tangible for consumers, I think we can hold on to that mix trend that we've seen consistently.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Just regarding the, just one quick follow-up on the organic sales range for the full year. The slight change and I know the range is still in scope. Can you just frame maybe how much of that was the inventory dynamics in the U.S., maybe a little bit less pricing in Argentina versus anything that has fundamentally developed through the quarter? And just connected to that, if you could, you mentioned the elasticity dynamics in Baby and Feminine Care in the press release. Can you just comment on what you're seeing from a broader perspective, specifically as you may need to contemplate some incremental pricing next year with the moves we're seeing on the cost side?\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, Chris. I think you gave the answer on the organic sales line. It's exactly that. I think Argentina, as we said, peso requires a little less pricing. That's an impact on organic sales, and the business is also smaller and responding maybe more aggressively to the pricing. So that is one building block. The other building block, I think is the biggest one is really the U.S. inventory reduction. So as I think about the step up that we need to see in order to be within that 4% to 5% range, we assume that that inventory reduction is a one timer, and that's what we expect in the guidance range. The elasticity in general is not changing. I think we've done and you see it in the results, I think the teams have done a very good job of making sure that we maintain a healthy value equation for our retail partners and our consumers with strong innovation, with pricing, only pricing where necessary, balancing pricing with strong productivity. So I do feel overall the business is responding very favorably even after we had to take the pricing that we took. The volume is coming up as we would have expected both in the market and for P&G. And in our biggest geographies, we're growing volume share consistently. So I do feel overall the elasticity is doing well. Baby is a very elastic category. And especially, as I mentioned, if we've not been able to consistently innovate across all tiers. And that actually is a confirmation of the model. So where we've not been able to push the innovation out and hold the full level of superiority as we took pricing, the consumer is responding. And we know the answer to that, which is push the innovation that we know how to do and communicate as a priority, and I'm confident that we'll recover the elasticity here. I don't see a broader issue. Actually, I see a lot of upside with the strength of the innovation pipeline going into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\nCallum Elliott: I wanted to come back please to Andrea's question on trade down. I think, Andre, you had pointed to the stable private label market share as a sign that there is no trade down. And I want to push back on that a bit. I think we all know that the consumers under the most pressure at the moment are the low income consumers, many of whom were probably already using private label products in the first place. And so my question is, is it not possible that volume reductions and cutbacks amongst the low income cohorts sort of who were already using private label a year ago are offsetting the trade down impacts and sort of masking that trade down in that flat market share number that you're talking about. And that could also explain why category growth has weakened so much. And I guess just to add to the question, I'm surprised that the private label market share is the metric that you're pointing to justify lack of trade down. And I'm just wondering, do you not track consumers longitudinally over time to measure trade down and what consumers are doing? And is private label market share really the best metric that we have to track this?\nAndre Schulten: Look, I'd be worried that the phenomena you're describing would be a driver if, A, the volume in the market wasn't growing, which it is, and if we weren't able to grow volume share, but only grow value share. So I don't think that's the case. We're growing volume share. The market is growing in terms of volume. And one of the hypotheses I would have for you is that a lot of our consumers are actually not switching with private label heavily at this point in time. On the metrics that we use, look, private label share is the most visible metric that we can point to and it's also visible to you. So it's one that is convenient to use and objectively verifiable. So that's why we're using it. Internally, obviously, we use a lot more detail. We track exact consumption by tier, by product form, by retail channel. We check our share versus competitive share at that level of detail. So there's a lot more internal discussion on do we see trade down within our portfolio, do we see trade down across our portfolio with competitors to lower tiers. But private label is just the most visible and robust measure that we can point to that is visible to you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: I wanted to go back to the U.S. market. The 5% consumption level was pretty strong and we see in track channel data. Are you expecting from a reported standpoint to get closer to that level in Q4 as you don't have the negative impact from the inventory? Or what are the puts and takes in Q4? And then just specifically on laundry in the U.S., your largest category? There was some recalls in Tide PODS recently, so maybe you could talk about any potential impact from that in Q4. And then longer term, you announced the innovation on Tide EVO, so maybe some color on the rollout of that brand and the product and your expectations?\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Hi, Filippo. You're right. We hope U.S. market growth continues in the high 4s, low 5s, and I think the trend line is pointing in that direction. And unless we see any major inventory reduction, I would expect us to continue to trend in that same direction. We are driving market growth in most of our categories in the U.S., and that should mathematically then result in stable to increasing shares both on the volume and value side. And that's certainly the objective the team has on all the U.S. businesses. The laundry recall, it was a very limited recall on a packaging defect on 1 SKU on Tight PODS. Out of an abundance of caution, the team decided to recall the product. It's no impact or very limited impact actually on the quarter or the fiscal year. And again, that product itself is safe, so no issue with the product. It was a small packaging defect, but in any case, the team decided to go ahead and recall. We're very excited about the EVO innovation. The fiber spinning innovation has been one of our core developments, so seeing it in market is exciting, but it's very early. So we run these test markets to validate product market fit, validate the commercial execution, validate everything from packaging color to packaging sizes. And it'll take us a few months before we have anything of substance. But yes, the innovation is very exciting, but it will take time before it has an impact on overall laundry growth in the U.S.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Two follow ups. First, can you talk a little bit more about Europe, very strong market and your results have been extremely strong. So perhaps what's driving the strength of the market, your market share gains? And is this something that you think can flow through into 2025? And then second, kind of coming back on China, there's been significant channel shifts that we're noticing certainly in the beauty area. It's 50% to 60% online with TikTok being half of that. So kind of number 1, wondering to what extent you're adapting to that and are prepared to adapt to that shift? And then second, for the non-beauty business, do you also see the online business moving to TikTok as well? And maybe talk about your share online and off line in those categories, the main categories in China?\nAndre Schulten: Indeed, Europe results have been outstanding. Aggregate Europe between Europe focused markets and Europe enterprise markets, we now have, I think, 12 consecutive quarters of 5% or higher growth, which is outstanding. I think the strength of the business maybe let me focus on the focus markets here for a minute. The strength of the business has been consistent because of the execution of the team, strong innovation pushed out over an extended period of time as we were taking pricing, very strong productivity work in the region across every part of the P&L to limit the amount of pricing we needed to take but brilliant execution of the pricing that was taken, respecting key price points, respecting retailers and consumer constraints, and I think that's playing out. We've also invested very strongly probably more than ever in terms of marketing support of those innovations in the focus markets. And we are building the same digital capability in terms of consumer targeting to become more effective and efficient with our spend in Europe that we've used in the U.S. for an extended period of time. So all of those would be contributors to growth. On the enterprise market side, I would caution it's not without headwinds. Russia continues to be a headwind that we called out with a reduced portfolio and very little support of the business. We have work to do in Turkey as Turkey recovers from the heavy inflation based pricing and some of the Middle East outflow of tensions. So it's not without headwinds, but I think the underlying performance of the European business continues to be strong, and it's built the right way. You're correct on the channel shifting in China. Obviously, Douyin is a significant driver, most heavily probably in beauty. We've been talking about this before. What we want to make sure is we keep a healthy balance between building brand equity versus simply low funnel transactional execution via KOLs that only make sales via deep discounting, but don't do anything for the brand equity or for our superiority messaging. That's what we're doing. We're building brand houses on Douyin. We're making sure that we have a good balance between transactional communication and equity communication. We have innovation that is launching on Douyin First, Head and Shoulders Premium would be a good example of most recent innovations. So we're playing in the channel, but we're playing with a sense of value creation and balance between top-line growth and profitability. The channel is relevant for other parts of the business as well and the same principles apply. We are careful to ensure that we are balanced across top line and bottom-line, and we protect and grow underlying brand equity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and hope you're doing well. Maybe one quick housekeeping. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of the stronger earnings guidance was related to the improvement in FX? Andre, I know the FX guidance became more favorable, but I think you also mentioned you're reducing your exposure due to divestiture Argentina. So I just want to make sure I understand the moving pieces as it relates to the FX impact on the earnings range. And then just a quick follow-up on SK-II in China, I think month to month improvement was mentioned. So just any color you can provide on the exit rate relative to the 30% decline in the quarter, I think would be pretty helpful.\nAndre Schulten: Okay. Good morning, Peter. Yes, the foreign exchange held was an interesting one because the $400 million reduction, as we said, was all related to Argentina. And we had assumed in the previous guidance that whatever exposure is generated in Argentina will have to be offset with pricing within the fiscal year in Argentina. So as the assumption changes and the business size reduces, the net outcome to the P&L is very limited. So yes, we saw a technical reduction because of the improving peso and the lower size or smaller size of the business. The net effect to the P&L will be very limited because of the underlying assumption we made from the very beginning that we would offset that impact of FX via pricing in the market. SK-II in China is, I think bottoming out in terms of the shipment pattern. As we said, we are about 30% down in the quarter. It's very encouraging to see some positive signs in terms of consumer sentiment as the team continues to innovate. The team drives very strong communication on the core benefit space of the SK-II proposition focusing on PITERA as a core ingredient and reason to believe. We are leveraging continue to leveraging the core consumer in China, very loyal to the brand, to amplify that messaging and it's starting to resonate. So we see positive signs. It will take time until that translates into shipments though. I think retailers are sitting on a little bit of stock, and I think they will be hesitant to order until they see good signs of consumption increases. So I would caution, I don't expect this to be a fast recovery. This will take some time. Maybe last point on SK-II. Outside of China, the business is doing very well. We're growing double digits in Japan, so I think the fundamental proposition is healthy. We just have to sort through this period in China. And again, we're pointing, I think, in the right direction, but it will take time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Just a few, kind of housekeeping items. Andre, just wanted to confirm that the destocking in the U.S. was isolated to the consumer health business. And then the other 2 questions I had, what the Tide EVO, the technology that you've developed, would that be applicable to other brands and, other cleaning solutions within the P&G portfolio? And then just the final thing is, I think there's a lot of the theme I'm hearing is broadly from speaking to investors along this call is the delta between obviously how P&G is performing and how the how everyone else is performing. And, you know, I think the competition that that you're dealing with, I think, generally are struggling, for volume growth. So as you think about guidance, you know, how much have you contemplated a step up in competitive spend? Right? I understand the fact that you guys have the momentum and you're gaining share and the innovation is working. But I just wanted to get an understanding of kind of how measured your guidance is in relation to potential competitive response.\nAndre Schulten: Destocking in the U.S. was broadly personal healthcare related. That was the biggest effect in, again, an okay season, but significantly weaker than last year and generally an industry wide recovery of the supply chain. So if you're a retailer, you no longer see the need to hold safety stock. You're convinced that when the season restarts and you need product, you can order and you get it. There was some of that also in the Tampax business, in the tampon business, as we have stabilized the supply chain there, similar dynamic. And there was a little bit of destocking in Hair Care, because we had up stocking in the base, but the majority of it, to keep it simple, is healthcare. Indeed, the EVO technology, so the fiber spinning technology, is a technology that can be applied in broader context. We've applied it to facial cleaning in beauty, and there are many other applications. This is one of our platform technologies, if you think about it. The ability to spin chemistry into a fiber and avoid water as a carrying agent has so many efficiencies and advantages in the chemistry that we can put together and obviously in the logistics and cost side that, yes, we would want to apply it. But step by step, we got to make sure the EVO's proposition works well, and that's why we're in test market, and we talked about this earlier. Competitive spending, if done the right way, would be a good thing. If we see competitors innovate, if we see competitors communicate in market constructive ways, drive incremental spend in marketing dollars, that's a good thing. So we hope to see that. On the promotion side, we don't really see a dynamic that would point to anyone escalating promotion. We see stable depth of promotion in Europe, a little bit of increase in frequency. In the U.S., we are operating at about 85% business sold on deal, which 85 index versus pre-COVID level, sorry, that's about 29% of business volume sold on deal. And we see competitors at similar ranges, so and it's stable over a period of time. So again, if we see market constructive spend, great. Nobody seems to have an interest in heavy promotion at this point in time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I guess as we get towards the end of the call, putting a lot of it together, lots of information on volume, on organic revenue, also why it should get better sequentially. I think putting that in the context of what your earnings have grown year-to-date versus the guidance of 10 to 11 implying almost a flat 4Q, I think that suggests a very significant step up in reinvestment or maybe in something else. So can you maybe just try to reconcile each of those pieces?\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Kaumil, the main driver here is the profile of some of the tailwinds and headwinds. I don't expect a major step up in spend quarter over quarter. I think we will sustain good investment levels. And again, as I said, we will be ROI driven, so it's up to the teams. But I don't expect a step up as the main explanation of why Q4 looks different in terms of EPS growth. The main driver is a lot of the commodity help has been booked in the front half of the year. And if anything, there's a little commodity herd coming in Q4. As we talked, oil potentially as reflected in diesel rates and maybe some of the pulp impact will hit this fiscal year. And then the foreign exchange rate, so forget about Argentina. I think we've discussed that. But the balance of the foreign exchange rate will mostly hit in the second half, and that's heavily in quarter four. And then the last element is just base period. So Q4 last year was very strong because of a different profile. This profile looks a little bit different for the reasons I explained. But don't expect a material change in spend behavior. It's really more of the macro drivers that impact the profile.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: One follow-up on SK-II. Last quarter, you talked about your research suggesting that brand sentiment was improving. I didn't hear that. I guess, is that still the case? You're still doing more work on what's going on, I guess, specific to what's happening in China? And then more broadly, reinvestment has just been considerable this year, obviously, because gross margin has expanded, at least in part because gross margin has expanded so much and allows you to do that. As you think about the setup from here, commodities unknown, but probably not as big of a tailwind, net, net and pricing clearly not as big of a tailwind as it's been. So as you go into next year and you presumably have a little less gross margin to play with, how do you think about what the reinvestment levels look like? And then what is the contribution? I mean, I know it's a squishy question, but how much contribution do you think you've had from 300 plus basis points of reinvestment back in the business to drive share, volume, value, etcetera? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Mark, on SK-II, I think the brand sentiment has been sequentially improving. The work the team is doing on innovation, on communication and credentialing, I think, is resonating with the consumer. And as the overall sentiment towards Japanese brands is improving, we are also getting a bit more bold in the breadth of the communication, the reach and frequency that we use. So I think all of that is pointing in the right direction. As I mentioned, I think the order behavior might lag, so we might see improvement in consumption before we see improvement in shipment. So that's why I was cautioning that while we see consumer sentiment improving, that first has to translate in increased consumption, and that then has to translate into increased orders and shipment, and that will take some time. So the team is doing the right work, and I'm glad they're actually doing it in a very balanced way to ensure that we're rebuilding this brand for the long-term. In terms of spending, I think this will really be done business by business, geography by geography, so it's hard to give you an answer. The only thing I'd point to is we are planning on significant productivity to continue in the marketing spend area. So that in and of itself would be somewhere between $400 million and $500 million of productivity in the space. That is always up for discussion. Do you reinvest or do you flow it through. And it will really depend on the level of innovation we are able to drive. More innovation means more spend and hopefully better return. And I'll leave it at that in terms of the ROI. I think I've answered the question before. It's there in the aggregate discipline of the categories, but I wouldn't want to go into more detail. I think it's really down to the category country combinations at which we measure it, and at which those decisions are made.\nOperator: Today's final question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: And I wanted to follow on Nik's question. Over the last few quarters, some of your peers, your competitors have talked about elevating their rates of growth. You touched on this a bit before, but I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity or capacity for category growth rates to elevate further if more players are deploying strategy than you execute. And how do we see that come through with respect to volume or price or mix? And then just finally, if there's anything that you need to do with respect to elevating innovation more or do anything in light of what may be a more competitive environment on that front? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Look, I think if more of our competitors adopt a market constructive strategy and innovate and spend in that way, that's good for everyone. And if you look at the category development globally, there's still so much opportunity to grow even in the most developed markets to grow category penetration in places like fabric enhancers. So that is a big opportunity in many of the markets where we play. The category development index is index 30 or maybe slightly higher. So there's plenty of opportunity to be market constructive, so that's a good thing. We are constantly looking at our superiority and our innovation. That's inherent in the strategy of irresistible superiority. So we've talked about resetting the bar. We've done that with exactly that in mind, what will it take for us to continue to be market constructive, win consumers for the next 5 years instead of just looking back at the success we had over the past 5 years. So that is part of the growth model and part of how the organization operates.\nAndre Schulten: All right. Thank you for your time today. If you have additional questions, John, myself will be available during the day. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong earnings and cash results. The strong results we've delivered in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity, and cash return to shareowners. Specifically on the numbers, organic sales grew 3%. Volume was in line with prior year, showing sequential progress. Pricing contributed 3 points to sales growth as we continue to annualize price increases taken last fiscal year. Mix was neutral to organic sales growth, and growth across categories continues to be broad based with 8 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales in this quarter. Grooming organic sales grew double-digits. Home Care and Hair Care up high singles. Oral Care grew mid-single-digits. Fabric Care, Family Care, Feminine Care and Personal Health Care were up low singles. Skin and Personal Care and Baby Care organic sales were lower versus prior year. Growth was also broad based across geographies. North America, Europe and Asia Pacific focused markets and Latin America and Europe Enterprise markets are each growing organic sales. Global aggregate value share was up versus prior year with 29 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Focus markets grew organic sales 2% for the quarter, and Enterprise Markets grew 4%. Organic sales in North America grew 3% with 3 points of volume growth. Over the last 4 quarters, volume growth in North America has been plus 2%, plus 3%, plus 4%, and now plus 3%. These results include over a point of impact from retail inventory reductions, primarily in personal healthcare. Consumer demand for P&G brands remains very strong in the U.S., with all outlet consumption value growth of 5%, all outlet value share was up 10 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 40 basis points, reflecting continued strong volume growth ahead of the underlying market. The gap between consumer offtake of 5% compared to our U.S. sales growth of 3% reflects the aforementioned trade inventory reductions in the quarter. Europe focus markets were up 7% with 4 points of volume growth. Value share in Europe Focus markets was up 100 basis points over the past 3 months. Latin America organic sales were up 17%. Argentina is a significant contributor to this result given the pricing taken to offset the more than 400% devaluation of the Argentine peso since the start of the year. Mexico and Brazil are annualizing high base periods with organic sales growth in the 20s and 30s, and we expect will normalize back to pre-COVID levels in the mid to high single-digits. As we noted last quarter, there are some specific issues affecting other markets. Those challenges continue to impact results in the quarter. Greater China organic sales were down 10% versus prior year, progress versus the December quarter, but still impacted by weak underlying market conditions and headwinds for SK-II and other Japanese brands in the market. SK-II sales in Greater China were down around 30% for the quarter. We have seen some month to month improvement in overall Greater China sales trends, though we expect it will be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some of the European Enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East. Also, shipments in Russia continue to decline, double digits given our reduced footprint and curtailed investments with consumers and retailers. Combined, the headwinds from Greater China and Asia, Middle East Africa markets were a 150 basis point impact on total company sales for the quarter. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.52 up 11% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core gross margin increased 310 basis points and operating margin increased 90 basis points. Strong productivity improvement of 320 basis points enabled continued strong investment in superior products, packaging and consumer communication to drive market growth. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 220 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 87%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Over 3 quarters, more than $10 billion returned to shareowners in dividends and repurchases. Last week, we announced a 7% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners. This is the 68th consecutive annual dividend increase and 134th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, again, what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall results enabling us to increase our earnings projections for the year and to maintain our guidance ranges for organic sales and cash generation, all while sustaining strong investment. It's a priority to build category consumption and to restore business growth in China and in the Middle East. Our teams continue to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past 5 years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of products, package, brand communication, retail execution and value for each price tier where we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is empowered, agile and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with 4 focus areas: strong progress on Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and a superior employee value equation. These four focus areas are not new or separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. Moving on to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong results year to date enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. We're squarely in the middle of this range fiscal year-to-date. This outlook assumes continued normalization in underlying market growth rates that we've seen over the past few quarters. Markets will be lapping the last waves of cost recovery pricing and volumes slowly begin to recover. We also expect the market level changes we faced through quarter 3 to continue in Q4 though with some directional improvement. On the bottom-line, enabled by 15% core EPS growth year-to-date, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2024 core earnings per share from a range 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. This outlook includes continued strong investments in innovation and brand building to grow markets and extend the superiority of P&G offerings to consumers. We now estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $900 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is a modest improvement versus the outlook we provided last quarter, though nearly all of this benefit has been booked in the first three quarters of the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $600 million after tax for the fiscal year. The change versus prior guidance reflects volatility in Argentina exchange rates, including a period of currency appreciation in quarter three and a revised devaluation outlook for quarter four. We also reflect a reduction in Argentina FX exposure due to the divestiture of our Argentina Fabric and Home Care business, which we completed in mid-March, and reduced assumptions for future volume and pricing given the current rate outlook and recent shipment trends. The net impact of these changes is a relatively modest help to the bottom line, which is reflected in our updated EPS outlook. We expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%, and we expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners for the year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption or major production stoppages are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping a close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain a superior value for consumers and for retailers. The entire P&G organization remains focused on excellent execution of our integrated, market constructive strategy, which has delivered strong results in a challenging operating and competitive environment. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we are confident the best path forward is to double down on this strategy, remain fully invested to drive irresistible superiority across every part of our portfolio and stay focused on delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation for our shareowners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So let me start with overall consumption strength, because it really is and continues to be strong. The consumption trends in the markets are stable despite multiple headwinds, and P&G is growing consumer off take in terms of value share in 29 of our top 50 category country combinations. Globally, we are growing value share by 10 basis points, and the consumption trends are really strong across markets, with few exceptions, which we'll get into. U.S. consumption in quarter three was 5%, and P&G value share is up. So our consumption actually grew ahead of that, both in terms of value and in terms of volume, actually with volume share being up 40 basis points on all outlet in the most recent period. So continued strength in consumption trends in North America and continued strength in terms of P&G performance within that consumption. Europe focused markets consumption is in the range of 8% to 9%, also very strong, and we are growing by more than a share point within that market. Both volume growth very strong with 4 points in the quarter and 3 points of price mix. LA and Europe Enterprise markets are growing, and so the business from a consumption standpoint, which really for us is the most important metric, is in a good place. We continue to deal with very specific headwinds in quarter three that we've discussed already in quarter two, but they continue. There's a soft market consumption in China. We'll get more into that to the second part of your question. SK-II continues to be a headwind in the quarter, and we see some impact from tensions in the Middle East. When you sum it all up, that's about a 1.5 impact on the global top-line. And then we have the inventory reduction in North America, which is about a point on the global top-line as well. And if you put it together, two conclusions. One, the headwinds that we're calling out are temporary in nature. So first of all, the inventory reduction, which is a point on the top-line, we expect that to be a single event, not a continued phenomena to observe. It was mainly driven by Personal Healthcare, because the supply situation is stabilizing after a softer season, so retailers don't need to hold safety stock. And the headwinds in China on SK-II and in the Middle East will ease over time and eventually annualize over the coming quarters. That does not mean that we will ignore any of the headwinds. We are fully focused on accelerating growth in China on SK-II and driving sustainable growth in Asia and Middle East markets, but it explains that we can hold our organic sales growth guidance at 4% to 5%. We're very confident in that and fiscal year-to-date, as we mentioned in the script, we're right at that level. Last point on that topic, we remain fully invested, and the gross margin progress the team has made is actually enabling us to continue to double down on investments, drive market growth and drive our own consumption and share within that. Specifically on China to the second part of your question, Lauren, I think it's a good way to look at China excluding SK-II, as you suggest. We are making sequential progress. The share in the most recent read is flat, and our shipments or our organic sales in China are improving quarter-over-quarter. If we look at quarter two, our organic sales excluding SK-II in China were down 10%. In the most recent quarter, they were down 3%. So we're making progress. The market is not yet recovering, but we see the trajectory going in the right direction. We have pockets of strength. Baby Care, for example, in China has grown 11% in the current quarter, our appliance business growing 14%. We are making strong investments in our hair care business with a more streamlined portfolio, and we feel good about our ability to continue to drive market growth, be market constructive in China, and see the upside as we've articulated before on a longer term on participating in the Chinese market. Will it be a straight line to recovery? No. It probably takes a few more quarters before we turn back to growth, but we see the trend line improving. Good morning, Keith. Yes. So commodity benefits, as we've mentioned in the script and you correctly state, have been really impacting fiscal year-to-date results. Any remaining change and we see obviously the impact of oil running up a little bit and also other commodities like pulp, for example, where the supply situation is a little bit tighter are coming up. There will be some impact on the current fiscal year, but given flow through of contracts and various holding policies, I expect that to be limited. And we anticipated that within our updated guidance ranges. So no impact to the current fiscal year. Obviously, if spot prices hold, you correctly stated, it will have an impact on next year. But I do feel strongly about our ability, and I think we've proven it over the past 2 years, that with a combination of strong innovation, good reasonable pricing combined with that innovation and strong productivity, whatever comes our way, we'll be able to handle. On the productivity pipeline, I feel very good about where we are. We have now across all businesses a 3-year, what I would call, a productivity master plan, which is something that we invested a lot of energy and time on in each business to make sure that we generate enough ideas, even those that take longer to implement, specifically as we work with our retail partners and we work with our supply chains to really fundamentally improve the efficiency of some of our combined processes. We have great visibility over 3 years. The pipeline is sufficient to what we need it to be. So the part I feel really strong about is productivity. It's fully in our control, and I think the teams are doing a great job creating projects and creating visibility to a very strong pipeline over the coming years. Look, the flat price mix contribution to organic sales growth in the U.S. is an outcome of simply annualizing the price increases that we had taken in previous periods. That was anticipated and it's consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the construction of the market growth across the U.S. The volume component is coming up, getting closer to about 2%, and the value component is coming down. Different players have priced at different points. So that's really the differential between market and us. There is no trade down of note that I that we can observe. Private label shares, value shares are actually very stable, 16.4% past 1 month and 16.4% past 12 months. So consumers are not trading down within the U.S. towards private label. And if anything, we continue to see when consumers trade into P&G, which they continue to do because both volume share up strongly in the U.S. and value share up. Once they trade into P&G propositions, they continue to trade up actually within those propositions, be it from liquid detergent to unit dose to power pods. So we continue to observe that. So no worries in terms of trade down. On Baby specifically, look, Baby is annualizing a very strong base period and obviously was heavily exposed to the commodity run up and therefore took pricing and in combination with productivity and strong innovation. The volume decline, I would say, is really differential by region. If you look at China, the business is growing very strongly. It's actually 11% growth in the quarter, share growth of more than a point in China, and that's with birth rates contracting. So the portfolio strength in China is remarkable. When I look at the U.S., the premium tier, so when you look at swaddlers, you look at cruisers and cruisers 360, those tiers we have been innovating in very strongly over the past 12, 15 months, and they are growing. They are growing share, and they are growing sales. Where we have an opportunity in the U.S. is on the mid-tier. On Luvs, for example, we have not been able to push the full innovation pipeline out for different reasons, and that's what the team really is focused on to reestablish superiority on those few businesses where we feel that we let value get a little bit out of sync with what the consumer needs. But the plans are there, so now it's a matter of execution. So I feel very good overall about the baby care business, strong innovation pipeline, and that I think will address the isolated superiority gaps that we might have. On commodities, it's very difficult to say when they would actually flow through. I think it's safe to say that there's at least 60 to 90 days of delay. Many of the commodities will take longer to flow through simply because of contract structures that use certain trigger points or holding periods. So I would say at least 60 to 90 days, for many of them probably longer. The only one that tends to flow through quickly is fuel diesel, obviously, because it's captured in transportation. On the volume side, look, I think the effects that we described that are holding us back in the current quarter, the inventory effect in the U.S. of 2 points, which is a point on a global basis, I don't expect that to hold. So I expect the U.S. to continue to grow in terms of volume beyond the 3% that we're seeing in the current quarter. I expect some of the negative headwinds in China, the Middle East and SK-II hopefully will improve sequentially. But in aggregate, I fully expect the markets to continue to recover, shift more towards volume growth as we've seen consistently over the recent periods. And since we're growing or holding volume share in most geographies that will also flow into our results. So sequential progress on volumes, many open questions still, but I expect the line to point upwards. On marketing spend, you're right. We continue to invest in reach frequency with strong quality of communication across the markets. We are very diligent in pre ROI analysis and very diligent in post event analysis to ensure that we understand whether the spending is effective. And if you look at the results, I would argue it is. The strongest combinations of great product innovation with a very sharp consumer insight translated into a great copy drives strong results. So if you look, for example, at our Skin and Personal Care business, Old Spice and Secret total body deodorant, great consumer insight, great product, great packaging, strong communication, and the business is growing 11% in North America. If you look at our home care portfolio, those are categories that are expandable. Swiffer PowerMop, for example, getting new users to use Febreze plug-ins, those marketing investments grow the market, and they grow our share within the market. So expandable categories is a big investment area for us. So we continue to drive high levels of discipline. We will not spend if there's no ROI. And you're right, we're watching the same and asking the same question to ensure that we remain on the right side of that line. I would point first to the market growth expectation, which we said we expect markets to be in the range of 3% to 4% in terms of value growth. And that will be a combination of 2 points of volume and 1 to 2 points of price mix. That is still our assumption. Our role per our growth algorithm is to be growing slightly ahead of that by driving market growth, which in turn will drive share and a bigger part of us leading the market. So that would be my answer. On the current fiscal year, obviously, by reiterating guidance of 4% to 5% and being right in the middle of that range fiscal year-to-date. That means mathematically we expect quarter four to be in the 4% to 5% range. And if you project that out, I think with the market growth dynamic I was describing, I think that will give you a good starting point for next fiscal year. We did not reiterate the top end of the range, but we reiterated the range. And that means 5% is still possible. Is it probable? I don't know. Probably more 50-50 than it was before. So the range is valid. I wouldn't point today at the top end of the range. On the SG&A line, we continue to invest in marketing as we discussed in previous question, and we really saw an increase in our marketing spend of about 14% year-over-year. That's the main driver. It's offset by productivity on the SG&A line, but really I would point to continued investment, productive investments to drive market growth and push out our innovation and that's the main driver of the SG&A increase that you're seeing. Yes. Thanks, Olivia. I don't think the fundamental dynamic in terms of consumers trading into the P&G portfolio and trading up is changing. We've not observed it over the past 2 years, and we've not seen it in the most recent period. There are some drivers and headwinds to mix. The biggest headwind I would mention is SK-II being down 30%. It's our highest value per or one of the highest value per unit items, and that obviously has a material impact on mix. Outside of that, we really don't see in any of the regions a significant down trading within our portfolio. As I mentioned, in the U.S., we continue to see trade up. Actually, the premium tiers on baby care doing better. I mentioned that in the context of Love. So we continue to think that the way that we innovate, providing value with innovation and showing the superiority of our premium items in the portfolio is resonating with consumers. And as long as we do that and as long as that value is real and tangible for consumers, I think we can hold on to that mix trend that we've seen consistently. Thanks, Chris. I think you gave the answer on the organic sales line. It's exactly that. I think Argentina, as we said, peso requires a little less pricing. That's an impact on organic sales, and the business is also smaller and responding maybe more aggressively to the pricing. So that is one building block. The other building block, I think is the biggest one is really the U.S. inventory reduction. So as I think about the step up that we need to see in order to be within that 4% to 5% range, we assume that that inventory reduction is a one timer, and that's what we expect in the guidance range. The elasticity in general is not changing. I think we've done and you see it in the results, I think the teams have done a very good job of making sure that we maintain a healthy value equation for our retail partners and our consumers with strong innovation, with pricing, only pricing where necessary, balancing pricing with strong productivity. So I do feel overall the business is responding very favorably even after we had to take the pricing that we took. The volume is coming up as we would have expected both in the market and for P&G. And in our biggest geographies, we're growing volume share consistently. So I do feel overall the elasticity is doing well. Baby is a very elastic category. And especially, as I mentioned, if we've not been able to consistently innovate across all tiers. And that actually is a confirmation of the model. So where we've not been able to push the innovation out and hold the full level of superiority as we took pricing, the consumer is responding. And we know the answer to that, which is push the innovation that we know how to do and communicate as a priority, and I'm confident that we'll recover the elasticity here. I don't see a broader issue. Actually, I see a lot of upside with the strength of the innovation pipeline going into next year. Look, I'd be worried that the phenomena you're describing would be a driver if, A, the volume in the market wasn't growing, which it is, and if we weren't able to grow volume share, but only grow value share. So I don't think that's the case. We're growing volume share. The market is growing in terms of volume. And one of the hypotheses I would have for you is that a lot of our consumers are actually not switching with private label heavily at this point in time. On the metrics that we use, look, private label share is the most visible metric that we can point to and it's also visible to you. So it's one that is convenient to use and objectively verifiable. So that's why we're using it. Internally, obviously, we use a lot more detail. We track exact consumption by tier, by product form, by retail channel. We check our share versus competitive share at that level of detail. So there's a lot more internal discussion on do we see trade down within our portfolio, do we see trade down across our portfolio with competitors to lower tiers. But private label is just the most visible and robust measure that we can point to that is visible to you guys. Yes. Hi, Filippo. You're right. We hope U.S. market growth continues in the high 4s, low 5s, and I think the trend line is pointing in that direction. And unless we see any major inventory reduction, I would expect us to continue to trend in that same direction. We are driving market growth in most of our categories in the U.S., and that should mathematically then result in stable to increasing shares both on the volume and value side. And that's certainly the objective the team has on all the U.S. businesses. The laundry recall, it was a very limited recall on a packaging defect on 1 SKU on Tight PODS. Out of an abundance of caution, the team decided to recall the product. It's no impact or very limited impact actually on the quarter or the fiscal year. And again, that product itself is safe, so no issue with the product. It was a small packaging defect, but in any case, the team decided to go ahead and recall. We're very excited about the EVO innovation. The fiber spinning innovation has been one of our core developments, so seeing it in market is exciting, but it's very early. So we run these test markets to validate product market fit, validate the commercial execution, validate everything from packaging color to packaging sizes. And it'll take us a few months before we have anything of substance. But yes, the innovation is very exciting, but it will take time before it has an impact on overall laundry growth in the U.S. Indeed, Europe results have been outstanding. Aggregate Europe between Europe focused markets and Europe enterprise markets, we now have, I think, 12 consecutive quarters of 5% or higher growth, which is outstanding. I think the strength of the business maybe let me focus on the focus markets here for a minute. The strength of the business has been consistent because of the execution of the team, strong innovation pushed out over an extended period of time as we were taking pricing, very strong productivity work in the region across every part of the P&L to limit the amount of pricing we needed to take but brilliant execution of the pricing that was taken, respecting key price points, respecting retailers and consumer constraints, and I think that's playing out. We've also invested very strongly probably more than ever in terms of marketing support of those innovations in the focus markets. And we are building the same digital capability in terms of consumer targeting to become more effective and efficient with our spend in Europe that we've used in the U.S. for an extended period of time. So all of those would be contributors to growth. On the enterprise market side, I would caution it's not without headwinds. Russia continues to be a headwind that we called out with a reduced portfolio and very little support of the business. We have work to do in Turkey as Turkey recovers from the heavy inflation based pricing and some of the Middle East outflow of tensions. So it's not without headwinds, but I think the underlying performance of the European business continues to be strong, and it's built the right way. You're correct on the channel shifting in China. Obviously, Douyin is a significant driver, most heavily probably in beauty. We've been talking about this before. What we want to make sure is we keep a healthy balance between building brand equity versus simply low funnel transactional execution via KOLs that only make sales via deep discounting, but don't do anything for the brand equity or for our superiority messaging. That's what we're doing. We're building brand houses on Douyin. We're making sure that we have a good balance between transactional communication and equity communication. We have innovation that is launching on Douyin First, Head and Shoulders Premium would be a good example of most recent innovations. So we're playing in the channel, but we're playing with a sense of value creation and balance between top-line growth and profitability. The channel is relevant for other parts of the business as well and the same principles apply. We are careful to ensure that we are balanced across top line and bottom-line, and we protect and grow underlying brand equity. Okay. Good morning, Peter. Yes, the foreign exchange held was an interesting one because the $400 million reduction, as we said, was all related to Argentina. And we had assumed in the previous guidance that whatever exposure is generated in Argentina will have to be offset with pricing within the fiscal year in Argentina. So as the assumption changes and the business size reduces, the net outcome to the P&L is very limited. So yes, we saw a technical reduction because of the improving peso and the lower size or smaller size of the business. The net effect to the P&L will be very limited because of the underlying assumption we made from the very beginning that we would offset that impact of FX via pricing in the market. SK-II in China is, I think bottoming out in terms of the shipment pattern. As we said, we are about 30% down in the quarter. It's very encouraging to see some positive signs in terms of consumer sentiment as the team continues to innovate. The team drives very strong communication on the core benefit space of the SK-II proposition focusing on PITERA as a core ingredient and reason to believe. We are leveraging continue to leveraging the core consumer in China, very loyal to the brand, to amplify that messaging and it's starting to resonate. So we see positive signs. It will take time until that translates into shipments though. I think retailers are sitting on a little bit of stock, and I think they will be hesitant to order until they see good signs of consumption increases. So I would caution, I don't expect this to be a fast recovery. This will take some time. Maybe last point on SK-II. Outside of China, the business is doing very well. We're growing double digits in Japan, so I think the fundamental proposition is healthy. We just have to sort through this period in China. And again, we're pointing, I think, in the right direction, but it will take time. Destocking in the U.S. was broadly personal healthcare related. That was the biggest effect in, again, an okay season, but significantly weaker than last year and generally an industry wide recovery of the supply chain. So if you're a retailer, you no longer see the need to hold safety stock. You're convinced that when the season restarts and you need product, you can order and you get it. There was some of that also in the Tampax business, in the tampon business, as we have stabilized the supply chain there, similar dynamic. And there was a little bit of destocking in Hair Care, because we had up stocking in the base, but the majority of it, to keep it simple, is healthcare. Indeed, the EVO technology, so the fiber spinning technology, is a technology that can be applied in broader context. We've applied it to facial cleaning in beauty, and there are many other applications. This is one of our platform technologies, if you think about it. The ability to spin chemistry into a fiber and avoid water as a carrying agent has so many efficiencies and advantages in the chemistry that we can put together and obviously in the logistics and cost side that, yes, we would want to apply it. But step by step, we got to make sure the EVO's proposition works well, and that's why we're in test market, and we talked about this earlier. Competitive spending, if done the right way, would be a good thing. If we see competitors innovate, if we see competitors communicate in market constructive ways, drive incremental spend in marketing dollars, that's a good thing. So we hope to see that. On the promotion side, we don't really see a dynamic that would point to anyone escalating promotion. We see stable depth of promotion in Europe, a little bit of increase in frequency. In the U.S., we are operating at about 85% business sold on deal, which 85 index versus pre-COVID level, sorry, that's about 29% of business volume sold on deal. And we see competitors at similar ranges, so and it's stable over a period of time. So again, if we see market constructive spend, great. Nobody seems to have an interest in heavy promotion at this point in time. Yes. Kaumil, the main driver here is the profile of some of the tailwinds and headwinds. I don't expect a major step up in spend quarter over quarter. I think we will sustain good investment levels. And again, as I said, we will be ROI driven, so it's up to the teams. But I don't expect a step up as the main explanation of why Q4 looks different in terms of EPS growth. The main driver is a lot of the commodity help has been booked in the front half of the year. And if anything, there's a little commodity herd coming in Q4. As we talked, oil potentially as reflected in diesel rates and maybe some of the pulp impact will hit this fiscal year. And then the foreign exchange rate, so forget about Argentina. I think we've discussed that. But the balance of the foreign exchange rate will mostly hit in the second half, and that's heavily in quarter four. And then the last element is just base period. So Q4 last year was very strong because of a different profile. This profile looks a little bit different for the reasons I explained. But don't expect a material change in spend behavior. It's really more of the macro drivers that impact the profile. Yes. Mark, on SK-II, I think the brand sentiment has been sequentially improving. The work the team is doing on innovation, on communication and credentialing, I think, is resonating with the consumer. And as the overall sentiment towards Japanese brands is improving, we are also getting a bit more bold in the breadth of the communication, the reach and frequency that we use. So I think all of that is pointing in the right direction. As I mentioned, I think the order behavior might lag, so we might see improvement in consumption before we see improvement in shipment. So that's why I was cautioning that while we see consumer sentiment improving, that first has to translate in increased consumption, and that then has to translate into increased orders and shipment, and that will take some time. So the team is doing the right work, and I'm glad they're actually doing it in a very balanced way to ensure that we're rebuilding this brand for the long-term. In terms of spending, I think this will really be done business by business, geography by geography, so it's hard to give you an answer. The only thing I'd point to is we are planning on significant productivity to continue in the marketing spend area. So that in and of itself would be somewhere between $400 million and $500 million of productivity in the space. That is always up for discussion. Do you reinvest or do you flow it through. And it will really depend on the level of innovation we are able to drive. More innovation means more spend and hopefully better return. And I'll leave it at that in terms of the ROI. I think I've answered the question before. It's there in the aggregate discipline of the categories, but I wouldn't want to go into more detail. I think it's really down to the category country combinations at which we measure it, and at which those decisions are made. Look, I think if more of our competitors adopt a market constructive strategy and innovate and spend in that way, that's good for everyone. And if you look at the category development globally, there's still so much opportunity to grow even in the most developed markets to grow category penetration in places like fabric enhancers. So that is a big opportunity in many of the markets where we play. The category development index is index 30 or maybe slightly higher. So there's plenty of opportunity to be market constructive, so that's a good thing. We are constantly looking at our superiority and our innovation. That's inherent in the strategy of irresistible superiority. So we've talked about resetting the bar. We've done that with exactly that in mind, what will it take for us to continue to be market constructive, win consumers for the next 5 years instead of just looking back at the success we had over the past 5 years. So that is part of the growth model and part of how the organization operates. All right. Thank you for your time today. If you have additional questions, John, myself will be available during the day. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jon Chevalier, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for the October to December quarter, Jon will add perspective on our recent results and strategic focus areas and capabilities. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '24, and then take your questions. October to December, was another strong quarter. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market-share results and another quarter of strong margin progress, delivering strong earnings and cash results for the quarter. The strong results we've delivered in the first half of fiscal '24, enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners. We continue to see the upper range on organic sales and core EPS as likely outcome for fiscal '23 - '24. So, moving to second quarter numbers, organic sales grew 4%, volume rounded down to a decline of one point as continued volume acceleration in North America and Europe focused markets was offset by softer shipments in Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East, Africa regions due to local issues in select markets. Pricing contributed four points to sales growth, consistent with the guidance we provided, mix was neutral to organic sales growth. Growth across categories continues to be broad based with eight of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales this quarter. Home care, hair care and grooming grew sales high single digits. Fabric care, family care, feminine care and oral care were up mid-single digits. Baby care was in line with prior year. Personal health care was down low singles against a very tough comp and a late developing cold and flu season this year. Skin and personal care was down mid singles due to SK-II in China. Growth was also broad based across geographies with North America, Europe, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets each growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter and enterprise markets grew 7%. Organic sales in North America grew 5% with four points of volume growth. Over the last five quarters, volume growth in North America has been minus three, flat, then 2% growth plus 3% and now plus 4%, strong acceleration well ahead of the underlying market trends. Europe focused markets were up 7% with three points of volume growth. As expected, both regions saw a step down in pricing contribution to sales growth as a large portion of price increases from last year have annualized. Importantly, volume accelerated in both regions to partially offset the pricing impact. Latin America delivered another very strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth, continued strong results in these regions. There are some targeted issues affecting other markets. Greater China organic sales were down minus 15% versus prior year. Underlying market growth was down mid to high single digits as consumer confidence weakened further. The SK-II brand in Greater China was down 34% due to soft market conditions and a temporary headwind for Japanese brands in the market. Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half. Underlying market trends have softened in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, following multiple rounds of pricing to offset inflation and due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 20 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 50 basis points reflecting strong volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 90 basis points over the past three months. In summary, North America, Europe focus Markets, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America, which combined represent three-quarters of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in quarter two, with three points of volume growth and three points of price mix. These same markets grew 9% in quarter one with around two points of volume growth and seven points of price mix. Continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing, consistent with our guidance. The balanced 25% of company sales including Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa were impacted by local market issues we described. Quarter two organic sales for this group were down five points versus prior year. We expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing, SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve, and over time return to mid singles, and we expect market pressures in the Middle east and Turkey to ease over time. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.84, up 16% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core operating margin increased 400 basis points as 520 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation and foreign exchange impacts in SG&A. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 470 basis points. Productivity improvements were a very strong 340 basis points helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall progress in the first half of the year keeping us on track for our fiscal year guidance ranges. Now I'll pass it over to Jon for his perspective.\nJon Moeller: Thanks Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by underscoring a few points Andre made in his discussion of the topline trends. Overall, continued strong top line progress 22nd consecutive quarter of 4% or better organic sales growth, volume acceleration in key markets, increases in aggregate market shares. This despite several notable headwinds, which should be temporary. Tensions in the Middle East will hopefully ease. Enterprise market volume impacts following price increases are usually temporary. While we can't talk specifics of future pricing in any market, more stable foreign exchange and commodity costs will ideally reduce the need for additional large price increases. I spent six days in China with the team two weeks ago. I met with consumers in their homes, with retail CEOs with our team, and with several government officials. In my view, the long-term China opportunity remains intact. The near term is likely to present some challenges. We'll see what happens with the global cough cold season as a soft start to the season either reverses or eventually annualizes. No guarantee of immediate bounce back in any of these, but reason to believe they will improve over time. In addition to continued aggregate topline progress, a very strong bottom line, mid-teens core earnings per share growth two quarters in a row, while increasing investments in innovation, brand building and market growth. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past five years, pre COVID, during COVID and through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle. I want to thank them both for what they delivered and for what they're working to continue to accomplish. Our integrated strategy is unchanged. A focused portfolio of products and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies for several years. The announcements we made in December to change our go to market approach in Argentina and Nigeria will further sharpen our focus and strengthen our value creation potential. A good example of the dynamic nature of our strategy and our desire to aggressively allocate resources to where they create the most shareholder value. Next strategy element, ongoing commitment to an investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than at any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands, priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. Smooth tear Charmin Ultra Soft Smooth with scalloped edge perforations, a great example of consumer insights driving innovation to improve the in-use experience. Consumer response to the new product has been overwhelmingly positive and is driving word of mouth recommendations in social media. Gillette's superior propositions like the GilletteLabs razor with an exfoliating bar that removes dirt and debris before the blades, continue to drive growth in the global grooming category. GilletteLabs has reached shares greater than 20% in markets like Spain and France, and is building momentum in the U.S. and China. The global grooming category is on track for $1 billion of retail sales growth this fiscal year, with Gillette driving two-thirds of the increase, well ahead of our global share. Superior innovations like Dawn Power Wash and Dawn EZ-Squeeze in the U.S. and Fairy power spray and Fairy Max in Europe are disproportionately driving market growth in hand dishwashing with value share in the U.S. approaching 67%, merely 50% across Europe focused markets. Third strategy element productivity, improvement in all of our operations to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth, to mitigate cost and currency challenges, and to expand margins and generate cash. We're reaccelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings and cost of goods of up to $1.5 billion before tax. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chain 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain, end to end, versus simply trying to optimize each piece. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using AI tools to optimize fill rates and for dynamic routing and sourcing optimization, $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. The team has delivered strong cost savings in the first half of the year, and plans to build on this momentum. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity, using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continue to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization model. Also, an increasingly diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. So strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas we've outlined previously. Supply chain 3.0 is delivering productivity as we just talked. We're also driving improved capacity planning, greater supply agility, flexibility, data transparency, scale and resilience, all the way up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this was driving higher quality, increased supply assurance and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys. Environmental sustainability - superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are sustainable, driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. A good example is the four chamber Ariel platinum PODS innovation that we launched in a new cardboard package. Extending our superiority advantage in product performance while improving sustainability by enabling great wash results even in cold water, already contributing to a two-degree celsius reduction in wash temperatures in Europe against a five-degree target. Also extending packaging superiority with a more attractive and more sustainable cardboard box. Digital acumen - leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value. Fourth - the superior value equation for all employees, inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent, and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not new and separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe that there is merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth, and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. Now back to Andre for guidance.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks Jon. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong first half results enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. This outlook includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that we began to see in our second quarter results as the market lapsed the last waves of cost recovery pricing. For P&G, we expect the pricing contribution to topline growth to reduce by an additional 1 to 2 points in the back half of the year. We will continue to price for new innovations when warranted and to mitigate FX impacts. On the bottom line enabled by very strong earnings growth in the first half of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal '24 core earnings per share from a range of 6% to 9% to a range of 8% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. This guidance implies slower bottom-line growth in the second half. As we highlighted last quarter, the second half of the fiscal year will see less pricing benefit as we annualize more prior year increases. We will also see less commodity cost benefit in the second half. Wage and benefit inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our direct costs, and FX headwinds will increase versus the first half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we continue to expect organic sales and core EPS growth toward the upper end of the renewed guidance ranges. We estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to expect foreign exchange will be a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax for the fiscal year. The vast majority of this impact is driven by Argentina, and is heavily skewed towards the back half of the year. This outlook is based on a forecast for continued significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso, which we expect to largely offset with appropriate price increases. We now expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs weakness are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain superior value for consumers and retailers. Now, I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts.\nJon Moeller: We continue to be very pleased with the strong results P&G people are delivering in a challenging operating and competitive environment. Continued excellent execution of an integrated market constructive strategy. I want to thank each of them for that. While we expect volatile consumer and macrodynamics to continue, we remain confident that the best path forward is to double down on the strategy that has enabled strong results and remain committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for shareholders. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning, guys. So just wanted to focus on the back half. Clearly the 4% Q2 core sales growth result wasn't as strong as the 7% Q1 delivery, which is very robust result. So obviously some quarterly volatility here. Can you just give us some perspective for the fiscal back half relative to Q2 in light of that first half volatility as you think through some of the key geographies and volume versus price mix, and some of the temporary impacts Jon mentioned? And then just same question on EPS basically, obviously very strong first half that continued in Q2, full year guidance implies a more muted second half. So, is there some conservatism baked in there? Help us understand that. I know Andre touched on it, but maybe give us a bit more detail there on the back half from an earnings perspective. Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, morning Dara, let me start and Jon will add. On the top line, if you look at the first half, we are right in line with what we're projecting for the year, an average of 5%, and we obviously then expect about 5% for the back half. We see volatility, as you had pointed out in some geographies that we mentioned in the script. I think the core point though is the core geography, 75% of the sales are performing very well. We continue to see acceleration in volume growth in North America with 4% volume growth, 5% sales growth. Europe is very strong. Latin America very strong. We continue to see volume acceleration in most places. So that gives us confidence that that projects well for the second half of the year. We also expect some of the volatility that we experienced in quarter two to disappear or at least improve in the second half. The SK-II sentiment is improving based on our consumer research in China, and we are continuing to drive innovation, equity investment and really relying on our most loyal and passionate user base to help amplify that messaging, which is working well. So, we expect the effects to improve year-over-year - quarter over quarter. From an enterprise market standpoint, we also view the pricing impacts that are impacting some of the markets like Turkey to disappear over time, as pricing in the market is established, competitive pricing catches up and then the impact of the tensions in the Middle East certainly hopefully will improve as well. So very strong continued performance on the core markets, which are 75% of the sales, and we expect somewhat improving trends and stabilization in the other 25%. On the EPS side, very strong performance in the front half, 17% in quarter one, 16% in quarter two, sets us up well for the upper end of their guidance range, which is reflected in the tightening of their guidance. However, to keep in mind, we see a reversal of a number of effects that have supported the half one results. We saw the majority of the commodity help flow through in the first half, and this is part of the improvement in quarter two EPS. We see the flow through happening faster than we would have anticipated in some instances, so that leaves less of a contribution for the second half. We also have the majority of the foreign exchange hurt in the second half, about 75% of FX hurt of the billion dollars will hit the second half. As we indicated, the majority of that is Argentina, so we will try to offset via appropriate pricing. Nevertheless, the growth impact is tilted towards the back half. Price mix contribution will ease. We saw still significant contribution in the first half, that will lower by 1 point to 2 points in the back half, which also has an impact on EPS growth. And lastly, we continue to see wage inflation in our own operation as well as in our supply chain flowing through. Now, that being said, if everything goes well, could there be upside? Sure. But we believe that guidance is appropriately reflecting the potential variability here. So those are the core drivers. Jon, any perspective?\nJon Moeller: I have nothing to add on Andre's bottom line perspective. I would just reiterate one thing and add one thing on the top line. There are two questions that we've been discussing as we've gone through the first half of the year. The first relates to our ability to reaccelerate volume, which we've talked about several times in this conversation this morning. And I just want to reiterate how encouraging that progress has been. We've said it before, but it's worth saying again in our largest market, North America, past five quarters, minus 30, plus two, plus three, plus four. Europe, which tends to be fairly price sensitive, volumes, plus three. So that gives us confidence in terms of the momentum of the business on a forward basis. The other thing I would just call out that adds to this discussion is the breadth of the top line progress that the team has been making. Eight out of 10 categories held or grew sales in the quarter that we just completed, 21 of our top 25 brands did the same. And if you look at our top 12 brands, nine of those are growing at high singles or better rates. And that's inclusive of all the challenges that we're managing around the world. So that gives us confidence that the top line growth that we've been delivering should continue, just as Andre said, and that should provide the ability to continue to deliver decent levels of bottom-line growth as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I want a clarification, Andre, to your answer to Dara's question. And then I have a question. So, the clarification, I think when you responded regarding organic sales growth for the back half and tacking to the year, the 5%, is it that Procter is tracking to 5% organic sales for the year? Or were you saying an expectation for 5% organic sales growth for the back half? I wasn't quite sure if you were talking full year or specifically about the back half.\nAndre Schulten: Hi, Bryan. No, what I was talking was the full year expectation. So again, we reiterate the range of four to five, but we see the possibility and strong probability that we'll be able to deliver towards the upper end of that range for the fiscal year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. So, with the very sizable gross margin delivery this quarter and the outlook for the full year, there's a ton of reinvestment going back into P&L, right. And this quarter you called out the specifics, but I think know that's pretty well implied for the second half as well. So, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about incremental areas of reinvestment because the basis points are big and the dollars are even bigger. And so, I don't know, like, it might sound ridiculous, but it gets to a point where you start to worry externally, is there an excessive amount of reinvestment? So, I'd love it, Jon, if you could talk through your perspective on that, on making sure there's not money effectively being spent less efficiently in the P&L simply because you have that much flexibility. Thanks.\nJon Moeller: Are you saying, Lauren, that you want 30% core rates for share growth? Just kidding.\nLauren Lieberman: Well, that's kind of what I'm getting at, right? Yes.\nJon Moeller: All right, I'll speak first on this, and I'm sure Andre has some perspective as well. But if you look at the amount of innovation that's coming to market, both currently and in the future, and if you look at the opportunity to fully penetrate households with that innovation in ways that delights them and improves their lives, now is not the time to be pulling back on investments in marketing or commercialization efforts of that innovation. And that's where the majority of the incremental spend has come from and will come from, we look very carefully. I don't want to ignore your question on the effectiveness of that spend and continue to see through the addition of many tools and data sets that we can increase the effectiveness of that advertising, increase the return rates of that advertising as you see in our bottom line, while increasing reach. So that's what we'll be focusing on. We'll be very disciplined in that effort. Neither Andre or I or the rest of the team has any desire to spend money that isn't working for us.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. And maybe just to add, we just talked with our team actually about being very granular about the assessment of the ROI. So, we don't have good investments, cover for bad investments. So really go down to the country level, to the brand level, to the channel level when we assess whether we are getting a payout on the investments. But the majority of the spend, as Jon said, is really focused on driving market growth. When you think about the opportunity on FE, for example, we've created 100% of the market growth in North America on FE, and it's still the biggest opportunity the team has in order to continue to accelerate both our own growth in a constructive way and the market given the low penetration FE has - Fabric Enhancers. Oran-B, another example, a power Oral-B was launched - Oral-B iO10 and we're also expanding distribution of Oral-B iO3, 4 and 5. We've led 70% of global market growth with those launches. So, communicating the benefit and driving penetration is a huge opportunity. So be assured we look at ROI very carefully. And again, market growth continues to be the main area of focus when we invest incrementally.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRob Ottenstein: Terrific. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on the state of the consumer in your two most important markets, the U.S. and China, how consumer demand developed through the quarter and into January? And when you talk about China, if you could also touch upon travel retail and maybe what SK-II was on a greater China basis, including travel retail as well. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: I'll start. Morning Robert. Look, the US continues to be very solid, continues to impress with I think a very smooth transition from pricing, annualizing and overall consumption coming up in terms of volume, which is enabling us to post the volume improvements Jon was quoting over the past few quarters, and still accelerating ahead of market with 4% volume growth and 50 basis points of market share growth. We continue to see trade up within our propositions. So as consumers come in, maybe at a lower tier and a lower value proposition, they continue to trade up in the U.S., which speaks to the health of the proposition but also the health of the consumer and willingness to invest. The last data point I'll give you on the U.S. is we are able to grow as private label shares are slightly up, we are up the same range. So, some consumers will look for value in private label, but an equal if not higher amount of consumers find better value in our propositions as we drive continued superiority via innovation. So, feel very strongly about the U.S., we'll continue to invest to drive more market growth there, but the consumer is resilient and the business is doing well. On China, I'll begin. I'm sure Jon has incremental perspective, but the China opportunity remains intact. If you look at the underlying market size, if you look at the potential development of the middle class, if you look at the ability to drive category penetration in our categories, all of those are huge opportunities for us, and all of those point to continued investment and commitment to the Chinese market. We have a very capable organization, and we continue to be very optimistic that we can create value. Honestly, when the market requires market growth to be driven by manufacturers, I think that positions us very well with our retail partners in China to have a competitive advantage and execute the model that we know how to execute in many parts of the world. In the short term, we mentioned it in the script, consumer sentiment is not fully recovered yet, and that is reflected in the results. Again, if you want to take a silver lining, we see the attractiveness of key opinion leaders and heavy discounting in key consumption periods decreasing. And that's actually good for us. And we believe that a focus on brand equity, a focus on strong everyday value via the priority, will allow us to help grow the market back to mid-single digits and strengthen our position in the market. Last point on SK-II, no specifics. The numbers we're quoting, obviously on the quarter, minus 34% include the domestic travel retail channel. Nothing else to add there other than we remain confident that as the sentiment improves, which we see already, with continued investment in SK-II, we see that business recovering over the back half.\nJon Moeller: Robert, as Andre suggested, I'll just provide a little bit of additional color on China. Having spent a fair amount of my career involved in that market and having just spent almost a full week there, in digesting the Q2 numbers, the P&G numbers in China, you have to think about a couple things. One is SK-II, which, just for clarity for everybody, is really driven by an anti-Japanese brand sentiment which Andre described. Our opening remarks that's related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear facility, and we've had not identical but similar consumer sentiment dynamics in the past as relates to this brand and as relates to the relationship between those two countries. And it has always resolved itself with SK-II moving to higher heights. So, if you look at the decline in China on the quarter, on our business, I don't know the exact number, but basically think of it as 50% of that being the dynamic I just described and 50% of it being the market dynamics. The second thing that Andre referred to is important to understand as well. The heaviest purchase period historically in China was in November. I'm talking years past. And that was always a little bit disconcerting for us because a disproportionate amount of product moved during Double Eleven. It filled consumer pantries. It filled some retailer pantries, inventories and warehouses. It often moved at heavily discounted prices. The amount of movement during that period this year was much lower. And as Andre said, we view that as a good thing. And it's a temporary impact, a quarterly impact, a Q2 impact on the indices, but it moves us into a healthier position. If you think about the medium to longer term, Andre mentioned the expected addition of 200 million middle income consumers to China's population, that's very encouraging. Also, I mentioned I was in homes, I was in stores, I was with our retail partners. They remain encouraged about the future of China. I was talking to our organization at the end of the trip, our organization in China, and I told them I had never seen as much alignment in the market between our intentions and our strategy, our retailers intention and their strategy and the government's intention and their strategy, all focused on what's being referred to as quality market growth. As Andre suggested, that's a very good thing for us. We can play very effectively and help with that agenda, help society on a parallel path. And so, you put all that together, and I agree with Andre, and I said it earlier, I think the growth potential here remains intact. There are some specific items that exacerbate the trend that you're seeing on the quarter, but I expect this will continue to be a source of both growth and value creation for P&G. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Thanks, and good morning. At the risk of provoking another long answer, I guess what struck me this morning is just the confidence and front footedness, if that's a word, in both of your comments this morning, and I think, Jon, your strategic perspective struck me as particularly assertive. I say that in the context on the outside, I think faced with some of the market challenges, you've called out China, the Middle east, etc., this quarter, concerns grow that P&G is likely to be thrown off course or maybe getting complacent. And I guess my question is, why is that wrong? And what to you are the keys to keeping the organization's eye on the ball, focused, grounded and executing on all those strategic pillars that you went through.\nJon Moeller: Thanks, Steve. I want to step back first. We do face a lot of challenges in the world that we all live in, and those have impacted our business. But stepping back probably five years, the level of challenge has always existed, whether it was COVID, whether it was the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, whether it was the 50% reduction, 50 in our profit over two years as a result of commodities, foreign exchange, and transportation costs, and this organization overcame all of that. They've overcome the challenges we faced in the last quarter, and that gives me a huge amount of confidence that we have the ability, the skills, the strategy and the agility to continue to meet challenges, face first, and work through them in ways that are constructive for consumers, for customers, for employees, for society, and for share owners. We talk a lot internally about the complacency and the evils associated with it. So, it's front and center in our thought process. I have a couple of kind of trite sayings that I use in communicating with the organization, and one of them is that complacency kills. You don't see a complacent organization when you're looking at the breadth of growth that they're delivering. When you're looking at the continued, after a decade, continued work on productivity, yielding the kind of margin progress that we saw this quarter, you don't see it as they reinvest that into growing markets and to growing household penetration and shares. We're not immune to it, so you're right to raise it. But I feel, as you said, I feel the organization, not just myself, are very much on their front foot as they move to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. I've frankly never seen as many opportunities. Now, there's a lot of work associated with capitalizing on those opportunities, and there will be lots of challenges and forces that will be working against us in that endeavor. But the accomplishments of the midterm past, the most recent past, the reflection of the work that the organization is doing all the way down the income statement and the innovation progress that I'm seeing not only in market or coming to market, but as we review the pipelines across each of the categories also give me a good degree of confidence.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning, everyone. Jon, I wanted to go back to China. You mentioned clearly that there was an impact from the cycling of the eleven-eleven shipments. And can you give us some sense, like how down was China and SK-II during that period, and maybe some of the axial rate coming out of December that gives you some confidence in the improvement in the country in the second half. Thank you.\nJon Moeller: I apologize. I honestly don't operate at that level of data aggregation. So, I don't have the answer with any degree of specificity, but I know the impact was there. I know it's a good thing for us long term, and apologize, but I'm just going to leave it there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. The U.S. volume growth improvement is very constructive. It's quite a bit better than what we can see in the U.S. Nielsen data, for example. I know the data is far from perfect, but I wonder if you could just help characterize whether you have any non-track channel boosts or in general talk about some of the specifics of what has really driven this volume improvement over the past five quarters. And I think maybe just connected to that if you could. There's a lot of debate right now across consumer staples around just what does drive volume improvement, whether that's promotional activity or increased advertising or just the lapping of pricing. And I find it interesting today that this dynamic of sequential volume growth, and I wonder if you can just maybe talk about in general why this seems to be happening, what you're doing to drive this, or whether this is just the natural evolution of markets post substantial pricing. So, thanks so much for that.\nAndre Schulten: Yes. Hi Chris, let me start. On the non-covered channel side, we've seen non-covered outpace cover channels for a period of time. This is not different. There's nothing specific happening there. We see a trend of some consumers going into larger pack sizes. Those are in club, those are online, and many of those effects continue. But there's nothing differential between covered and non-covered channels. Both are performing well. Non-covered a little bit ahead of covered, so that's why you don't see the results in the track data. What's driving the growth? I would argue it's all of the above that you've mentioned, right. I think, we're seeing pricing lapping, consumers seeing the pricing normalizing on the shelf. We don't see an increase in promotion depth or frequency, quite frankly. We are still operating at about 85% of pre-COVID levels from a volume sold on deal perspective. Competition is in a similar range, so there's no escalation of promotion. But what drives it, is strong innovation, innovation that is focused on growing the market, and strong communication of that innovation in a very targeted way, leveraging our capability, to be very detailed and very intentional on who we talk to, at what point in time, with what messaging. The U.S. is probably our most sophisticated market in that regard, and it shows in the ROIs and in the results - back to Lauren's question earlier. A few examples. Just the Gillette business, innovation on the core with the Labs razor provides a growth driver. But adding new jobs to be done, like female facial hair removal or male and female body hair removal, incremental jobs that when communicated appropriately of the benefit of the product drive incremental consumption. I mentioned Oral-B, penetration still low on the electric toothbrush. And as we're converting more and more users, that drives incremental growth with more innovation, but also expansion of the lower-priced options of Oral-B i03, 4, and 5, and then the launch of Oral-B 10. Last example, I'll give you and then I'll let Jon add is Olay Super Serum. Just to cover a few of the categories here is a new serum. The most successful new serum in the category, 30% of those users are new to the category. So again, communication, strong innovation, premium propositions, and bringing new crews to the categories, is what's driving that accelerated volume growth.\nJon Moeller: And I'll just pile on. I agree with everything that Andre said. So just a couple more examples to show you again the breadth of the innovation that's been commercialized currently. He talked about Olay very exciting innovation in our hair care business as well. An example, Head & Shoulders BARE, which is a more efficacious anti-dandruff offering with the Bare minimum number of ingredients, nine to be exact. In an eco-friendly package, 45% less plastic. And it's one of the drivers of growth, particularly in North America on the Head & Shoulders brand which is up 8% fiscal year-to-date. Another example in a different category, Swiffer PowerMop, which is driving that business up 11% fiscal year-to-date and has built both volume and value of share at about 1.5 level so that's... And back to Steve's question on complacency, this is what we need to keep doing and that's why we talk about the best path forward being doubling down on exactly these things. They do drive market, they do drive volume, they do drive sales and they do it profitably.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to that 4% volume growth commentary in the U.S. and 3% in the EU focus markets. And despite the tough comparison for the cold and flu season, it seems that you had market share gains in laundry and some other key categories. So can you comment on how you exited the quarter, for the cold and flu season in the U.S. and in Europe? And separately, have you - it seems that you secured more distribution in the balance of this fiscal year. So any comment on that? And a clarification on China, you said that you're confident that the growth will resume to the mid-single-digit level. I'm assuming that's not a comment for this fiscal year. But as you commented out, Jon, in terms of like the Head & Shoulder and I know hair care is a big category there and you're comping easy comps in hair. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more than SK-II in particular? Thank you.\nJon Moeller: Let me just take China real quick and then turn it over to Andre. On the cough, cold trend, et cetera. The mid-single-digit number that we referred to, is an expectation of longer-term market growth. You're correct. It is not an expectation of ours for either the market or our business in this current fiscal year. On the broader beauty question, when you take SK-II and the market impacts in China out of the equation. You see a business that's performing extraordinarily well. I mentioned Head & Shoulders, which is the largest shampoo brand in the world up 8% fiscal year-to-date. If you look at North America, Pantene fiscal year-to-date up 15%. Our skin and personal care business up double-digits. The same is true for the beauty business in Enterprise LA and in Europe. So it's a very strong business benefiting from the exact same strategies obviously applied differently that we're executing across the balance of the company. And that will, over time, as the market corrects itself, be demonstrated in China as well.\nAndre Schulten: So on the other two questions on PHC, Andrea look the business is obviously very, very strong past for your average growth rate of 13%. So, the underlying strength of the business is very healthy. We see an impact of the core cost season. The season is still above average, but it's below a record season last year and it's developing a little bit slower in the current profile, which means there could be some upside coming - as time goes by. Last year Vicks was 28% in the same quarter, so you can see the high base that we mentioned in the prepared remarks.\nJon Moeller: Just one thing on that, sorry to interrupt, Andre - that I think is relatively straightforward, but it's worth mentioning. As we were all coming out of COVID going through our first cough our - first non-COVID or like COVID, cough cold season, it's not surprising having, but spent time in our homes for the last two to three years that the level of immunity was not high and therefore the level of incidence was very high. So that's what we're annualizing against combined with a slower start to the normal season. As Andre says, we'll wait to see how that all materializes. We have seen some increase in incidence. You can probably hear a little bit of a frog in my voice this morning and I heard one in Andre's.\nAndre Schulten: Right, we're contributing. There we go. Just last point on PHC, if you look at the share development in every treatment area that we cover in PHC, we're up in share. In every treatment area, we're up in organic sales across regions. So again, it's purely a seasonal element. On distribution, Andrea, I won't give you an answer other than obviously driving innovation, driving incremental sales for our retail partners, driving category growth helps with their desire to have our brands present on their shelves.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So, I know you maintained your commodity outlook this morning, but just given the first half performance, the outlook does not embed as much of a tailwind from here, which you alluded to Andre, but can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing across your key cost buckets? Where are things getting better? Where are things getting worse? And maybe just based on current spot rates, how should we think about the phasing? Would you expect deflation in both 3Q and 4Q, or is there any potential for cost to become a headwind as we exit the year? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Hi, Peter. The commodity basket is wide, complex, and changing very quickly. So the best guess we have is what we told you, $800 million of tailwind for the year, which the majority of which has been flown through the P&L in the front half. What I'll leave you with, I don't expect any headwind from commodity in the second half. It continues to be a tailwind. The second thought I'll leave you with, is the impact on the P&L given the time it takes for commodity changes to flow through our contract structures and our own variance holding policy, make the time lag significant. So, even if we saw significant volatility on commodity spot prices, the impact on the fiscal will decrease over time simply, because of those two dynamics. But continue to expect tailwinds just less than you saw in half one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hi, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in and yes belated Happy New Year to you all. A couple questions. We've talked a few times about the North America volume strength. I had in my notes that you're lapping some under-shipment that should have been a couple-point benefit to this quarter, yet I don't think you've mentioned it so far. So, A) am I wrong was there not a sizable benefit this quarter? And then it's encouraging to hear the confidence that you're expressing around - sort of sounds like an imminent improvement in SK-II, with words like recovery and improvement throughout the back half. With the decline sort of half related to Japan boycotts and half related to market conditions, where are you seeing the improvement? Is that dissipating concerns around Japanese brands, or are you actually seeing improvement in market conditions? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: So the volume - we don't see a transitory effect on the volume side Jason, good morning first of all. So the base, there is always some base volatility if you know in terms of inventories, in terms of our ability to ship, but there is no material impact that I would call out that would have to be taken into account, if you look at the U.S. volume results. So nothing there. The SK-II improvement again, I want to pace expectations, but the improvement is really in the consumer sentiment that we're seeing, where we had very high social media coverage in quarter one, leading to negative sentiment and negative top-of-mind awareness of the brand, that is now dying down and honestly most consumers have gone back, to a neutral position, open to SK-II. And so, what we're doing is really doubling down with innovation and doubling down with communication on the efficacy, the quality of the product, the quality of the brand and leveraging the most loyal and passionate consumer group to help us make the case for SK-II, which we believe will help us improve run rates in the second half. The market dynamics, we continue to see bumpy, even over the next quarters improving, but there will be volatility there.\nJon Moeller: It's just an end of one, Jason. So it's kind of irrelevant. But I was in the home of a heavy SK-II user in Beijing. And I asked her about this dynamic and how it was affected in her purchasing. And she kind of laughed, and it wasn't the normal nervous laugh. It was - and she said she followed that up with, if Japanese consumers aren't afraid of this, why should I be. And she said, I'm much more afraid of the pimple that I will get, if I don't use this than I am about. So it's starting to normalize again, that's and of one. It was also interesting to me to see, what was happening with her kind of personal inventory and just looking at the liquid fill levels in the bottles, which were low. So I think, there's a dynamic as well, where a number of consumers just kind of waited to see how this whole thing played out, and reduce their personal stocks in the process. But again, that's probably neither here nor there, but I thought it was worth sharing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, good morning. My question guys is, about your end market restructuring, which I think in the release you described as substantial liquidation of the affected markets in places like Argentina and Nigeria. And I guess look, recognizing these are not huge markets for you today. From a profit perspective, this still feels like fairly extreme decision and clearly, a challenging macro backdrop today in those markets. But in the case of Nigeria, probably one of the highest long-term potential economic market. So my question is, Jon I know these enterprise markets for your baby, so to speak, for a number of years. Just hoping you can walk us through what I imagine must have been a difficult strategic decision.\nJon Moeller: Yes, these decisions are not taken lightly. A couple of points. One is where we're moving to an import model, which will be the case in Nigeria. We maintain an option on the future of those brands in those markets. We're just choosing to operate in a way that's - that frankly is viable. You get into some tough situations in some of these markets with currency controls with pricing controls with the ability to dividend money out of these markets. And at some point, you run into a set of conditions that just make it impossible operate. You can't get - you can't source dollars as an example, in order to purchase the ingredients and raw materials, you need to manufacture your products. And so, we've come to a decision when those situations present themselves to be pragmatic to be value creative and to flow resources to bigger opportunities that present more near-term opportunity, while in some cases, maintaining our optionality on the long-term. Andre, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nAndre Schulten: Yes, I just want to clarify, because the strategic intent really is what Jon described, right? We are moving in Nigeria to an import market, we will still be present, but it's a better way to serve the consumer and a better way for us to create value. In Argentina, we are divesting our fabric and home care business, and again, are looking to find a better go-to-market model. The language you're quoting Callum is substantial liquidation, that's an accounting term. And that accounting term, is really defining the point at which we recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss in those markets, which is part of that noncash restructuring that we talked about. So the accounting term doesn't represent the business execution. It is a technical term that once we get to that point of substantial liquidation, we will recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss.\nJon Moeller: By the way, as a prior CFO would have had no hope of explaining that to you as Andre Schulten is the current CFO just did.\nAndre Schulten: I won't comment.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning. Clearly, you've generated some impressive growth in the U.S. and Europe, so I want to bring it back to the developed markets. And you've held on very nicely the price. So I wanted to ask you about competitive response and any pushback from retailers or increase in promotion from competition, given the share gains you've made and whether you're seeing any response there? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: You want to talk competitive promotion, Andre, and then I'll talk to customers.\nAndre Schulten: Happy to. Hi, Olivia, so I started to mention this in the U.S. Our promotion level is still below pre-COVID about an 85 index competitive promotion level around 90 index. So very similar. We don't see a substantial increase in either depth or frequency in U.S. In Europe, we do see an increase in frequency, we do not see any increase in depth. Actually, both frequency and depth are still below pre-COVID levels, but frequency is increasing. So competitive environment still stable. And I think it's also driven by the fact that we are driving growth. We are driving market growth, and that contributes to the share growth, which means we can grow, but also it doesn't drive necessarily negative cycles in terms of pricing in the market.\nJon Moeller: The whole idea, just building on Andre's last point there, is to create business not take business. And that works out well for us. It works out well for the categories that we compete in and it works out well for our retail partners. And that is really the focus of the existing interchange with our retail partners. It was number one, two and three supply as we've solidified our supply chains. The conversation moves very quickly to how do we work together to grow markets. That's a win-win-win proposition, a win for them, a win for us, a win for consumers. And of course, adding a fourth win for shareowners. So that's the state of play. And I experienced that in Europe, I experienced - I was in Europe as before Christmas. As you know, I was just in China, that was the nature of the conversation there, and it's clearly the nature of the conversation here in the U.S.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China for a brief time, I guess, on this call. The last quarter, you guys had talked about a portfolio structure examination. I guess I'm curious whether there's - any update on that, or what even does that mean? And maybe specifically, any underlying changes in consumer attitude towards beauty as a category including what is perceived to be relevant by brand, or efficacy. And also sort of related to that, it just seems a bit more of a fickle category more trendy category than some of the others that you were in? And I guess I'm specifically talking in China as opposed to globally, so you could sort of parse out that, I guess, if you want. But any thoughts on maintaining a presence in a category that has more subjective sort of usage than some of your other categories on everyday usage? Thanks.\nJon Moeller: I'd offer a couple thoughts there. One, China is our second largest market, sales and profits. Beauty represents a significantly disproportionate amount of the business. So, if we weren't committed to the beauty business in China, you'd have to ask yourself a different question. Second, when we did our significant portfolio restructuring, however many years ago, that was now into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, we did the same with beauty. Exiting the most fickle to use your semantics portions of the business. We exited what I call fashion fragrances and flavors. The brands that we have remaining and the categories that we play in, there's real opportunity to drive long-term loyalty with superior performance. That's true in China, that's true outside of China. And there will always be a higher trial rate in that category than in many other categories. That's not a bad thing. It helps demonstrate the superiority of what we do offer and people come back to our brands. So now - if the question is commitment to beauty in China, the answer is yes.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yes, thanks very much. We've been accustomed to strong performance in the U.S. for a number of years, but notable to see the strong performance in Europe again, with volume and price. I guess that comes at a time when you spent your scrutiny over here on pricing levels. So can you talk more about - what's behind the strong results for Europe at present?\nAndre Schulten: Look, I think the execution of the strategy in Europe is really behind the strength of the results. The team has done a fantastic job in combining the price increases that needed to be taken to recover the commodity cost increases with very strong innovation that delights the consumer at the time when they see higher pricing materialize on the shelf. And that's really behind the benign volume impact as we took the pricing and behind the acceleration of volume growth now that pricing is established in the market. We've done that. A few examples. Jon mentioned Ariel, I mentioned Ariel as well, but Ariel parts in a more sustainable packaging launched with the price increase that we needed to take has been building organic sales by up to 20% or higher. So the results are really a combination of strong innovation, pricing and therefore, maintaining consumers coming into the franchise and trading up not different from the U.S.\nJon Moeller: We convinced ourselves for years that what mattered most in Europe was price, specifically the lower the better. And that wasn't an uninformed decision. You had the highest development of heavy discounters, for example, in Europe, which would then indicate that price is an important part of the consumer value proposition. But as Andre said, in the last number of years, we've really pushed innovation as a driver of value, not forgetting about value, but delivering it through performance. And that, combined with the executional capability of that market, which has just been phenomenal. And I want to thank them all as long as you've given me the opportunity to do that, has led to just really terrific results and I believe sustainable results. Great. Thank you for your time this morning. I know it's a little bit of a difficult quarter to unpack. There's a lot going on. The net of that, although is very positive, strong really strong earnings per share growth while increasing investments in the business, both present future maintaining top line momentum, building volume momentum and building share. As I expressed before, I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve a level of success going forward, and that's based entirely on both the strategy and the ability of our organization to deliver against that. Look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a month or so, and we'll advance the conversation at that point. We're around John Chevalier sitting across the table from me right now. He's around all day. Andre is around. They'll get angry if you call me, so call them, but have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Moeller",
            "content": "Thanks Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by underscoring a few points Andre made in his discussion of the topline trends. Overall, continued strong top line progress 22nd consecutive quarter of 4% or better organic sales growth, volume acceleration in key markets, increases in aggregate market shares. This despite several notable headwinds, which should be temporary. Tensions in the Middle East will hopefully ease. Enterprise market volume impacts following price increases are usually temporary. While we can't talk specifics of future pricing in any market, more stable foreign exchange and commodity costs will ideally reduce the need for additional large price increases. I spent six days in China with the team two weeks ago. I met with consumers in their homes, with retail CEOs with our team, and with several government officials. In my view, the long-term China opportunity remains intact. The near term is likely to present some challenges. We'll see what happens with the global cough cold season as a soft start to the season either reverses or eventually annualizes. No guarantee of immediate bounce back in any of these, but reason to believe they will improve over time. In addition to continued aggregate topline progress, a very strong bottom line, mid-teens core earnings per share growth two quarters in a row, while increasing investments in innovation, brand building and market growth. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past five years, pre COVID, during COVID and through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle. I want to thank them both for what they delivered and for what they're working to continue to accomplish. Our integrated strategy is unchanged. A focused portfolio of products and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies for several years. The announcements we made in December to change our go to market approach in Argentina and Nigeria will further sharpen our focus and strengthen our value creation potential. A good example of the dynamic nature of our strategy and our desire to aggressively allocate resources to where they create the most shareholder value. Next strategy element, ongoing commitment to an investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than at any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands, priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. Smooth tear Charmin Ultra Soft Smooth with scalloped edge perforations, a great example of consumer insights driving innovation to improve the in-use experience. Consumer response to the new product has been overwhelmingly positive and is driving word of mouth recommendations in social media. Gillette's superior propositions like the GilletteLabs razor with an exfoliating bar that removes dirt and debris before the blades, continue to drive growth in the global grooming category. GilletteLabs has reached shares greater than 20% in markets like Spain and France, and is building momentum in the U.S. and China. The global grooming category is on track for $1 billion of retail sales growth this fiscal year, with Gillette driving two-thirds of the increase, well ahead of our global share. Superior innovations like Dawn Power Wash and Dawn EZ-Squeeze in the U.S. and Fairy power spray and Fairy Max in Europe are disproportionately driving market growth in hand dishwashing with value share in the U.S. approaching 67%, merely 50% across Europe focused markets. Third strategy element productivity, improvement in all of our operations to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth, to mitigate cost and currency challenges, and to expand margins and generate cash. We're reaccelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings and cost of goods of up to $1.5 billion before tax. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chain 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain, end to end, versus simply trying to optimize each piece. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using AI tools to optimize fill rates and for dynamic routing and sourcing optimization, $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. The team has delivered strong cost savings in the first half of the year, and plans to build on this momentum. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity, using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continue to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization model. Also, an increasingly diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. So strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas we've outlined previously. Supply chain 3.0 is delivering productivity as we just talked. We're also driving improved capacity planning, greater supply agility, flexibility, data transparency, scale and resilience, all the way up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this was driving higher quality, increased supply assurance and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys. Environmental sustainability - superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are sustainable, driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. A good example is the four chamber Ariel platinum PODS innovation that we launched in a new cardboard package. Extending our superiority advantage in product performance while improving sustainability by enabling great wash results even in cold water, already contributing to a two-degree celsius reduction in wash temperatures in Europe against a five-degree target. Also extending packaging superiority with a more attractive and more sustainable cardboard box. Digital acumen - leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value. Fourth - the superior value equation for all employees, inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent, and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not new and separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe that there is merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth, and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. Now back to Andre for guidance. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results P&G people are delivering in a challenging operating and competitive environment. Continued excellent execution of an integrated market constructive strategy. I want to thank each of them for that. While we expect volatile consumer and macrodynamics to continue, we remain confident that the best path forward is to double down on the strategy that has enabled strong results and remain committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for shareholders. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. I have nothing to add on Andre's bottom line perspective. I would just reiterate one thing and add one thing on the top line. There are two questions that we've been discussing as we've gone through the first half of the year. The first relates to our ability to reaccelerate volume, which we've talked about several times in this conversation this morning. And I just want to reiterate how encouraging that progress has been. We've said it before, but it's worth saying again in our largest market, North America, past five quarters, minus 30, plus two, plus three, plus four. Europe, which tends to be fairly price sensitive, volumes, plus three. So that gives us confidence in terms of the momentum of the business on a forward basis. The other thing I would just call out that adds to this discussion is the breadth of the top line progress that the team has been making. Eight out of 10 categories held or grew sales in the quarter that we just completed, 21 of our top 25 brands did the same. And if you look at our top 12 brands, nine of those are growing at high singles or better rates. And that's inclusive of all the challenges that we're managing around the world. So that gives us confidence that the top line growth that we've been delivering should continue, just as Andre said, and that should provide the ability to continue to deliver decent levels of bottom-line growth as well. Are you saying, Lauren, that you want 30% core rates for share growth? Just kidding. All right, I'll speak first on this, and I'm sure Andre has some perspective as well. But if you look at the amount of innovation that's coming to market, both currently and in the future, and if you look at the opportunity to fully penetrate households with that innovation in ways that delights them and improves their lives, now is not the time to be pulling back on investments in marketing or commercialization efforts of that innovation. And that's where the majority of the incremental spend has come from and will come from, we look very carefully. I don't want to ignore your question on the effectiveness of that spend and continue to see through the addition of many tools and data sets that we can increase the effectiveness of that advertising, increase the return rates of that advertising as you see in our bottom line, while increasing reach. So that's what we'll be focusing on. We'll be very disciplined in that effort. Neither Andre or I or the rest of the team has any desire to spend money that isn't working for us. Robert, as Andre suggested, I'll just provide a little bit of additional color on China. Having spent a fair amount of my career involved in that market and having just spent almost a full week there, in digesting the Q2 numbers, the P&G numbers in China, you have to think about a couple things. One is SK-II, which, just for clarity for everybody, is really driven by an anti-Japanese brand sentiment which Andre described. Our opening remarks that's related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear facility, and we've had not identical but similar consumer sentiment dynamics in the past as relates to this brand and as relates to the relationship between those two countries. And it has always resolved itself with SK-II moving to higher heights. So, if you look at the decline in China on the quarter, on our business, I don't know the exact number, but basically think of it as 50% of that being the dynamic I just described and 50% of it being the market dynamics. The second thing that Andre referred to is important to understand as well. The heaviest purchase period historically in China was in November. I'm talking years past. And that was always a little bit disconcerting for us because a disproportionate amount of product moved during Double Eleven. It filled consumer pantries. It filled some retailer pantries, inventories and warehouses. It often moved at heavily discounted prices. The amount of movement during that period this year was much lower. And as Andre said, we view that as a good thing. And it's a temporary impact, a quarterly impact, a Q2 impact on the indices, but it moves us into a healthier position. If you think about the medium to longer term, Andre mentioned the expected addition of 200 million middle income consumers to China's population, that's very encouraging. Also, I mentioned I was in homes, I was in stores, I was with our retail partners. They remain encouraged about the future of China. I was talking to our organization at the end of the trip, our organization in China, and I told them I had never seen as much alignment in the market between our intentions and our strategy, our retailers intention and their strategy and the government's intention and their strategy, all focused on what's being referred to as quality market growth. As Andre suggested, that's a very good thing for us. We can play very effectively and help with that agenda, help society on a parallel path. And so, you put all that together, and I agree with Andre, and I said it earlier, I think the growth potential here remains intact. There are some specific items that exacerbate the trend that you're seeing on the quarter, but I expect this will continue to be a source of both growth and value creation for P&G. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important. Thanks, Steve. I want to step back first. We do face a lot of challenges in the world that we all live in, and those have impacted our business. But stepping back probably five years, the level of challenge has always existed, whether it was COVID, whether it was the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, whether it was the 50% reduction, 50 in our profit over two years as a result of commodities, foreign exchange, and transportation costs, and this organization overcame all of that. They've overcome the challenges we faced in the last quarter, and that gives me a huge amount of confidence that we have the ability, the skills, the strategy and the agility to continue to meet challenges, face first, and work through them in ways that are constructive for consumers, for customers, for employees, for society, and for share owners. We talk a lot internally about the complacency and the evils associated with it. So, it's front and center in our thought process. I have a couple of kind of trite sayings that I use in communicating with the organization, and one of them is that complacency kills. You don't see a complacent organization when you're looking at the breadth of growth that they're delivering. When you're looking at the continued, after a decade, continued work on productivity, yielding the kind of margin progress that we saw this quarter, you don't see it as they reinvest that into growing markets and to growing household penetration and shares. We're not immune to it, so you're right to raise it. But I feel, as you said, I feel the organization, not just myself, are very much on their front foot as they move to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. I've frankly never seen as many opportunities. Now, there's a lot of work associated with capitalizing on those opportunities, and there will be lots of challenges and forces that will be working against us in that endeavor. But the accomplishments of the midterm past, the most recent past, the reflection of the work that the organization is doing all the way down the income statement and the innovation progress that I'm seeing not only in market or coming to market, but as we review the pipelines across each of the categories also give me a good degree of confidence. I apologize. I honestly don't operate at that level of data aggregation. So, I don't have the answer with any degree of specificity, but I know the impact was there. I know it's a good thing for us long term, and apologize, but I'm just going to leave it there. And I'll just pile on. I agree with everything that Andre said. So just a couple more examples to show you again the breadth of the innovation that's been commercialized currently. He talked about Olay very exciting innovation in our hair care business as well. An example, Head & Shoulders BARE, which is a more efficacious anti-dandruff offering with the Bare minimum number of ingredients, nine to be exact. In an eco-friendly package, 45% less plastic. And it's one of the drivers of growth, particularly in North America on the Head & Shoulders brand which is up 8% fiscal year-to-date. Another example in a different category, Swiffer PowerMop, which is driving that business up 11% fiscal year-to-date and has built both volume and value of share at about 1.5 level so that's... And back to Steve's question on complacency, this is what we need to keep doing and that's why we talk about the best path forward being doubling down on exactly these things. They do drive market, they do drive volume, they do drive sales and they do it profitably. Let me just take China real quick and then turn it over to Andre. On the cough, cold trend, et cetera. The mid-single-digit number that we referred to, is an expectation of longer-term market growth. You're correct. It is not an expectation of ours for either the market or our business in this current fiscal year. On the broader beauty question, when you take SK-II and the market impacts in China out of the equation. You see a business that's performing extraordinarily well. I mentioned Head & Shoulders, which is the largest shampoo brand in the world up 8% fiscal year-to-date. If you look at North America, Pantene fiscal year-to-date up 15%. Our skin and personal care business up double-digits. The same is true for the beauty business in Enterprise LA and in Europe. So it's a very strong business benefiting from the exact same strategies obviously applied differently that we're executing across the balance of the company. And that will, over time, as the market corrects itself, be demonstrated in China as well. Just one thing on that, sorry to interrupt, Andre - that I think is relatively straightforward, but it's worth mentioning. As we were all coming out of COVID going through our first cough our - first non-COVID or like COVID, cough cold season, it's not surprising having, but spent time in our homes for the last two to three years that the level of immunity was not high and therefore the level of incidence was very high. So that's what we're annualizing against combined with a slower start to the normal season. As Andre says, we'll wait to see how that all materializes. We have seen some increase in incidence. You can probably hear a little bit of a frog in my voice this morning and I heard one in Andre's. It's just an end of one, Jason. So it's kind of irrelevant. But I was in the home of a heavy SK-II user in Beijing. And I asked her about this dynamic and how it was affected in her purchasing. And she kind of laughed, and it wasn't the normal nervous laugh. It was - and she said she followed that up with, if Japanese consumers aren't afraid of this, why should I be. And she said, I'm much more afraid of the pimple that I will get, if I don't use this than I am about. So it's starting to normalize again, that's and of one. It was also interesting to me to see, what was happening with her kind of personal inventory and just looking at the liquid fill levels in the bottles, which were low. So I think, there's a dynamic as well, where a number of consumers just kind of waited to see how this whole thing played out, and reduce their personal stocks in the process. But again, that's probably neither here nor there, but I thought it was worth sharing. Yes, these decisions are not taken lightly. A couple of points. One is where we're moving to an import model, which will be the case in Nigeria. We maintain an option on the future of those brands in those markets. We're just choosing to operate in a way that's - that frankly is viable. You get into some tough situations in some of these markets with currency controls with pricing controls with the ability to dividend money out of these markets. And at some point, you run into a set of conditions that just make it impossible operate. You can't get - you can't source dollars as an example, in order to purchase the ingredients and raw materials, you need to manufacture your products. And so, we've come to a decision when those situations present themselves to be pragmatic to be value creative and to flow resources to bigger opportunities that present more near-term opportunity, while in some cases, maintaining our optionality on the long-term. Andre, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. By the way, as a prior CFO would have had no hope of explaining that to you as Andre Schulten is the current CFO just did. You want to talk competitive promotion, Andre, and then I'll talk to customers. The whole idea, just building on Andre's last point there, is to create business not take business. And that works out well for us. It works out well for the categories that we compete in and it works out well for our retail partners. And that is really the focus of the existing interchange with our retail partners. It was number one, two and three supply as we've solidified our supply chains. The conversation moves very quickly to how do we work together to grow markets. That's a win-win-win proposition, a win for them, a win for us, a win for consumers. And of course, adding a fourth win for shareowners. So that's the state of play. And I experienced that in Europe, I experienced - I was in Europe as before Christmas. As you know, I was just in China, that was the nature of the conversation there, and it's clearly the nature of the conversation here in the U.S. I'd offer a couple thoughts there. One, China is our second largest market, sales and profits. Beauty represents a significantly disproportionate amount of the business. So, if we weren't committed to the beauty business in China, you'd have to ask yourself a different question. Second, when we did our significant portfolio restructuring, however many years ago, that was now into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, we did the same with beauty. Exiting the most fickle to use your semantics portions of the business. We exited what I call fashion fragrances and flavors. The brands that we have remaining and the categories that we play in, there's real opportunity to drive long-term loyalty with superior performance. That's true in China, that's true outside of China. And there will always be a higher trial rate in that category than in many other categories. That's not a bad thing. It helps demonstrate the superiority of what we do offer and people come back to our brands. So now - if the question is commitment to beauty in China, the answer is yes. We convinced ourselves for years that what mattered most in Europe was price, specifically the lower the better. And that wasn't an uninformed decision. You had the highest development of heavy discounters, for example, in Europe, which would then indicate that price is an important part of the consumer value proposition. But as Andre said, in the last number of years, we've really pushed innovation as a driver of value, not forgetting about value, but delivering it through performance. And that, combined with the executional capability of that market, which has just been phenomenal. And I want to thank them all as long as you've given me the opportunity to do that, has led to just really terrific results and I believe sustainable results. Great. Thank you for your time this morning. I know it's a little bit of a difficult quarter to unpack. There's a lot going on. The net of that, although is very positive, strong really strong earnings per share growth while increasing investments in the business, both present future maintaining top line momentum, building volume momentum and building share. As I expressed before, I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve a level of success going forward, and that's based entirely on both the strategy and the ability of our organization to deliver against that. Look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a month or so, and we'll advance the conversation at that point. We're around John Chevalier sitting across the table from me right now. He's around all day. Andre is around. They'll get angry if you call me, so call them, but have a great day. Thanks."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jon Chevalier, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for the October to December quarter, Jon will add perspective on our recent results and strategic focus areas and capabilities. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '24, and then take your questions. October to December, was another strong quarter. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market-share results and another quarter of strong margin progress, delivering strong earnings and cash results for the quarter. The strong results we've delivered in the first half of fiscal '24, enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners. We continue to see the upper range on organic sales and core EPS as likely outcome for fiscal '23 - '24. So, moving to second quarter numbers, organic sales grew 4%, volume rounded down to a decline of one point as continued volume acceleration in North America and Europe focused markets was offset by softer shipments in Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East, Africa regions due to local issues in select markets. Pricing contributed four points to sales growth, consistent with the guidance we provided, mix was neutral to organic sales growth. Growth across categories continues to be broad based with eight of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales this quarter. Home care, hair care and grooming grew sales high single digits. Fabric care, family care, feminine care and oral care were up mid-single digits. Baby care was in line with prior year. Personal health care was down low singles against a very tough comp and a late developing cold and flu season this year. Skin and personal care was down mid singles due to SK-II in China. Growth was also broad based across geographies with North America, Europe, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets each growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter and enterprise markets grew 7%. Organic sales in North America grew 5% with four points of volume growth. Over the last five quarters, volume growth in North America has been minus three, flat, then 2% growth plus 3% and now plus 4%, strong acceleration well ahead of the underlying market trends. Europe focused markets were up 7% with three points of volume growth. As expected, both regions saw a step down in pricing contribution to sales growth as a large portion of price increases from last year have annualized. Importantly, volume accelerated in both regions to partially offset the pricing impact. Latin America delivered another very strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth, continued strong results in these regions. There are some targeted issues affecting other markets. Greater China organic sales were down minus 15% versus prior year. Underlying market growth was down mid to high single digits as consumer confidence weakened further. The SK-II brand in Greater China was down 34% due to soft market conditions and a temporary headwind for Japanese brands in the market. Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half. Underlying market trends have softened in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, following multiple rounds of pricing to offset inflation and due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 20 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 50 basis points reflecting strong volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 90 basis points over the past three months. In summary, North America, Europe focus Markets, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America, which combined represent three-quarters of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in quarter two, with three points of volume growth and three points of price mix. These same markets grew 9% in quarter one with around two points of volume growth and seven points of price mix. Continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing, consistent with our guidance. The balanced 25% of company sales including Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa were impacted by local market issues we described. Quarter two organic sales for this group were down five points versus prior year. We expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing, SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve, and over time return to mid singles, and we expect market pressures in the Middle east and Turkey to ease over time. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.84, up 16% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core operating margin increased 400 basis points as 520 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation and foreign exchange impacts in SG&A. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 470 basis points. Productivity improvements were a very strong 340 basis points helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall progress in the first half of the year keeping us on track for our fiscal year guidance ranges. Now I'll pass it over to Jon for his perspective. Thanks Jon. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong first half results enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. This outlook includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that we began to see in our second quarter results as the market lapsed the last waves of cost recovery pricing. For P&G, we expect the pricing contribution to topline growth to reduce by an additional 1 to 2 points in the back half of the year. We will continue to price for new innovations when warranted and to mitigate FX impacts. On the bottom line enabled by very strong earnings growth in the first half of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal '24 core earnings per share from a range of 6% to 9% to a range of 8% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. This guidance implies slower bottom-line growth in the second half. As we highlighted last quarter, the second half of the fiscal year will see less pricing benefit as we annualize more prior year increases. We will also see less commodity cost benefit in the second half. Wage and benefit inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our direct costs, and FX headwinds will increase versus the first half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we continue to expect organic sales and core EPS growth toward the upper end of the renewed guidance ranges. We estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to expect foreign exchange will be a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax for the fiscal year. The vast majority of this impact is driven by Argentina, and is heavily skewed towards the back half of the year. This outlook is based on a forecast for continued significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso, which we expect to largely offset with appropriate price increases. We now expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs weakness are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain superior value for consumers and retailers. Now, I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts. Yes, morning Dara, let me start and Jon will add. On the top line, if you look at the first half, we are right in line with what we're projecting for the year, an average of 5%, and we obviously then expect about 5% for the back half. We see volatility, as you had pointed out in some geographies that we mentioned in the script. I think the core point though is the core geography, 75% of the sales are performing very well. We continue to see acceleration in volume growth in North America with 4% volume growth, 5% sales growth. Europe is very strong. Latin America very strong. We continue to see volume acceleration in most places. So that gives us confidence that that projects well for the second half of the year. We also expect some of the volatility that we experienced in quarter two to disappear or at least improve in the second half. The SK-II sentiment is improving based on our consumer research in China, and we are continuing to drive innovation, equity investment and really relying on our most loyal and passionate user base to help amplify that messaging, which is working well. So, we expect the effects to improve year-over-year - quarter over quarter. From an enterprise market standpoint, we also view the pricing impacts that are impacting some of the markets like Turkey to disappear over time, as pricing in the market is established, competitive pricing catches up and then the impact of the tensions in the Middle East certainly hopefully will improve as well. So very strong continued performance on the core markets, which are 75% of the sales, and we expect somewhat improving trends and stabilization in the other 25%. On the EPS side, very strong performance in the front half, 17% in quarter one, 16% in quarter two, sets us up well for the upper end of their guidance range, which is reflected in the tightening of their guidance. However, to keep in mind, we see a reversal of a number of effects that have supported the half one results. We saw the majority of the commodity help flow through in the first half, and this is part of the improvement in quarter two EPS. We see the flow through happening faster than we would have anticipated in some instances, so that leaves less of a contribution for the second half. We also have the majority of the foreign exchange hurt in the second half, about 75% of FX hurt of the billion dollars will hit the second half. As we indicated, the majority of that is Argentina, so we will try to offset via appropriate pricing. Nevertheless, the growth impact is tilted towards the back half. Price mix contribution will ease. We saw still significant contribution in the first half, that will lower by 1 point to 2 points in the back half, which also has an impact on EPS growth. And lastly, we continue to see wage inflation in our own operation as well as in our supply chain flowing through. Now, that being said, if everything goes well, could there be upside? Sure. But we believe that guidance is appropriately reflecting the potential variability here. So those are the core drivers. Jon, any perspective? Hi, Bryan. No, what I was talking was the full year expectation. So again, we reiterate the range of four to five, but we see the possibility and strong probability that we'll be able to deliver towards the upper end of that range for the fiscal year. Yes. And maybe just to add, we just talked with our team actually about being very granular about the assessment of the ROI. So, we don't have good investments, cover for bad investments. So really go down to the country level, to the brand level, to the channel level when we assess whether we are getting a payout on the investments. But the majority of the spend, as Jon said, is really focused on driving market growth. When you think about the opportunity on FE, for example, we've created 100% of the market growth in North America on FE, and it's still the biggest opportunity the team has in order to continue to accelerate both our own growth in a constructive way and the market given the low penetration FE has - Fabric Enhancers. Oran-B, another example, a power Oral-B was launched - Oral-B iO10 and we're also expanding distribution of Oral-B iO3, 4 and 5. We've led 70% of global market growth with those launches. So, communicating the benefit and driving penetration is a huge opportunity. So be assured we look at ROI very carefully. And again, market growth continues to be the main area of focus when we invest incrementally. I'll start. Morning Robert. Look, the US continues to be very solid, continues to impress with I think a very smooth transition from pricing, annualizing and overall consumption coming up in terms of volume, which is enabling us to post the volume improvements Jon was quoting over the past few quarters, and still accelerating ahead of market with 4% volume growth and 50 basis points of market share growth. We continue to see trade up within our propositions. So as consumers come in, maybe at a lower tier and a lower value proposition, they continue to trade up in the U.S., which speaks to the health of the proposition but also the health of the consumer and willingness to invest. The last data point I'll give you on the U.S. is we are able to grow as private label shares are slightly up, we are up the same range. So, some consumers will look for value in private label, but an equal if not higher amount of consumers find better value in our propositions as we drive continued superiority via innovation. So, feel very strongly about the U.S., we'll continue to invest to drive more market growth there, but the consumer is resilient and the business is doing well. On China, I'll begin. I'm sure Jon has incremental perspective, but the China opportunity remains intact. If you look at the underlying market size, if you look at the potential development of the middle class, if you look at the ability to drive category penetration in our categories, all of those are huge opportunities for us, and all of those point to continued investment and commitment to the Chinese market. We have a very capable organization, and we continue to be very optimistic that we can create value. Honestly, when the market requires market growth to be driven by manufacturers, I think that positions us very well with our retail partners in China to have a competitive advantage and execute the model that we know how to execute in many parts of the world. In the short term, we mentioned it in the script, consumer sentiment is not fully recovered yet, and that is reflected in the results. Again, if you want to take a silver lining, we see the attractiveness of key opinion leaders and heavy discounting in key consumption periods decreasing. And that's actually good for us. And we believe that a focus on brand equity, a focus on strong everyday value via the priority, will allow us to help grow the market back to mid-single digits and strengthen our position in the market. Last point on SK-II, no specifics. The numbers we're quoting, obviously on the quarter, minus 34% include the domestic travel retail channel. Nothing else to add there other than we remain confident that as the sentiment improves, which we see already, with continued investment in SK-II, we see that business recovering over the back half. Yes. Hi Chris, let me start. On the non-covered channel side, we've seen non-covered outpace cover channels for a period of time. This is not different. There's nothing specific happening there. We see a trend of some consumers going into larger pack sizes. Those are in club, those are online, and many of those effects continue. But there's nothing differential between covered and non-covered channels. Both are performing well. Non-covered a little bit ahead of covered, so that's why you don't see the results in the track data. What's driving the growth? I would argue it's all of the above that you've mentioned, right. I think, we're seeing pricing lapping, consumers seeing the pricing normalizing on the shelf. We don't see an increase in promotion depth or frequency, quite frankly. We are still operating at about 85% of pre-COVID levels from a volume sold on deal perspective. Competition is in a similar range, so there's no escalation of promotion. But what drives it, is strong innovation, innovation that is focused on growing the market, and strong communication of that innovation in a very targeted way, leveraging our capability, to be very detailed and very intentional on who we talk to, at what point in time, with what messaging. The U.S. is probably our most sophisticated market in that regard, and it shows in the ROIs and in the results - back to Lauren's question earlier. A few examples. Just the Gillette business, innovation on the core with the Labs razor provides a growth driver. But adding new jobs to be done, like female facial hair removal or male and female body hair removal, incremental jobs that when communicated appropriately of the benefit of the product drive incremental consumption. I mentioned Oral-B, penetration still low on the electric toothbrush. And as we're converting more and more users, that drives incremental growth with more innovation, but also expansion of the lower-priced options of Oral-B i03, 4, and 5, and then the launch of Oral-B 10. Last example, I'll give you and then I'll let Jon add is Olay Super Serum. Just to cover a few of the categories here is a new serum. The most successful new serum in the category, 30% of those users are new to the category. So again, communication, strong innovation, premium propositions, and bringing new crews to the categories, is what's driving that accelerated volume growth. So on the other two questions on PHC, Andrea look the business is obviously very, very strong past for your average growth rate of 13%. So, the underlying strength of the business is very healthy. We see an impact of the core cost season. The season is still above average, but it's below a record season last year and it's developing a little bit slower in the current profile, which means there could be some upside coming - as time goes by. Last year Vicks was 28% in the same quarter, so you can see the high base that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Right, we're contributing. There we go. Just last point on PHC, if you look at the share development in every treatment area that we cover in PHC, we're up in share. In every treatment area, we're up in organic sales across regions. So again, it's purely a seasonal element. On distribution, Andrea, I won't give you an answer other than obviously driving innovation, driving incremental sales for our retail partners, driving category growth helps with their desire to have our brands present on their shelves. Hi, Peter. The commodity basket is wide, complex, and changing very quickly. So the best guess we have is what we told you, $800 million of tailwind for the year, which the majority of which has been flown through the P&L in the front half. What I'll leave you with, I don't expect any headwind from commodity in the second half. It continues to be a tailwind. The second thought I'll leave you with, is the impact on the P&L given the time it takes for commodity changes to flow through our contract structures and our own variance holding policy, make the time lag significant. So, even if we saw significant volatility on commodity spot prices, the impact on the fiscal will decrease over time simply, because of those two dynamics. But continue to expect tailwinds just less than you saw in half one. So the volume - we don't see a transitory effect on the volume side Jason, good morning first of all. So the base, there is always some base volatility if you know in terms of inventories, in terms of our ability to ship, but there is no material impact that I would call out that would have to be taken into account, if you look at the U.S. volume results. So nothing there. The SK-II improvement again, I want to pace expectations, but the improvement is really in the consumer sentiment that we're seeing, where we had very high social media coverage in quarter one, leading to negative sentiment and negative top-of-mind awareness of the brand, that is now dying down and honestly most consumers have gone back, to a neutral position, open to SK-II. And so, what we're doing is really doubling down with innovation and doubling down with communication on the efficacy, the quality of the product, the quality of the brand and leveraging the most loyal and passionate consumer group to help us make the case for SK-II, which we believe will help us improve run rates in the second half. The market dynamics, we continue to see bumpy, even over the next quarters improving, but there will be volatility there. Yes, I just want to clarify, because the strategic intent really is what Jon described, right? We are moving in Nigeria to an import market, we will still be present, but it's a better way to serve the consumer and a better way for us to create value. In Argentina, we are divesting our fabric and home care business, and again, are looking to find a better go-to-market model. The language you're quoting Callum is substantial liquidation, that's an accounting term. And that accounting term, is really defining the point at which we recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss in those markets, which is part of that noncash restructuring that we talked about. So the accounting term doesn't represent the business execution. It is a technical term that once we get to that point of substantial liquidation, we will recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss. I won't comment. Happy to. Hi, Olivia, so I started to mention this in the U.S. Our promotion level is still below pre-COVID about an 85 index competitive promotion level around 90 index. So very similar. We don't see a substantial increase in either depth or frequency in U.S. In Europe, we do see an increase in frequency, we do not see any increase in depth. Actually, both frequency and depth are still below pre-COVID levels, but frequency is increasing. So competitive environment still stable. And I think it's also driven by the fact that we are driving growth. We are driving market growth, and that contributes to the share growth, which means we can grow, but also it doesn't drive necessarily negative cycles in terms of pricing in the market. Look, I think the execution of the strategy in Europe is really behind the strength of the results. The team has done a fantastic job in combining the price increases that needed to be taken to recover the commodity cost increases with very strong innovation that delights the consumer at the time when they see higher pricing materialize on the shelf. And that's really behind the benign volume impact as we took the pricing and behind the acceleration of volume growth now that pricing is established in the market. We've done that. A few examples. Jon mentioned Ariel, I mentioned Ariel as well, but Ariel parts in a more sustainable packaging launched with the price increase that we needed to take has been building organic sales by up to 20% or higher. So the results are really a combination of strong innovation, pricing and therefore, maintaining consumers coming into the franchise and trading up not different from the U.S."

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This fiscal year, Jon Moeller, Chairman, President and CEO, will join the mid-year and year-end calls and I'll be leading the Q1 and Q3 calls. Execution of our integrated strategy draws strong results in the July to September quarter. Broad-based organic sales growth across categories and regions, global aggregate market share growth, strong productivity savings enabling increased investment in superiority of our brands while also delivering very strong earnings growth. These strong first quarter results put us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth and core earnings per share, and continued strong cash productivity and cash return to share owners. So moving to first quarter numbers, organic sales grew 7%. Pricing added 7 points to sales growth, and mixed contributed 1 point. Volume rounded down to a decline of 1 point with overall modest volume growth outside greater China. Top-line growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care grew low teens, personal healthcare was up double digits, feminine care, oral care, fabric care, hair care and grooming, each grew high single digits. Baby care and family care were up mid-singles, skin and personal care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies, with five of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 6% for the quarter, organic sales in the US were up 7% and Europe focus markets were up 15%. Greater China organic sales were down 6% versus prior year. Underlying market growth is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak. SK-II was down low teens in Greater China due to soft market conditions and a temporary reduction in social retail merchandising. Enterprise markets were up 13%, with Latin America up 19%, and Europe enterprise markets up 15%. Shipment volume in the US grew 3% again this quarter and we returned to volume growth in Europe focus markets. Mexico, Brazil and India, some of our largest enterprise markets, continue to deliver volume growth. These gains largely offset volume declines in the Greater China, Asia Pacific and European enterprise regions primarily driven by underlying market contraction. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 32 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was up 50 basis points versus prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing value share in the quarter. US volume share was up 60 basis points, reflecting 3% volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 40 basis points over the past three months. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.83, up 17% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 21%. Core operating margin increased 240 basis points, as 460 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation, and foreign exchange impacts on SG&A. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 340 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 210 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash for productivity was 97%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, a very good start to the fiscal year across top-line, bottom line, and cash. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past five years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value across each price tier we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in the volatile environment we're in. Finally an organization that is more empowered, agile, and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas, supply chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability, and the employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation, and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. Moving to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs, to currencies, to consumer and geopolitical dynamics. We attempt to reflect these realities in our guidance ranges. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal \u201824. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in July. However, within this estimate, there have been several moving parts. We've seen incremental relief on some commodities like pulp, which have been offset by higher costs than other commodities such as fuel. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us, and we now expect a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax, an incremental $600 million impact since our initial guidance for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits, and we expect higher year-on-year net interest expense of approximately $200 million after tax. As we are just one quarter into the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for organic sales, core EPS growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, with each solidly on track after a very strong first quarter. Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. The range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rate that is likely to occur through calendar year \u201824 as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth. For P&G, we expect 3 to 4 points less pricing benefit in each of the next two quarters compared to our first quarter results. On the bottom line, our outlook for fiscal \u201824 core earnings per share is 6% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. We're holding the range despite the incremental $600 million after-tax headwind from foreign exchange. With now a 7-point EPS impact from FX, this outlook translates to 13% to 16% core EPS growth on a constant-currency basis. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. As you consider the cadence of earnings for the year, keep in mind that the back half of the year will see less pricing benefit as we progressively annualize prior year increases. We should also see less commodity benefit as we move through the year. Labor inflation continues throughout the supply chain and [in our] (ph) costs. FX headwinds will increase versus quarter one. Also with a strong start to the year, we'll be reinvesting to further strengthen our plans and to maintain strong momentum. Finally, we'll be closely watching the health of the China market and the balance of regions, energy costs are rising as we head into fall and winter, household saving levels have reduced, especially in Europe. Slower economic growth, higher energy costs and higher interest rates for longer have an impact on consumer confidence. To conclude, while we expect volatile consumer and market dynamics to continue, we remain confident in our strategy and the results that it delivers. We are focused on driving growth in our categories and we are committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Good morning, Andre. I guess just picking up on your comments on organic growth over the balance of the year, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the progression of price versus volume versus mix over the remainder of the year. And then I'm curious as to whether your approach to balancing those various drivers differs at all between your focus markets, particularly the US and the enterprise markets where you're experiencing more of the currency headwinds? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Steve. We -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect the market to return to a lower, more sustainable growth rate more in line with historical growth at around 4%. That will have a stronger contribution on the volume side. We would expect that to be around 2% -- 1% to 2% of pricing and maybe a point of mix impact. That will occur over the next few quarters and as always, P&G is intending to grow ahead of the market. So really, our expectation for the year is to be slightly ahead of the market in terms of volume and slightly ahead in terms of price. We continue to believe that we can price with strong innovation. And we have gained even more confidence over the past two years that our strategy of pricing with innovation to drive superiority and create value for the consumer is working. And so we fully expect to return to that pattern. And again, pricing has been a core component of our growth for 18 out of the last 19 years, so we expect that to continue. Specifically, I think the pricing will start to lap in quarter two. So you will see probably the price contribution drop to -- by 3 to 4 points in quarter two, and that was expected. And we then sequentially expect volumes to pick up and offset part of that but do expect a lower overall market growth rate for the balance of the year. To your second part of the question, enterprise markets versus focus markets, I think the only differential would be foreign exchange. And we'll continue to price for foreign exchange. We've done that very successfully across the world. Turkey is a major example where we've been able to price for the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira, but we are able to grow share, grow sales, grow profit. We'll continue that model. Outside of that, we'll continue to do and drive the same business model we're driving in focus markets, innovate, drive superiority, price, grow markets and thereby grow sales, profit and share.\nOperator: Next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. So just to follow up on that. Can you characterize what you're seeing competitively in terms of the pricing environment? Obviously, it will be different by geography and product category. But in general, what type of behavior are you seeing from your competitors? And any thoughts around retailer pushback as commodities have turned favorable year-over-year? And just then in terms of volume growth, it sounds like we should expect a return to volume growth. Just what you think your level of visibility is around that and how much comfort you have and ultimately returning to volume growth as pricing drops off? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Dara. When you look at the total market, it's very consistent with previous periods. You still see average market growth of around 6% to 7%. And you see still the price component being a significant driver. Volumes are stabilizing at a global level. Minus a point to flat, depending on the geography. You look at the only exception being Greater China. So the price component and the price rollover is consistent period-over-period. So no differentiation there from a competitive standpoint, at least not that we see it. Promotion continues to be -- promotion levels and other indicator continue to be below pre-COVID levels. In the US, for example, volumes sold on deal is now at about 29%. Overall promotion level is still [indexed 80] (ph) versus pre-COVID. In Europe, we also see promotions still down and actually sequentially decreasing. Now it's a different dynamic by market, obviously, but when we aggregate up, it looks like over the past few quarters, promotion activity is actually still decreasing. And that makes sense. If you look at the relatively little or small help to commodity costs, we see about $800 million after-tax help offset by about $1 billion of foreign exchange. And recall, we're coming from two years, which combined have an impact of $7 billion of headwinds. So I think everybody is still recovering so the current pricing dynamic makes sense. We have not experienced retailer pushback beyond normal discussions on how to maximize value for their shoppers and for consumers overall. And again, our model of driving innovation and therefore, superiority and sales, while we price and create value for retailers and shoppers seems to be resonating. On the volume side, we feel very good about where we are in the trajectory of volume growth. Again, excluding China, we're already seeing volume growth of 20 basis points, sequential improvement in -- versus the prior quarters, which we would have expected. And again, that's in the context of 7% pricing still flowing into the market. We expect volumes will continue to grow. US strong. As we said, Europe, strong. Latin America and India are strong. So we continue to see us progressing on that trajectory.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. I want to drill in on China a little bit. Number one, kind of in the short term, how is the business there progressing? Any visibility or improvement there? And when do you think that may turn positive? And then, a little bit longer term or kind of strategically, we are hearing from some of the other companies we talk to that the Chinese market may not be as profitable and attractive as perhaps they may have thought a number of years ago and that perhaps the nature of competition is changing in China again. So I'd love to get your thoughts on both China in the short term and the long term. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I think we said all along that we don't expect the China recovery to be quick, extensive or linear. And I think that's playing out. The business health in China is really all driven by market dynamics right now. So total market volume continues to be down. It has been down over the past few quarters between 7% and 9%. Value is down around 5% over the past few quarters, and that's the market I'm describing. So we're operating within a market that is still contracting post-COVID reopening. That said, we do believe that China continues to be an attractive place for us to do business. We've been there for 30 years. We have a very strong organization on the ground, R&D capability, supply chain capability and commercial capability. The Chinese consumer is a demanding consumer. The Chinese retail environment is a demanding retail environment and that generally plays to our strength. So we believe that, a, we can play a value-creating role in China, and we expect the Chinese market to return to mid-single-digit growth here over the coming periods. If you just look at the consumer structures, middle-income consumers, we have about 450 million, we estimate in China today. That will grow probably north of 700 million over the next five years. So there is a class of consumers that we believe are attractive for our businesses. And therefore, we believe that our business in China can create significant value over the next few years and we'll continue to remain invested.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You've mentioned a return to volume growth in European focus markets, which is great to see, and obviously, market shares have generally held up well. But we started to see some pickup in private label share trends across Europe. You mentioned the European consumer being under pressure. So just kind of curious maybe some more broad thoughts there on Europe on market share trends that you're seeing more real time versus what's kind of already transpired in the reported results, more the go-forward look on European shares and volume trends? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Yep. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Look, the European -- let me focus here on the Western European side because I think that's where your question is relevant. Look, we've seen 15% organic sales growth in Europe focus markets, which is incredibly strong, a combination of 2% volume growth and strong price/mix. We have 40 basis points of share growth across the same geographies that is returning to volume growth, and that generally are positive signs. Yes, private label shares in Europe are growing. They continue to grow at about an 80 basis point clip month-over-month. But that still enables us to grow share in the same geographies. And I think that share growth is enabled by a strong portfolio across different brand tiers, across different cash outlays. The fact that we are present in all relevant channels across Europe, and that allows us to effectively compete even as consumers look at the private label versus branded value creation, the balance seems to be still in our favor.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. I guess I have two connected questions. One is, if we look at first quarter and even in your commentary about guidance, maybe higher end of the range, I know you've talked a lot -- you've talked a bit about some of the risks in the market. But just like what's been better so far this year is one question. So just that. And then related to that also, you talked about reinvestment. So if you can just give us some sense of kind of the sizing that reinvestment and maybe where those dollars are going.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Bryan. If you look at the first quarter, I think the -- we are encouraged by the combination of factors here on the consumption side. Again, volume -- return to volume growth outside of China, we expect the China to be choppy as we said all along. But even with China down, we've been able to grow 7% and that certainly has been encouraging to us. And the depth and breadth of that growth, both across value and volume outside of China is really encouraging us and giving us confidence that the model will continue to drive results that point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. On the reinvestment side, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest when the return of that investment is attractive. It won't be driven by availability of funds. It will be driven by ability to create an attractive return. Our first priority, as you can imagine, in this current environment is to invest in ideas that drive market growth. So investing in products, investing in innovation that is driving new jobs to be done, investing in media spending that is driving household penetration, investing in communication to the consumer that drives usage in the right way to drive better delight for the consumer will be key. A couple of examples. Ninjamas in bedwetters was a sleepy category. We entered a couple of years ago. The category is growing 7%. We were able to drive 60% of that growth, which is six times our fair share. Those are great examples where we can continue to invest, drive growth for the business, drive growth for our retailers and create value for shareholders. We continue to see opportunities in media as we get sharper and sharper on our targeting across media around the world and our [capabilities are scaled] (ph). The ROI gets better. So we'll continue to drive up reach. We continue to drive up frequency. And again, that is a core driver for us to drive household penetration, drive trial, which will turn into loyalty and repeat. The last bucket I will give you is investing in supply, resilience and productivity. Our supply chain resilience, we see as a core competitive advantage for our retail partners and for ourselves. So we'll continue to ensure that our capacity to demand ratio is where we want it to be. And investing in productivity, we believe, has a high payout and is critical for us to continue the investment in superiority, which is part of the business model. So those are the headlines, but be reassured, we'll do it on a very disciplined basis with return on investment as the top priority.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Andre, your comments about volume, I would like to drill down a little bit. You mentioned China. I believe you are still looking to a mid-single-digit growth and obviously, I understand the choppiness of the market. And you had SK-II down in the low teens. So I'm assuming for that to happen, you're expecting SK-II to gradually improve or lap easier comps as we go through the balance of the year. And then when you mentioned -- like doing the math when you said pricing, as we decompose your guidance, right, the 4% to 5% organic total company, you mentioned expect sequential 3% to 4% decline in the benefit of pricing, right? So it was a good 7%, so you would be implying to us 3% to 4% in the next two quarters. So with that being said, it implies in the next two quarters, some sort of improvement in volume, right, or at least some sort of inflection. So I was trying to figure that out in the context of what you said about China and what you said about total company, basically what it regresses to -- regresses to an improvement in China? Is that what we should be thinking?\nAndre Schulten: So first part -- good morning, Andrea. First part of your question, we obviously want to see SK-II return to growth but the volume impact of SK-II is relatively limited because the volume to organic sales ratio obviously is very high unit sales. So China, we believe, will return to mid-single-digit growth. When exactly that's going to happen is really hard to predict. And I would say, like we have delivered 7% organic sales growth in the first quarter with China down, I think we'll continue to operate, and not counting on China recovery as the core catalyst to growth for the coming quarters. On your sequential question on volume, you're right. As we said, the pricing contribution to organic sales growth will decrease 3 to 4 points over the coming quarters. And we expect volume to progress sequentially. The exact trajectory of that progression, I think, is questionable, and I won't make a prediction here. But I'll tell you that the progress we're seeing from minus 6% to minus 3% to flat -- to minus 1% to now flat, is pointing in that right direction. So we see we're on the right path, and we will continue to invest to drive wholesale penetration and create that volume growth in our business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Andre, you talked about the changes in FX and how you've been able to absorb that into the fiscal year outlook. Can you discuss what's embedded in your outlook in terms of the consumer, the economy? Obviously, increasing risk or concerns around trade downs, slower volumes and macros in general. So if you could talk about that. And then also your ability and -- your ability to switch between spending that is either net to sales versus operating expense in light of potentially volatile conditions. Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. Good morning. Look, the consumer continues to be remarkably resilient. As we said in the US, the consumption levels are actually stable. Our volume share and our value share are growing. And that's true in Europe and in most parts of the world. And I interpret that as our portfolio doing exactly the job that it's supposed to do. And building a portfolio that is grounded in superiority in daily use categories that are nondiscretionary, I think, is serving us extremely well. We're able to add value, bring value to the consumer. And we are doing that in every tier, not just in the premium tier, but in the mid-tier and in value tiers across the world, which allows us to serve the consumer even as their spending preferences might change. Now, we haven't seen a significant change in their preference yet. If anything, consumers that are choosing P&G products continue to trade up within our portfolio. But you can see our ability to grow in markets even when we see private label shares expand. And so we don't expect a significant change in that profile. And we believe we are well set up to grow even if the consumer feels a bit of -- more of a pinch here going into the fall or winter season. The main intervention for us continues to be investing in innovation and continue to invest in media support to communicate the strength and the value that our brands can provide. We don't see a significant need to drive price promotion. Our focus, if we promote, if we look for in-store support is really to drive regimen. So we view it as a strategic tool to drive either trial or habit formation, i.e., regimen steps added to the laundry regime or the hair care regime, for example, because that drives incremental consumption, it drives growth for our retail partners and for us. In many cases, our innovation is strong enough to get in-store support, and that's really what we're after. When the product in and of itself generates enough traffic and consumption so retailers want to support it, that's the golden grade we\u2019re after.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could expand on two categories, which have been important for volume growth and seemingly should be important ahead. Just first on laundry. We've seen an improvement, a reacceleration in trend. Can you just expand on what's driving that and the durability? And then second, in personal healthcare, I believe that was an important driver of volume growth for the quarter. Can you just expand on what exactly was driving that in the quarter and if you think those trends are also sustainable go forward? So I'm just trying to get a sense of some of the volume durability that we saw in the quarter go forward, specifically in the context of potentially some volatility out of China likely to persist. Thanks so much.\nAndre Schulten: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good morning. The laundry business is very encouraging. Results around the world are very strong. Let me focus on the US market because that's -- it's the biggest market and you have the highest visibility to. But if you look at the trends, they are very encouraging. We are now growing value and volume share in US fabric care. Value share has been flat over the past three months. Volume share has been up 1.6 points. So we continue to push the laundry business forward. We have record high fabric enhancer shares and we have record high laundry consumption in the US. Most importantly, I think, is the fact that we're driving 70% of the category growth in laundry, and we're driving 100% of the category growth in fabric enhancers. And it's really driven by strong innovation, strong superiority and doubling down on consumer relevant communication and in-store support. So I fully believe that this will only accelerate. And to your question, yes, it is sustainable because it's just in line with the business model. PHC is doing extremely well around the world. And obviously, the seasonality here plays a key role. Going into the season, we see strong results, which is part of the strength in volumes that you see. And the last part I'll leave you with is we've invested significantly and continue to invest in strengthening our supply capability in personal healthcare, which will be needed to support that strong growth going forward. But feel good about both businesses. And yes, I think the trajectory is absolutely sustainable.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, Andre. Just a question on gross margin. Clearly, very strong, the performance in the quarter. Big inflection in terms of the year-over-year increase. You seem like you have pretty good visibility in the first half, at least on the commodity front. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking the second half will play out, especially as pricing contribution comes down? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Filippo. Yeah, when we talked about the cadence of earnings, I think it's important to understand the drivers of the gross margin expansion we saw in quarter one. And we expect some normalization of gross margin. We were certainly benefiting from a high price contribution in quarter one. And as we said, that price contribution will ease over the coming quarters. The biggest part of the commodity help, about 33% of the $800 million after-tax commodity help has materialized in quarter one. So that's a positive to gross margin relative to the balance of the year. And the foreign exchange rate headwinds will accelerate over the coming quarters. On the other hand, we will accelerate and continue to drive strong productivity. We will continue to drive trade-up and innovation. And we continue to drive every other element of productivity, not only in gross margin, but across the P&L and the balance sheet. But I want you to take away that the gross margin expansion in quarter one is very strong, but we have headwinds going into the balance of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. And good morning, Andre. Hope you are doing well. So I wanted to ask specifically on Latin America, 19% growth in the quarter, very strong. And you may have alluded to this, but are you already seeing a return to volume growth in the region? And then just thinking through the performance in the quarter, can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing in terms of broader category performance versus how much of this growth is a function of share gains? Thanks.\nAndre Schulten: Good morning, Peter. Look, the Latin America business is on fire. And I think it is on fire because we've chosen maybe opposite to the market to double down on superiority. When we saw the need to price for foreign exchange and commodity impacts in Latin America, the team made the choice to double down on innovation and price for the innovation and to offset foreign exchange rate, inflation and commodities. And that clearly has played out well. We are seeing growth in our categories, and we are seeing share growth in Latin America. The growth is both on the volume side and on the value side in the biggest markets, in Brazil, Mexico, for example. I think the biggest headwind that we have to acknowledge is Argentina where it's very difficult to make progress at this point in time, given the level of inflation, some constraints in terms of ability to price. So outside of Argentina, I can only paint a very positive picture of the Latin America growth construction. And again, it's grounded in the superiority of our brands. And I feel very strong about the sustainability of that model.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks, and good morning everyone. Two sort of unrelated follow-ups. One, just on China. Given your commentary about the middle class, I think everybody's obviously aware that there's a growing middle class and that they'll ultimately consume more. But any sort of changes in your view about how quickly the middle class premiumizes purchases? Obviously, SK-II maybe sort of a one-off, but any changes there in terms of how quickly you think that they can go for more premium-priced products that potentially change how Procter thinks about its product positioning or portfolio positioning in the market? And then on the gross margin versus marketing spend sort of decision tree. If gross margin moderates, how do we think about the incremental reinvestment or marketing investment from an SG&A standpoint through the year? Would that inversely kind of move with gross margin? Or I should say, would it move with gross margin, meaning less gross margin expansion, less reinvestment? Thank you.\nAndre Schulten: Yep. Good morning, Mark. Look, I really don't have any more insights on the China recovery timing. You see the volatility in the market that will directly correlate with consumer confidence, income levels and therefore, recovery timing. I think we're hoping for faster, but we're prepared for longer would be my answer here. On the gross margin versus marketing spending side, we're -- when I say we're ROI driven, I really mean we are ROI driven. So there's no direct correlation between availability of funds and investment levels. If we continue to see strong response to the marketing spend, increases that we deliver in quarter one, I think there's a strong incentive for us to continue that level of investment. I also expect that our gross margin expansion and our overall growth contribution availability will continue to enable us to drive strong innovation and drive strong support of those innovations. That's part of the business model. That's why, again, it has to be a combination of driving very strong productivity to reinvest in superiority, to grow markets, and we have to keep that cycle spinning.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yes, thanks very much. Another strong quarter in the US, seeing both volume and value growth. Just looking back at 2020 where you were dealing with obviously a lot of COVID headwinds, you were talking about growing about 4% to 6% as a sustainable rate of growth in the US. In light of all that's gone on in the past few years and seeing where we are in the US at the moment with the consumer, are you still comfortable with that range over the longer term?\nAndre Schulten: Look, I won't give you guidance on a market-by-market basis. I think the -- what is proving out is that the business model we're driving in the US is very successful. If we are successful in continuing to drive market growth, that will continue to drive sales ahead of that market growth for us while being sustainable because we create business instead of taking business from somebody else. If that model is successful, which I believe it will, I feel very strongly about the growth prospects of the US. And again, we're doubling down in every dimension of superiority. We're doubling down in every dimension of market execution. So my overall confidence in the US market capability and growth trajectory is very high. Operator, are there any more questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nAndre Schulten: Okay. Thank you very much for joining us today. Again, very strong first quarter in the year and we look forward to speaking with you. If you have any questions, John and I will be available all day. So please feel free to call or e-mail. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andre Schulten",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This fiscal year, Jon Moeller, Chairman, President and CEO, will join the mid-year and year-end calls and I'll be leading the Q1 and Q3 calls. Execution of our integrated strategy draws strong results in the July to September quarter. Broad-based organic sales growth across categories and regions, global aggregate market share growth, strong productivity savings enabling increased investment in superiority of our brands while also delivering very strong earnings growth. These strong first quarter results put us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth and core earnings per share, and continued strong cash productivity and cash return to share owners. So moving to first quarter numbers, organic sales grew 7%. Pricing added 7 points to sales growth, and mixed contributed 1 point. Volume rounded down to a decline of 1 point with overall modest volume growth outside greater China. Top-line growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care grew low teens, personal healthcare was up double digits, feminine care, oral care, fabric care, hair care and grooming, each grew high single digits. Baby care and family care were up mid-singles, skin and personal care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies, with five of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 6% for the quarter, organic sales in the US were up 7% and Europe focus markets were up 15%. Greater China organic sales were down 6% versus prior year. Underlying market growth is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak. SK-II was down low teens in Greater China due to soft market conditions and a temporary reduction in social retail merchandising. Enterprise markets were up 13%, with Latin America up 19%, and Europe enterprise markets up 15%. Shipment volume in the US grew 3% again this quarter and we returned to volume growth in Europe focus markets. Mexico, Brazil and India, some of our largest enterprise markets, continue to deliver volume growth. These gains largely offset volume declines in the Greater China, Asia Pacific and European enterprise regions primarily driven by underlying market contraction. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 32 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was up 50 basis points versus prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing value share in the quarter. US volume share was up 60 basis points, reflecting 3% volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 40 basis points over the past three months. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.83, up 17% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 21%. Core operating margin increased 240 basis points, as 460 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation, and foreign exchange impacts on SG&A. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 340 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 210 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash for productivity was 97%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, a very good start to the fiscal year across top-line, bottom line, and cash. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past five years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value across each price tier we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in the volatile environment we're in. Finally an organization that is more empowered, agile, and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas, supply chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability, and the employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation, and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. Moving to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs, to currencies, to consumer and geopolitical dynamics. We attempt to reflect these realities in our guidance ranges. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal \u201824. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in July. However, within this estimate, there have been several moving parts. We've seen incremental relief on some commodities like pulp, which have been offset by higher costs than other commodities such as fuel. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us, and we now expect a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax, an incremental $600 million impact since our initial guidance for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits, and we expect higher year-on-year net interest expense of approximately $200 million after tax. As we are just one quarter into the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for organic sales, core EPS growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, with each solidly on track after a very strong first quarter. Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. The range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rate that is likely to occur through calendar year \u201824 as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth. For P&G, we expect 3 to 4 points less pricing benefit in each of the next two quarters compared to our first quarter results. On the bottom line, our outlook for fiscal \u201824 core earnings per share is 6% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. We're holding the range despite the incremental $600 million after-tax headwind from foreign exchange. With now a 7-point EPS impact from FX, this outlook translates to 13% to 16% core EPS growth on a constant-currency basis. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. As you consider the cadence of earnings for the year, keep in mind that the back half of the year will see less pricing benefit as we progressively annualize prior year increases. We should also see less commodity benefit as we move through the year. Labor inflation continues throughout the supply chain and [in our] (ph) costs. FX headwinds will increase versus quarter one. Also with a strong start to the year, we'll be reinvesting to further strengthen our plans and to maintain strong momentum. Finally, we'll be closely watching the health of the China market and the balance of regions, energy costs are rising as we head into fall and winter, household saving levels have reduced, especially in Europe. Slower economic growth, higher energy costs and higher interest rates for longer have an impact on consumer confidence. To conclude, while we expect volatile consumer and market dynamics to continue, we remain confident in our strategy and the results that it delivers. We are focused on driving growth in our categories and we are committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Good morning, Steve. We -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect the market to return to a lower, more sustainable growth rate more in line with historical growth at around 4%. That will have a stronger contribution on the volume side. We would expect that to be around 2% -- 1% to 2% of pricing and maybe a point of mix impact. That will occur over the next few quarters and as always, P&G is intending to grow ahead of the market. So really, our expectation for the year is to be slightly ahead of the market in terms of volume and slightly ahead in terms of price. We continue to believe that we can price with strong innovation. And we have gained even more confidence over the past two years that our strategy of pricing with innovation to drive superiority and create value for the consumer is working. And so we fully expect to return to that pattern. And again, pricing has been a core component of our growth for 18 out of the last 19 years, so we expect that to continue. Specifically, I think the pricing will start to lap in quarter two. So you will see probably the price contribution drop to -- by 3 to 4 points in quarter two, and that was expected. And we then sequentially expect volumes to pick up and offset part of that but do expect a lower overall market growth rate for the balance of the year. To your second part of the question, enterprise markets versus focus markets, I think the only differential would be foreign exchange. And we'll continue to price for foreign exchange. We've done that very successfully across the world. Turkey is a major example where we've been able to price for the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira, but we are able to grow share, grow sales, grow profit. We'll continue that model. Outside of that, we'll continue to do and drive the same business model we're driving in focus markets, innovate, drive superiority, price, grow markets and thereby grow sales, profit and share. Good morning, Dara. When you look at the total market, it's very consistent with previous periods. You still see average market growth of around 6% to 7%. And you see still the price component being a significant driver. Volumes are stabilizing at a global level. Minus a point to flat, depending on the geography. You look at the only exception being Greater China. So the price component and the price rollover is consistent period-over-period. So no differentiation there from a competitive standpoint, at least not that we see it. Promotion continues to be -- promotion levels and other indicator continue to be below pre-COVID levels. In the US, for example, volumes sold on deal is now at about 29%. Overall promotion level is still [indexed 80] (ph) versus pre-COVID. In Europe, we also see promotions still down and actually sequentially decreasing. Now it's a different dynamic by market, obviously, but when we aggregate up, it looks like over the past few quarters, promotion activity is actually still decreasing. And that makes sense. If you look at the relatively little or small help to commodity costs, we see about $800 million after-tax help offset by about $1 billion of foreign exchange. And recall, we're coming from two years, which combined have an impact of $7 billion of headwinds. So I think everybody is still recovering so the current pricing dynamic makes sense. We have not experienced retailer pushback beyond normal discussions on how to maximize value for their shoppers and for consumers overall. And again, our model of driving innovation and therefore, superiority and sales, while we price and create value for retailers and shoppers seems to be resonating. On the volume side, we feel very good about where we are in the trajectory of volume growth. Again, excluding China, we're already seeing volume growth of 20 basis points, sequential improvement in -- versus the prior quarters, which we would have expected. And again, that's in the context of 7% pricing still flowing into the market. We expect volumes will continue to grow. US strong. As we said, Europe, strong. Latin America and India are strong. So we continue to see us progressing on that trajectory. Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I think we said all along that we don't expect the China recovery to be quick, extensive or linear. And I think that's playing out. The business health in China is really all driven by market dynamics right now. So total market volume continues to be down. It has been down over the past few quarters between 7% and 9%. Value is down around 5% over the past few quarters, and that's the market I'm describing. So we're operating within a market that is still contracting post-COVID reopening. That said, we do believe that China continues to be an attractive place for us to do business. We've been there for 30 years. We have a very strong organization on the ground, R&D capability, supply chain capability and commercial capability. The Chinese consumer is a demanding consumer. The Chinese retail environment is a demanding retail environment and that generally plays to our strength. So we believe that, a, we can play a value-creating role in China, and we expect the Chinese market to return to mid-single-digit growth here over the coming periods. If you just look at the consumer structures, middle-income consumers, we have about 450 million, we estimate in China today. That will grow probably north of 700 million over the next five years. So there is a class of consumers that we believe are attractive for our businesses. And therefore, we believe that our business in China can create significant value over the next few years and we'll continue to remain invested. Yep. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Look, the European -- let me focus here on the Western European side because I think that's where your question is relevant. Look, we've seen 15% organic sales growth in Europe focus markets, which is incredibly strong, a combination of 2% volume growth and strong price/mix. We have 40 basis points of share growth across the same geographies that is returning to volume growth, and that generally are positive signs. Yes, private label shares in Europe are growing. They continue to grow at about an 80 basis point clip month-over-month. But that still enables us to grow share in the same geographies. And I think that share growth is enabled by a strong portfolio across different brand tiers, across different cash outlays. The fact that we are present in all relevant channels across Europe, and that allows us to effectively compete even as consumers look at the private label versus branded value creation, the balance seems to be still in our favor. Good morning, Bryan. If you look at the first quarter, I think the -- we are encouraged by the combination of factors here on the consumption side. Again, volume -- return to volume growth outside of China, we expect the China to be choppy as we said all along. But even with China down, we've been able to grow 7% and that certainly has been encouraging to us. And the depth and breadth of that growth, both across value and volume outside of China is really encouraging us and giving us confidence that the model will continue to drive results that point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. On the reinvestment side, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest when the return of that investment is attractive. It won't be driven by availability of funds. It will be driven by ability to create an attractive return. Our first priority, as you can imagine, in this current environment is to invest in ideas that drive market growth. So investing in products, investing in innovation that is driving new jobs to be done, investing in media spending that is driving household penetration, investing in communication to the consumer that drives usage in the right way to drive better delight for the consumer will be key. A couple of examples. Ninjamas in bedwetters was a sleepy category. We entered a couple of years ago. The category is growing 7%. We were able to drive 60% of that growth, which is six times our fair share. Those are great examples where we can continue to invest, drive growth for the business, drive growth for our retailers and create value for shareholders. We continue to see opportunities in media as we get sharper and sharper on our targeting across media around the world and our [capabilities are scaled] (ph). The ROI gets better. So we'll continue to drive up reach. We continue to drive up frequency. And again, that is a core driver for us to drive household penetration, drive trial, which will turn into loyalty and repeat. The last bucket I will give you is investing in supply, resilience and productivity. Our supply chain resilience, we see as a core competitive advantage for our retail partners and for ourselves. So we'll continue to ensure that our capacity to demand ratio is where we want it to be. And investing in productivity, we believe, has a high payout and is critical for us to continue the investment in superiority, which is part of the business model. So those are the headlines, but be reassured, we'll do it on a very disciplined basis with return on investment as the top priority. So first part -- good morning, Andrea. First part of your question, we obviously want to see SK-II return to growth but the volume impact of SK-II is relatively limited because the volume to organic sales ratio obviously is very high unit sales. So China, we believe, will return to mid-single-digit growth. When exactly that's going to happen is really hard to predict. And I would say, like we have delivered 7% organic sales growth in the first quarter with China down, I think we'll continue to operate, and not counting on China recovery as the core catalyst to growth for the coming quarters. On your sequential question on volume, you're right. As we said, the pricing contribution to organic sales growth will decrease 3 to 4 points over the coming quarters. And we expect volume to progress sequentially. The exact trajectory of that progression, I think, is questionable, and I won't make a prediction here. But I'll tell you that the progress we're seeing from minus 6% to minus 3% to flat -- to minus 1% to now flat, is pointing in that right direction. So we see we're on the right path, and we will continue to invest to drive wholesale penetration and create that volume growth in our business. Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. Good morning. Look, the consumer continues to be remarkably resilient. As we said in the US, the consumption levels are actually stable. Our volume share and our value share are growing. And that's true in Europe and in most parts of the world. And I interpret that as our portfolio doing exactly the job that it's supposed to do. And building a portfolio that is grounded in superiority in daily use categories that are nondiscretionary, I think, is serving us extremely well. We're able to add value, bring value to the consumer. And we are doing that in every tier, not just in the premium tier, but in the mid-tier and in value tiers across the world, which allows us to serve the consumer even as their spending preferences might change. Now, we haven't seen a significant change in their preference yet. If anything, consumers that are choosing P&G products continue to trade up within our portfolio. But you can see our ability to grow in markets even when we see private label shares expand. And so we don't expect a significant change in that profile. And we believe we are well set up to grow even if the consumer feels a bit of -- more of a pinch here going into the fall or winter season. The main intervention for us continues to be investing in innovation and continue to invest in media support to communicate the strength and the value that our brands can provide. We don't see a significant need to drive price promotion. Our focus, if we promote, if we look for in-store support is really to drive regimen. So we view it as a strategic tool to drive either trial or habit formation, i.e., regimen steps added to the laundry regime or the hair care regime, for example, because that drives incremental consumption, it drives growth for our retail partners and for us. In many cases, our innovation is strong enough to get in-store support, and that's really what we're after. When the product in and of itself generates enough traffic and consumption so retailers want to support it, that's the golden grade we're after. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good morning. The laundry business is very encouraging. Results around the world are very strong. Let me focus on the US market because that's -- it's the biggest market and you have the highest visibility to. But if you look at the trends, they are very encouraging. We are now growing value and volume share in US fabric care. Value share has been flat over the past three months. Volume share has been up 1.6 points. So we continue to push the laundry business forward. We have record high fabric enhancer shares and we have record high laundry consumption in the US. Most importantly, I think, is the fact that we're driving 70% of the category growth in laundry, and we're driving 100% of the category growth in fabric enhancers. And it's really driven by strong innovation, strong superiority and doubling down on consumer relevant communication and in-store support. So I fully believe that this will only accelerate. And to your question, yes, it is sustainable because it's just in line with the business model. PHC is doing extremely well around the world. And obviously, the seasonality here plays a key role. Going into the season, we see strong results, which is part of the strength in volumes that you see. And the last part I'll leave you with is we've invested significantly and continue to invest in strengthening our supply capability in personal healthcare, which will be needed to support that strong growth going forward. But feel good about both businesses. And yes, I think the trajectory is absolutely sustainable. Good morning, Filippo. Yeah, when we talked about the cadence of earnings, I think it's important to understand the drivers of the gross margin expansion we saw in quarter one. And we expect some normalization of gross margin. We were certainly benefiting from a high price contribution in quarter one. And as we said, that price contribution will ease over the coming quarters. The biggest part of the commodity help, about 33% of the $800 million after-tax commodity help has materialized in quarter one. So that's a positive to gross margin relative to the balance of the year. And the foreign exchange rate headwinds will accelerate over the coming quarters. On the other hand, we will accelerate and continue to drive strong productivity. We will continue to drive trade-up and innovation. And we continue to drive every other element of productivity, not only in gross margin, but across the P&L and the balance sheet. But I want you to take away that the gross margin expansion in quarter one is very strong, but we have headwinds going into the balance of the year. Good morning, Peter. Look, the Latin America business is on fire. And I think it is on fire because we've chosen maybe opposite to the market to double down on superiority. When we saw the need to price for foreign exchange and commodity impacts in Latin America, the team made the choice to double down on innovation and price for the innovation and to offset foreign exchange rate, inflation and commodities. And that clearly has played out well. We are seeing growth in our categories, and we are seeing share growth in Latin America. The growth is both on the volume side and on the value side in the biggest markets, in Brazil, Mexico, for example. I think the biggest headwind that we have to acknowledge is Argentina where it's very difficult to make progress at this point in time, given the level of inflation, some constraints in terms of ability to price. So outside of Argentina, I can only paint a very positive picture of the Latin America growth construction. And again, it's grounded in the superiority of our brands. And I feel very strong about the sustainability of that model. Yep. Good morning, Mark. Look, I really don't have any more insights on the China recovery timing. You see the volatility in the market that will directly correlate with consumer confidence, income levels and therefore, recovery timing. I think we're hoping for faster, but we're prepared for longer would be my answer here. On the gross margin versus marketing spending side, we're -- when I say we're ROI driven, I really mean we are ROI driven. So there's no direct correlation between availability of funds and investment levels. If we continue to see strong response to the marketing spend, increases that we deliver in quarter one, I think there's a strong incentive for us to continue that level of investment. I also expect that our gross margin expansion and our overall growth contribution availability will continue to enable us to drive strong innovation and drive strong support of those innovations. That's part of the business model. That's why, again, it has to be a combination of driving very strong productivity to reinvest in superiority, to grow markets, and we have to keep that cycle spinning. Look, I won't give you guidance on a market-by-market basis. I think the -- what is proving out is that the business model we're driving in the US is very successful. If we are successful in continuing to drive market growth, that will continue to drive sales ahead of that market growth for us while being sustainable because we create business instead of taking business from somebody else. If that model is successful, which I believe it will, I feel very strongly about the growth prospects of the US. And again, we're doubling down in every dimension of superiority. We're doubling down in every dimension of market execution. So my overall confidence in the US market capability and growth trajectory is very high. Operator, are there any more questions? Okay. Thank you very much for joining us today. Again, very strong first quarter in the year and we look forward to speaking with you. If you have any questions, John and I will be available all day. So please feel free to call or e-mail. Thank you very much."
