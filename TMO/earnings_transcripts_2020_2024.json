Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 fourth quarter call and a wrap up of what's been a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy as we all work to get beyond the pandemic. Before I cover many of the highlights from the quarter and the year, I want to share some news about our Investor Relations team. This will be Ken's last earnings call as he plans to retire at the end of March. You've all come to know Ken very well over the years. He's been leading the IR function since 2005 and is concluding a remarkable 25-year career at Thermo Fisher. Ken has been the voice of our company to the Street, and he excels in that role. He conveys his extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our opportunities in a way that's informative and engaging. In fact, you voted ken the best IR professional in our industry multiple times over the year. And I couldn't agree more. He's been a terrific partner to me and Stephen. Ken, thank you for a truly stellar contribution to Thermo Fisher. Looking ahead, we're very fortunate to have Raf Tejada here to take the reins in March. Raf has been a part of the Thermo Fisher Investor Relations team for five years, and many of you knew him during his time at Wall Street, most recently at Bank of America as an analyst supporting Derik de Bruin. I know Raf and the team will carry forward Ken's legacy of excellence and Investor Relations. Please join me congratulating Raf on his new role, and wishing Ken all the best in his well deserved retirement. So moving on to our results for 2020, an unprecedented year by any measure. I'm pleased to report that we delivered the strongest year in our company's history that speaks to the incredible work of our 80,000 colleagues around the world. Through their tireless efforts, we led the industry in supporting our customers globally, enabling the societal response to the pandemic. We delivered outstanding results by working with speed at scale to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs. This included generating $6.6 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, and quickly returning the base business to growth after the disruption seen across the globe earlier in 2020. The strength of our response activities allowed us to significantly accelerate investments in our company to create an even brighter future with a focus on talent, R&D and new capabilities and capacity. We also generated significant free cash flow during 2020. And we're good stewards of capital, creating shareholder value through share buybacks and dividends, building a strong M&A pipeline and reducing our net debt. I'll share some of the many highlights from the quarter and the year later in my remarks. But first, I'll cover the financials at a high level. Starting with the quarter, our revenue grew 54% in Q4 year-over-year to $10.55 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 107% to $3.51 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 840 basis points in Q4 to 33.3%. Finally adjusted EPS increased 100% to $7.09 per share in the quarter. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 26% to $32.22 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $9.56 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 630 basis points to 29.7%. And we delivered a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $19.55 per share. Both our fourth quarter and full year financial performance were truly exceptional on all metrics and demonstrate the strength of our growth strategy and our ability to move with speed at scale in responding to rapidly evolving customer needs.  Let me now turn to our end markets and give you some color on our performance for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance again in this end market delivering approximately 25% growth during Q4. We saw very robust growth across all businesses serving these customers, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel.  Our Q4 results capped off an excellent year of growth in the mid-teens. Our strong performance has been driven by our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  In academic and government we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter as customers across the globe ramped up activity. We saw good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly chromatography and mass spectrometry, and our research and safety market channel. Similarly, in industrial and applied, the team\u2019s strong execution helped us return this end market to growth in Q4. We grew in the low single-digits during the quarter and it was good to see our electron microscopy business return to growth.  Given the significant impact of the pandemic on customer activity earlier in 2020, both the academic and government, and the industrial and applied end markets declined in the mid single-digit growth for the full year.  Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had another incredible quarter delivering more than 200% growth. Our COVID-19 testing revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter as customer demand for our sample preparation, PCR solutions and viral transport media remained very robust. For the full year, diagnostics and healthcare grew by more than 100%, driven by our leading role in supporting COVID-19 testing around the world. Our outstanding performance was the result of having the right technologies and the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing which was enabled by our PPI Business System.  As I think back to this call a year ago, and how quickly conditions evolved during the year, I'm humbled by the incredible impact our team had in navigating the environment while supporting so many aspects of the pandemic response. As a reminder, early in the year, our cryo electron microscopes were used by researchers to create the first 3D image of the virus. We were a critical supplier of PPE leveraging our strong channel relationships to secure these products when supplies were scarce. We enabled COVID-19 testing at an unprecedented level, creating a market leading molecular diagnostics business in just a few months to support hundreds of millions of PCR tests around the world. And as you know, we've built trusted relationships with the pharma and biotech industry over many years, and have provided them with the right set of products and services.  As a result, these customers engage with us on a significant number of projects to help, develop and produce vaccines and therapies. In 2020 this led to $500 million in COVID-19 vaccine therapy revenue and we expect that to increase to $1 billion in 2021. Our comprehensive response to the pandemic demonstrates the unique capabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Now let me turn to a business update framed by our growth strategy and highlight just a few of our many achievements. As a reminder, there are three pillars to our growth strategy. First, we're committed to high impact innovation. Second, we leverage our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. And third, we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, it was an extraordinary year of high impact innovation. In response to the pandemic, we established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 testing. We quickly developed and gained regulatory approval to launch the TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit in March, providing gold standard PCR-based test for our customers at a scale our industry has never seen before. We also significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19-related products, including our Amplitude solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. In addition, we launched a number of highly innovative products across our base business to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, in mass spectrometry, we extended our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise with 2 new generation Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched 2 Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes. And in Q4, we introduced the Tundra cryo-electron microscope. And these are just some of the examples of how we're continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. Our actions in the region are a great example of how our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience we've created sets us up to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. In China, we further accelerated from our strong Q3 results, growing 30% in Q4. To continue to strengthen our presence in China and support the local biotech industry, during the year, we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. And in the quarter, we announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. Last, I want to touch on the third pillar of our strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Let me give you some examples. When the pandemic hit, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharma and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 vaccine -- related therapies and vaccines because of the trusted relationships we've built over many years. We moved quickly and invested significantly in our infrastructure, scaling up to support the volumes needed as well as adding capabilities for new modalities such as mRNA. The broad and fast response helped deepen our already strong customer relationships, and this positions us incredibly well to help them with their near-term COVID-19 needs as well as the longer-term needs for future vaccines and therapies for other diseases. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We've dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong a partner we are in addressing this -- their needs. Bringing this all together, we execute our proven growth strategy using our PPI business system that enables our teams to operate with speed at scale and was a key differentiator in our success last year. PPI is our operational discipline and enables us to translate the top-line growth into strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We entered 2020 with excellent long-term growth prospects as a company. The way we executed for our customers throughout the year further unlocked our growth potential, which will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Let me give you some color on the increased investments we were able to make because of our strong performance. In innovation, we ramped up our R&D investment by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. In emerging markets, we expanded our localized capacity and capabilities to further advance our leadership. And to enhance our unique customer value proposition, we invested significant CapEx in our high-growth bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences businesses as well as in commercial capabilities to further differentiate the customer experience. In total, last year, we invested an additional $1 billion to accelerate our long-term growth, roughly half in CapEx and half in P&L investments. These actions, combined with the substantial investments planned for 2021, will position our company for a very bright future. Turning now to capital deployment. We have a strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and we continued to execute our strategy in 2020. During the year, we returned a total of $1.8 billion in capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and a growing dividend. As you know, we announced several strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In our Pharma Services business, we entered into a strategic partnership with CSL to expand our biologics capacity for this rapidly growing market. We acquired Phitonex to enhance our flow cytometry offering for cell analysis. Shortly after year-end, we acquired the European viral vector manufacturing business from Novasep. And we signed an agreement to acquire Mesa Biotech to enhance our PCR-based diagnostics, adding gold standard technology in a rapid point-of-care testing format. We ended '21 -- 2021 with a very strong balance sheet, active and an active deal pipeline. As always, we'll continue to apply our disciplined approach to opportunities and continue to be good stewards of our capital. Before I turn to guidance, 2020 was also a significant year of progress in terms of environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on having a positive impact on the world. That's the true embodiment of our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll highlight a couple of the initiatives that are having a big social impact. One is that we launched and significantly funded the Thermo Fisher Foundation for science, expanding our STEM education programs to benefit underserved communities. Another is that we established the Just Project, a collaboration with historically black colleges and universities where we've invested in a COVID-19 testing program, allowing students and faculty to safely return to campus. I'm proud of these and the many steps our teams are taking to make a difference in our communities around the world. Taking a step back and reflecting on the year as a whole, by all measures, we delivered an outstanding year. Now looking ahead to 2021. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver $35.1 billion in 2021, which would result in reported revenue growth of 9%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $21.62 per share for the full year. That's 11% growth year-over-year and a continuation of our outstanding track record. Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. The success of our growth strategy clearly sets us apart as the unrivaled leader in our industry. 2020 truly demonstrated the power of who and what we are as a company. During a unique time of need, we stepped up for our customers, enabling their important contributions to society and helping them navigate the recessionary impact of the pandemic. As a result, we were able to gain significant market share and solidify Thermo Fisher as their partner of choice. At the same time, we stay focused on driving strong returns from existing investments and made additional investments to accelerate our future growth. While I'm very proud of our accomplishments during the past year, as I look ahead, I couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in 2021 and beyond. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we achieved an exceptional quarter and grew organically 51% in Q4. This resulted in full year organic growth of 25%. Similar to previous quarters, I'll break down the organic growth into 2 elements. The first is the performance of the base business and the second is the scale of the COVID-19 response revenue. In Q4, the base business grew 5% organically, another quarter of sequential improvement. For the full year, the base business was essentially flat as a result of slower economic activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic, partially offset by great commercial execution. Our COVID-19 response revenue also increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion, bringing the full year impact for our customers to $6.6 billion. This was largely driven by testing-related products and instruments. It is also worth noting that we generated $500 million of revenue in 2020 from support for COVID-19-related vaccines and therapies. Once again, our PPI Business System enabled excellent pull-through, and we delivered 100% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q4 and 58% for the full year. Our PPI Business System also enabled us to generate extremely strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $6.8 billion, up 67% versus the prior year. Overall exceptional financial results in 2020. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, starting with our Q4 earnings results. As I mentioned, we grew EPS -- adjusted EPS by 100% to $7.09. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $19.55, up 58% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $6.24, up 151% from Q4 last year. And 2020 full year GAAP EPS was $15.96, up 74% versus prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 54% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 51% organic growth and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange. For the full year 2020, reported revenue increased 26%. This includes a 25% contribution from organic growth and a 1% tailwind in foreign exchange. Turning to our growth by geographies. During the quarter, all regions delivered very strong growth. North America grew just over 65%; Europe grew approximately 50%; Asia Pacific grew approximately 20%, including China, which grew 30%; and rest of the world grew approximately 50%. For the full year, North America grew just over 30%, Europe grew over 25%, Asia Pacific grew 5% and rest of the world grew approximately 45%. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 107%; and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, 840 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 60% and adjusted operating margin was 29.7%, which is 630 basis points higher than 2019. In the quarter and for the full year, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage, and we also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments across all of our businesses to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 53.9%, up 760 basis points from Q4 of the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.2%, up 480 basis points versus prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the increase in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17% of revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points versus Q4 2019 due to the strong volume leverage. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.9% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to 2019. Total R&D expense was $376 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing growth of 44% and 18%, respectively, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $134 million, $37 million higher than Q4 last year, primarily due to higher level of debt. Net interest expense for the full year was $488 million, an increase of $37 million from 2019. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of approximately $3 million, $19 million lower than Q4 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $40 million, which was $32 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 430 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3% or 320 basis points higher than 2019. The increase in the tax rate was due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rate. Average diluted shares were 400 million in Q4, about 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the net impact of option dilution and share repurchases. For the full year, the average diluted shares were 399 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. We significantly increased net capital expenditure to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy while delivering a 67% increase in free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $8.3 billion, net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $6.8 billion. During 2020, we returned approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with approximately $10.3 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 17.9%, up 610 basis points from Q4 last year as we generated exceptional returns in 2020. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. And similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impacts that our COVID-19 response had on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions. There's revenue -- this is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab-developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. This segment also includes revenue from vaccine and therapy production supplies recognized in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses. The Specialty Diagnostics segment includes revenue in the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue for viral transport media in the microbiology business and for test and PPE in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue from vaccine and therapy services for our -- from our Pharma Services business. This segment also includes revenue for PPE in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by our lab products business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, and so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue increased 138% and organic revenue growth was 134%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business and biosciences and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, reported and organic revenue growth was 77%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 236%, and adjusted operating margin was 53.1%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix, and we continued to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 150% and adjusted operating margin was 50.2%, an increase of 15 percentage points over 2019. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 5%. End markets for chemical analysis remain muted, but this was more than offset by strong growth in both chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. We continued to see increased levels of customer activity in these businesses and drove strong commercial execution. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 7% and organic revenue decreased 8%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 580 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity that was more than offset by the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. We also had a headwind to margins from FX in this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 730 basis points versus prior year. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased by 109%. Organic revenue growth was 107%. Our COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The level of routine diagnostics testing activity was higher in Q4 than Q3, but still remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly for our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, reported revenue was 44% higher than the prior year and organic revenue growth was 48%. Adjusted operating income increased 134% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 47% and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus prior year. And finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 28%. Organic revenue growth was 25%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in all our businesses in this segment, the research and safety market channel, laboratory products and pharma services. For the full year, reported revenue was 16% higher than 2019 and organic revenue growth was 13%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 9.4%, which is 440 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, 210 basis points lower than the prior year. With that, I'll turn to our initial 2021 guidance. We're starting the year with annual guidance of 7% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $21.62, which will result in 11% growth over 2020. So another year of very strong financial performance. The dynamics around the pandemic continued to be fluid, but we thought it was important to give you our initial view of the full year, along with the associated assumptions to help frame how we're positioning the company for another successful year. We've chosen to go with a point outlook rather than a range because there are a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year, especially around testing. We remain incredibly well positioned to operate with speed at scale to uniquely serve our customers under any demand scenario that actually plays out this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest aggressively for very exciting near and long-term growth opportunities while delivering exceptional financial performance for shareholders. So just as we did in 2020, in 2021, we will maximize the opportunity to drive short and long-term value for all our stakeholders. Let me now provide you with the assumptions behind our initial guidance. In terms of revenue, our guidance is $35.1 billion, which represents approximately 9% reported growth over 2020, including 7% organic growth. There are 2 key elements to the organic growth assumption. First, the base business. Here, we're assuming 7% organic growth in 2021. The second element is the COVID-19 response. Here, we're starting the year with an assumption of $7.1 billion of revenue for 2021. This reflects testing-related revenue that's roughly the same as we delivered in 2020; plus approximately $1 billion of vaccine therapy-related revenue in 2021, which is double the level we generated last year. Let me give you some color on the phasing of the COVID-19 response revenue. We're assuming that vaccine and therapy revenue is fairly linear in 2021. The testing-related revenue is assumed to be very front-end loaded with Q1 levels similar to Q4 2020. Our guidance then assumes testing demand may begin to moderate in Q2 and potentially moderate further as the year progresses. Should the pandemic be longer lasting and the need for testing maintained, then this sizable upside to the $7.1 billion, particularly in the second half of the year. We're really well positioned to support our customers, should demand levels be higher than this initial guidance assumption. We'll have more clarity on the actual second half demand levels later in the year. With regards to FX, we're assuming a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.2% and $0.14 of adjusted EPS or 1%. We're assuming that acquisitions will contribute approximately $125 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021. The initial guidance assumes an adjusted operating margin of 29.8%, 10 basis points higher than last year. Our PPI Business System will continue to drive strong volume pull-through and productivity benefits, will be partially offset by significant strategic investments adding to those made in 2020 that Marc outlined earlier. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $470 million. This is $20 million lower than 2020 due to lower average net debt. It includes the impact of the $2.6 billion debt paydown that we completed in January. We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $8 million, lower by $32 million from 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. The improvement from our 14.3% prior year tax rate is primarily driven by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The midpoint represents an increased investment of $800 million over 2020, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and Laboratory Products businesses.  Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021. The increase over 2020 is primarily driven by expected earnings growth, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditure investments. Our guidance includes $2.8 billion of capital deployment. This consists of $1.5 billion of share buybacks, which we completed in January; $880 million for the recently completed acquisition of Novasep's European viral vector business; and it assumes approximately $400 million of capital returned to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 398 million shares, and our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. So it does not include the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which is expected to close later in Q1. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider. First, note that we have 3 extra selling days in Q1 and 4 fewer days in Q4 in 2021, resulting in 1 less day for the full year. Then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 response revenue included in the initial guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year. And as a reminder, the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of the year. So a lot of dynamics impacting the top-line growth by quarter, with very strong growth expected in the beginning of the year. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we're expecting approximately 54% of the year's total in the first half of the year and 46% in the second half, reflecting very strong operational execution throughout the year. And then from a near-term standpoint, taking into account all of these factors, we're expecting Q1 organic growth and operating margin, the profile of those to be similar to Q4 2020. So at a high level, we're starting the year with guidance of 7% organic revenue growth and 11% adjusted EPS growth, a continuation of our excellent long-term financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver for the best possible results, and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.\nKenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson : I'll start off by wishing Ken all the best, and great to work with you over the years. Marc, your implied testing drop off is steeper than we've heard from others like Hologic and [Abbott]. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about that dynamic in particular. Is that just a function of the non-automated PCR testing and maybe a lower installed base of the Amplitude? And then I'm curious about Mesa Bio, thoughts on increase -- entering an increasingly crowded point-of-care market. And are you planning to materially scale the antigen test? And how could that factor into the outlook?\nMarc Casper : Tycho, thanks for the question. Yes, I'm much more optimistic than the way you frame the question, right? So if I think about our PCR installed base and the assumptions, we have really strong line of sight to the first quarter, reasonable line of sight to the second quarter. And after that, our customers just don't know, right? So we made an assumption base that we're going to see incredibly strong demand in the first quarter. And that is going to drop off somewhat in Q2. And then we made a much more conservative assumption. But the way the pandemic has played out, there are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time. The truth is, this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world, and doctors are going to want to know whether or not a patient or a person has COVID, right? So I think you'll see as the year plays out, there's scenarios well above the testing assumption. Amplitude demand has been extraordinarily robust. Our installed base is growing, and that's been a nice adder to the growth that we saw in Q4 and the strong momentum we expect. Mesa is very exciting, right? When you think about what we've learned throughout the pandemic is that PCR testing is truly the gold standard. And the accuracy that you get is super relevant and Mesa's technology gets you a result in 30 minutes with PCR capability, and it gives you that confidence in the accuracy. And the way we think about it is there are a number of applications that are very relevant to have that rapid thing. Pharmacies would be an obvious example. The sports leagues have been using this technology. So those will be examples of where it is, and that obviously will be additive to our capabilities. It's not assumed in our guidance at this point. So thank you, Tycho.\nTycho Peterson : And then one follow-up for Stephen, just on the margins, understanding the 29.8% operating margin guidance. As we think about the gives and takes around the COVID tailwinds, can you maybe just talk as we think about COVID eventually wearing off, how much you expect to retain in terms of some of the margin uplift you've seen over the past year?\nStephen Williamson : Yes. So when I think about the margin profile that's embedded in this guide, as I mentioned, Q1 similar to Q4 of 2020 and then the other 3 quarters are roughly the same in terms of margin profile. It's a combination of kind of lost contribution from the testing revenue drop off and then the timing of investments. So that gives you an indication.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin : And I'll extend my congratulations to Ken and Raf. Stephen, I just wanted to sort of follow up on Tycho's comment there. I mean for most of -- I would say, for a lot of the end of 2020, a lot of the incoming calls from investors were, oh my God, Thermo has this huge COVID tailwind. It's going to create these really difficult comps. They're not going to be able to grow earnings. Obviously, that's not the case in 2021, but it sort of flips the question now over to 2022. And I realize it's too early and a certain extent to really answer that question given all the uncertainty. But I mean all of my incoming questions this morning from investors are, well, the guide for '21 looks great. What -- how do they think about 2022? And I just -- I don't know any initial thoughts on how you can talk about that or if you can talk about potential for earnings growth in 2022?\nMarc Casper : So Derik, I've been around the -- I've been around this one a while. I've never been at the next year's guidance on the opening one, but it's a great question and it's one that is a very fair one as well. So the way I think about it is the following: First, think about the way we've managed the company throughout 2020, right, which was drive very substantial growth in our financial performance, earnings cash flow while dramatically accelerating the reinvestment rate in the business, right? New opportunities were opened during the course of the year because of the pandemic, because of how we responded, because of the relationships we solidified and build. And we were able to put $1 billion of additional reinvestment in the business above the normal increases that we have every year. And we're stepping that up again in 2021. So what does that mean for the future? It means that the company is positioned to grow more rapidly. And that obviously will drive good earnings off of that increased kind of base business activity. And much of the investments that we made that are supporting COVID are going to be applied to other applications. So obviously, vaccines and therapies we expect will continue to be very relevant in 2022. But at some point, they'll be less relevant. And that capacity, that all converts over to non-COVID-related activities. On the molecular diagnostics side, the installed base increase in sample prep and the installed increase in QPCR creates the opportunity to build out an even larger molecular diagnostic business. We increased our installed base hugely during the course of the year. And more importantly, we satisfy customers. The reason that some of the others in this industry have relatively flat straight-through the year results for COVID is because they couldn't get manufacturing capacity up, right? We were able to do that in months. Others are talking about level-loaded demand that's because the supply has been so constrained with others. So we're excited about our prospects. And obviously, we'll see what the economy is, what the growth is, all of those things. And as it gets much closer to 2022, we'll figure it out. But I'm extremely bullish about the long-term prospects of the company.\nDerik de Bruin : Great. I know it's a lot of this, what have you done for me lately sort of conversations. But you already took my -- you already answered my molecular diagnostics question. So I just have one quick follow-up. And just to clarify, the CapEx step-up in '21 -- 2021, that we would expect those levels to sort of fall off in 2022 and beyond, right? That's not a new base level CapEx spending.\nMarc Casper : No, we would expect -- I think Stephen will add, we would expect it to start to wind back down over time. Obviously, if there are new opportunities that come up, obviously support them because we'll take the returns. But effectively, the step-up in 2020 and the further step-up in '21 really support the opportunities that materialize and the long-term acceleration of our growth.\nStephen Williamson : Yes. I think it's kind of a long, long-term modeling. It's really around about 3% to 3.5% of revenue is a good way to think about the profile of the company right now.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan : And also, congratulations, Ken; congrats, Raf. Well deserved. So wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit more. So around the assumption for vaccine therapeutic revenue fairly linear throughout the year, though we're obviously seeing the vaccine manufacturers scaling capacity into 2021. So could you just give a little bit more color around the framework behind the assumption? And are there any takes that you're assuming throughout the year?\nStephen Williamson : So I think one framing is we were at that run rate already in Q4. So this is kind of how we're seeing the year play out with a continuation of where we are. So a very high level of support for our customers. And then can you just clarify the last part of your question about the take?\nJack Meehan : Yes. Are there any projects that you think drop off throughout the year?\nMarc Casper: Yes. I mean there's always -- we obviously have supported a lot of development work of which some of those therapies or vaccines will be unsuccessful. So those projects conclude, but..\nJack Meehan : Embedded in that.\nMarc Casper: Embedded in the number, but obviously, the demand for the successful ones increase. So that kind of run rate we're at is not going to be the exact same products throughout the year. It ebbs and flows.\nJack Meehan : Great. And then I wanted to turn to analytical instruments. As you reflected over the last 6 months, can you -- versus the first 6 months of 2020, how do you think could be purchasing demand translated throughout the year? Could there have been some catch-up in the second half? And then maybe looking forward, how does -- what are your assumptions around that segment for 2021?\nMarc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the demand profile, obviously, there was very substantial disruptions both in customers' ability to order or even receive an instrument during the first part of the year, and obviously, all of the other challenges that the pandemic brought. We saw activity start to pick up at a much stronger level, particularly in material and structural analysis, which is largely our electronic microscopy business and our chrome and mass spec business. So Q4, we're strong in those regards. Chemical analysis is still soft, though the bookings did improve. So what I would expect is that you'll see continued strengthening this year, and that analytical instruments would grow above the company average. That's how I would think about it.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Doug Schenkel from Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel : Before I get into it, once again, Ken, best wishes on the next stage. You deserve all the best, and congrats to Raf. We have always enjoyed working with you both and look forward to working with you both. Well, at least Raf moving forward and hearing about what Ken is doing on the beach. So first topic is, again, on guidance. 2021 guidance assumes a base business growth rate of 7%. According to our math, this implies a 2-year stacked growth rate of around 3.5%, which is well below your longer-term growth rate target and also the Q4 core growth rate. How would you characterize the conservatism embedded into 2021 guidance? Or is this kind of balancing early in the year conservatism, which is typical for you with maybe just seeing some increased headwinds related to COVID-19 restrictions in certain parts of your business?\nMarc Casper : Yes, Doug. So when I think about the base business, I feel good about the implied step-up in growth that we saw from Q4 for the full year, right, going from roughly 5% growth in the fourth quarter to 7% growth in the base business for the full year. And what's assumed in there is still there's some level of disruption based on the pandemic. Let me just visualize it. Our Specialty Diagnostics business, routine doctor business are still well down, right? So there's parts of the business where you don't see that recovery for a while. But we still feel confident in growing at a good rate. And I see scenarios that are above the 7%, right? So it's not as if that's the only scenario that plays out. So I don't know if -- I think it's an appropriate start. I don't know if it's conservative or not, but we measure ourselves at the end of the year, did we do a great job? So we're going to look at how did everybody else in the industry report, and we need to make sure that we're gaining market share. And if the 7% reflects market share gains, then we're going to be satisfied. And if there's more opportunity to go faster than that, then you're going to see us deliver it.\nDoug Schenkel : Okay. That's helpful. And then let me just pivot to China. China growth rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. Actually, I -- we were looking back to our model over the years, and I think this represents the highest growth rate for at least the past decade in China on a quarterly basis. What drove the strength in China? Did you see some benefit of catch-up in spending? And then you made some comments in your prepared remarks, which prompted me to -- I guess prompted some curiosity about how your large molecule investments in China are actually impacting growth. And I guess the last part of this would be what's embedded for China growth in 2021?\nMarc Casper : Yes. So China, it was good to see, obviously, very disruptive first half of the year, 20%-ish organic growth in Q3 and 30% organic growth in Q4. So nice step-up, and Q4 was very strong. There was definitely some catch-up spend, right? I mean, obviously, customers getting back to work and all those things. So there was some of that in there. And that's pretty much impossible to quantify exactly what that is. But bookings were stronger than revenue growth, right? So we're excited about the growth prospects for China for this year, right? So China should be one of our fastest-growing geographies in 2021. So that would be the expectation. In terms of biologics and large molecule, we've talked about a lot on these calls over the years, the emergence of a local biotech industry for the Chinese market has become larger and larger over time. We've done a good job serving that customer base. I'm excited that we were able to localize our capacity for single-use technologies to support the local customer base and give them assurance of supply. And at the same point, we're very excited about the partnership and the joint venture reforming in Hangzhou to actually produce biologic drug substance and drug products. So we're well positioned there. And biotech is a nice driver of our growth. We also saw nice growth in other segments. Academic and government was quite strong in the quarter as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit of a flavor for what happened in China and what the strong outlook looks like.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore.\nVijay Kumar : Congrats to Ken and Raf. Marc, maybe a big picture question for you. Is there a view that the base business should be accelerating or perhaps has gotten stronger emerging from the pandemic? Some of the feedback we've been getting is higher installed base, biopharma accelerating. So perhaps some thoughts on what the base? I know the LRP pre-pandemic was 5 to 7. Is that LRP itself that math changing because the business is emerging more stronger from the pandemic?\nMarc Casper : Yes. So Vijay, thanks for the question. And yes, you've heard us talk about really starting in the Q3 call and the Analyst Meeting in September about how we're thinking about the longer term, right. And -- which goes back to the guiding principle that we have through the pandemic, which is make the decisions, investments and run the company to set ourselves up for a brighter future. We created new opportunities and new opportunities were created just in the market as well because of the pandemic. And when I think about that, we're positioning the company to exit the pandemic phase as a faster-growing company than what we grew, and the exact numbers will figure out over time. But the way I think about it is our -- the percent of our business in pharma and biotech continues to increase. That's our fastest-growing end market. So that's a market-driven weighted average type growth. But our value proposition, the increased investments in our innovation, the investments we're making in emerging markets, those things will all help us drive very strong growth going forward. So I'm very bullish about the long-term prospects for accelerated share gain into the long-term.\nVijay Kumar : That's helpful. And one perhaps on free cash flows. The guidance, $7 billion, that's sort of flattish to up slightly year-on-year. If I just look at your cap deployment assumptions for the year, it's about close to $3 billion-ish, considering you guys have $10 billion plus on the balance sheet plus the $7 billion you're generating. And I don't think Thermo has ever -- had 2 consecutive years of $10 billion plus of cash lying on the balance sheet. I'm curious why free cash perhaps -- why is it $7 billion? Any one-off items? And any thoughts on cap deployment?\nStephen Williamson : So Vijay, let me just clarify on the free cash flow. I think that includes a very significant increase in CapEx. So if you look about cash from operations, that's 13% growth year-over-year, which I think is incredibly strong and appropriately strong. And then we're choosing to deploy a large chunk of that towards these great opportunities in terms of CapEx. So that's kind of the -- get you to the $7 billion of free cash flow and the market in terms of capacity.\nMarc Casper : Yes. So we have had substantial capacity even when the company is more levered. And we've talked about that when we gave our 3-year models. We always have these numbers that are stagnantly large. We can deploy $30 billion wherever the numbers were historically back in '18 or '19 when we would talk about them. And when I think about where we are today, we have a lot of firepower. And you're seeing us be active right now with bolt-ons. We have a very busy pipeline, and we're going to be good stewards of capital. I mean we're going to be disciplined. We'll do the right things. We'll pass some of the things that we don't think are the right. It was good to get some return of capital already completed this year with $1.5 billion of buyback. So we don't look at the calendar and say, \"In any particular year, you have to do x or y.\" But I would expect us to be able to deploy that capital over time and be a nice adder to the strong financials that you're seeing in the initial guidance.\nKenneth Apicerno : Operator, we have time for one more.\nOperator: Okay. So your final question for today then will be from Dan Brennan from UBS.\nDan Brennan : Ken, obviously, have been great working with you and best of walk. The same thing with Raf, look forward to going forward. And Marc, a quick plug, things are looking up for our jets here. So I wanted to ask a first question on vaccine and therapeutics. I know you've addressed a few comments here thus far. I think on the last call, you discussed this $1 billion revenue cumulatively looking at 4Q '21 and '22. And I know to Derik's question, you addressed the outlook of some color on '22. I'm just wondering if you can help us think through kind of the durability. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces, but this $1 billion you're guiding for '21, presumably, there's going to be a pretty decent tail of this vaccine opportunity. Any way to help us think through that opportunity and how it breaks down between your tools business and [PPI]?\nMarc Casper : So Dan, thanks for the question, and the jets, not the best of years. But at least we were focused on a lot of things at Thermo Fisher. So I didn't suffer the pain too much. So when I think about vaccines and therapies, as you know, kind of our philosophy, which is articulate the numbers and the outlook on what you can see and don't create a lot of hype around things. So when we started out some months ago, we talked about $1 billion opportunity in total, right? That was contracted revenue that we saw. Obviously, as the pandemic continued, as our position continued, as we won more and more parts of the business, even what we committed to, if it all went to zero at the end of this upcoming year, it would be $1.5 billion because we did $0.5 billion last year, $1 billion this year. And based on what we see with the pandemic and what our customers are telling us, we would expect demand for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines to be very substantial in '22 and likely to have some level of revenue going into '23 and maybe even longer. So it's going to be a large contribution based on the strength of our bioproduction business and our pharma services capability. So thank you for the question. \nMarc Casper: Let me wrap here with a few things. First, as all of our analysts expressed and on behalf of all 80,000 colleagues, Ken, thank you for a job incredibly well done and wishing you the happiest of retirements. It's been awesome. From a company perspective, we delivered an exceptional year and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We're looking forward to updating you during the course of 2021. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we achieved an exceptional quarter and grew organically 51% in Q4. This resulted in full year organic growth of 25%. Similar to previous quarters, I'll break down the organic growth into 2 elements. The first is the performance of the base business and the second is the scale of the COVID-19 response revenue. In Q4, the base business grew 5% organically, another quarter of sequential improvement. For the full year, the base business was essentially flat as a result of slower economic activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic, partially offset by great commercial execution. Our COVID-19 response revenue also increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion, bringing the full year impact for our customers to $6.6 billion. This was largely driven by testing-related products and instruments. It is also worth noting that we generated $500 million of revenue in 2020 from support for COVID-19-related vaccines and therapies. Once again, our PPI Business System enabled excellent pull-through, and we delivered 100% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q4 and 58% for the full year. Our PPI Business System also enabled us to generate extremely strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $6.8 billion, up 67% versus the prior year. Overall exceptional financial results in 2020. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, starting with our Q4 earnings results. As I mentioned, we grew EPS -- adjusted EPS by 100% to $7.09. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $19.55, up 58% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $6.24, up 151% from Q4 last year. And 2020 full year GAAP EPS was $15.96, up 74% versus prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 54% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 51% organic growth and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange. For the full year 2020, reported revenue increased 26%. This includes a 25% contribution from organic growth and a 1% tailwind in foreign exchange. Turning to our growth by geographies. During the quarter, all regions delivered very strong growth. North America grew just over 65%; Europe grew approximately 50%; Asia Pacific grew approximately 20%, including China, which grew 30%; and rest of the world grew approximately 50%. For the full year, North America grew just over 30%, Europe grew over 25%, Asia Pacific grew 5% and rest of the world grew approximately 45%. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 107%; and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, 840 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 60% and adjusted operating margin was 29.7%, which is 630 basis points higher than 2019. In the quarter and for the full year, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage, and we also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments across all of our businesses to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 53.9%, up 760 basis points from Q4 of the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.2%, up 480 basis points versus prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the increase in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17% of revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points versus Q4 2019 due to the strong volume leverage. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.9% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to 2019. Total R&D expense was $376 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing growth of 44% and 18%, respectively, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $134 million, $37 million higher than Q4 last year, primarily due to higher level of debt. Net interest expense for the full year was $488 million, an increase of $37 million from 2019. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of approximately $3 million, $19 million lower than Q4 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $40 million, which was $32 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 430 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3% or 320 basis points higher than 2019. The increase in the tax rate was due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rate. Average diluted shares were 400 million in Q4, about 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the net impact of option dilution and share repurchases. For the full year, the average diluted shares were 399 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. We significantly increased net capital expenditure to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy while delivering a 67% increase in free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $8.3 billion, net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $6.8 billion. During 2020, we returned approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with approximately $10.3 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 17.9%, up 610 basis points from Q4 last year as we generated exceptional returns in 2020. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. And similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impacts that our COVID-19 response had on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions. There's revenue -- this is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab-developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. This segment also includes revenue from vaccine and therapy production supplies recognized in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses. The Specialty Diagnostics segment includes revenue in the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue for viral transport media in the microbiology business and for test and PPE in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue from vaccine and therapy services for our -- from our Pharma Services business. This segment also includes revenue for PPE in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by our lab products business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, and so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue increased 138% and organic revenue growth was 134%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business and biosciences and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, reported and organic revenue growth was 77%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 236%, and adjusted operating margin was 53.1%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix, and we continued to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 150% and adjusted operating margin was 50.2%, an increase of 15 percentage points over 2019. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 5%. End markets for chemical analysis remain muted, but this was more than offset by strong growth in both chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. We continued to see increased levels of customer activity in these businesses and drove strong commercial execution. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 7% and organic revenue decreased 8%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 580 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity that was more than offset by the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. We also had a headwind to margins from FX in this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 730 basis points versus prior year. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased by 109%. Organic revenue growth was 107%. Our COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The level of routine diagnostics testing activity was higher in Q4 than Q3, but still remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly for our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, reported revenue was 44% higher than the prior year and organic revenue growth was 48%. Adjusted operating income increased 134% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 47% and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus prior year. And finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 28%. Organic revenue growth was 25%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in all our businesses in this segment, the research and safety market channel, laboratory products and pharma services. For the full year, reported revenue was 16% higher than 2019 and organic revenue growth was 13%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 9.4%, which is 440 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, 210 basis points lower than the prior year. With that, I'll turn to our initial 2021 guidance. We're starting the year with annual guidance of 7% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $21.62, which will result in 11% growth over 2020. So another year of very strong financial performance. The dynamics around the pandemic continued to be fluid, but we thought it was important to give you our initial view of the full year, along with the associated assumptions to help frame how we're positioning the company for another successful year. We've chosen to go with a point outlook rather than a range because there are a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year, especially around testing. We remain incredibly well positioned to operate with speed at scale to uniquely serve our customers under any demand scenario that actually plays out this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest aggressively for very exciting near and long-term growth opportunities while delivering exceptional financial performance for shareholders. So just as we did in 2020, in 2021, we will maximize the opportunity to drive short and long-term value for all our stakeholders. Let me now provide you with the assumptions behind our initial guidance. In terms of revenue, our guidance is $35.1 billion, which represents approximately 9% reported growth over 2020, including 7% organic growth. There are 2 key elements to the organic growth assumption. First, the base business. Here, we're assuming 7% organic growth in 2021. The second element is the COVID-19 response. Here, we're starting the year with an assumption of $7.1 billion of revenue for 2021. This reflects testing-related revenue that's roughly the same as we delivered in 2020; plus approximately $1 billion of vaccine therapy-related revenue in 2021, which is double the level we generated last year. Let me give you some color on the phasing of the COVID-19 response revenue. We're assuming that vaccine and therapy revenue is fairly linear in 2021. The testing-related revenue is assumed to be very front-end loaded with Q1 levels similar to Q4 2020. Our guidance then assumes testing demand may begin to moderate in Q2 and potentially moderate further as the year progresses. Should the pandemic be longer lasting and the need for testing maintained, then this sizable upside to the $7.1 billion, particularly in the second half of the year. We're really well positioned to support our customers, should demand levels be higher than this initial guidance assumption. We'll have more clarity on the actual second half demand levels later in the year. With regards to FX, we're assuming a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.2% and $0.14 of adjusted EPS or 1%. We're assuming that acquisitions will contribute approximately $125 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021. The initial guidance assumes an adjusted operating margin of 29.8%, 10 basis points higher than last year. Our PPI Business System will continue to drive strong volume pull-through and productivity benefits, will be partially offset by significant strategic investments adding to those made in 2020 that Marc outlined earlier. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $470 million. This is $20 million lower than 2020 due to lower average net debt. It includes the impact of the $2.6 billion debt paydown that we completed in January. We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $8 million, lower by $32 million from 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. The improvement from our 14.3% prior year tax rate is primarily driven by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The midpoint represents an increased investment of $800 million over 2020, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and Laboratory Products businesses.  Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021. The increase over 2020 is primarily driven by expected earnings growth, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditure investments. Our guidance includes $2.8 billion of capital deployment. This consists of $1.5 billion of share buybacks, which we completed in January; $880 million for the recently completed acquisition of Novasep's European viral vector business; and it assumes approximately $400 million of capital returned to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 398 million shares, and our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. So it does not include the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which is expected to close later in Q1. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider. First, note that we have 3 extra selling days in Q1 and 4 fewer days in Q4 in 2021, resulting in 1 less day for the full year. Then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 response revenue included in the initial guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year. And as a reminder, the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of the year. So a lot of dynamics impacting the top-line growth by quarter, with very strong growth expected in the beginning of the year. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we're expecting approximately 54% of the year's total in the first half of the year and 46% in the second half, reflecting very strong operational execution throughout the year. And then from a near-term standpoint, taking into account all of these factors, we're expecting Q1 organic growth and operating margin, the profile of those to be similar to Q4 2020. So at a high level, we're starting the year with guidance of 7% organic revenue growth and 11% adjusted EPS growth, a continuation of our excellent long-term financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver for the best possible results, and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Yes. So when I think about the margin profile that's embedded in this guide, as I mentioned, Q1 similar to Q4 of 2020 and then the other 3 quarters are roughly the same in terms of margin profile. It's a combination of kind of lost contribution from the testing revenue drop off and then the timing of investments. So that gives you an indication. Yes. I think it's kind of a long, long-term modeling. It's really around about 3% to 3.5% of revenue is a good way to think about the profile of the company right now. So I think one framing is we were at that run rate already in Q4. So this is kind of how we're seeing the year play out with a continuation of where we are. So a very high level of support for our customers. And then can you just clarify the last part of your question about the take? So Vijay, let me just clarify on the free cash flow. I think that includes a very significant increase in CapEx. So if you look about cash from operations, that's 13% growth year-over-year, which I think is incredibly strong and appropriately strong. And then we're choosing to deploy a large chunk of that towards these great opportunities in terms of CapEx. So that's kind of the -- get you to the $7 billion of free cash flow and the market in terms of capacity."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 fourth quarter call and a wrap up of what's been a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy as we all work to get beyond the pandemic. Before I cover many of the highlights from the quarter and the year, I want to share some news about our Investor Relations team. This will be Ken's last earnings call as he plans to retire at the end of March. You've all come to know Ken very well over the years. He's been leading the IR function since 2005 and is concluding a remarkable 25-year career at Thermo Fisher. Ken has been the voice of our company to the Street, and he excels in that role. He conveys his extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our opportunities in a way that's informative and engaging. In fact, you voted ken the best IR professional in our industry multiple times over the year. And I couldn't agree more. He's been a terrific partner to me and Stephen. Ken, thank you for a truly stellar contribution to Thermo Fisher. Looking ahead, we're very fortunate to have Raf Tejada here to take the reins in March. Raf has been a part of the Thermo Fisher Investor Relations team for five years, and many of you knew him during his time at Wall Street, most recently at Bank of America as an analyst supporting Derik de Bruin. I know Raf and the team will carry forward Ken's legacy of excellence and Investor Relations. Please join me congratulating Raf on his new role, and wishing Ken all the best in his well deserved retirement. So moving on to our results for 2020, an unprecedented year by any measure. I'm pleased to report that we delivered the strongest year in our company's history that speaks to the incredible work of our 80,000 colleagues around the world. Through their tireless efforts, we led the industry in supporting our customers globally, enabling the societal response to the pandemic. We delivered outstanding results by working with speed at scale to meet our customers' evolving needs. This included generating $6.6 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, and quickly returning the base business to growth after the disruption seen across the globe earlier in 2020. The strength of our response activities allowed us to significantly accelerate investments in our company to create an even brighter future with a focus on talent, R&D and new capabilities and capacity. We also generated significant free cash flow during 2020. And we're good stewards of capital, creating shareholder value through share buybacks and dividends, building a strong M&A pipeline and reducing our net debt. I'll share some of the many highlights from the quarter and the year later in my remarks. But first, I'll cover the financials at a high level. Starting with the quarter, our revenue grew 54% in Q4 year-over-year to $10.55 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 107% to $3.51 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 840 basis points in Q4 to 33.3%. Finally adjusted EPS increased 100% to $7.09 per share in the quarter. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 26% to $32.22 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $9.56 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 630 basis points to 29.7%. And we delivered a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $19.55 per share. Both our fourth quarter and full year financial performance were truly exceptional on all metrics and demonstrate the strength of our growth strategy and our ability to move with speed at scale in responding to rapidly evolving customer needs.  Let me now turn to our end markets and give you some color on our performance for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance again in this end market delivering approximately 25% growth during Q4. We saw very robust growth across all businesses serving these customers, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel.  Our Q4 results capped off an excellent year of growth in the mid-teens. Our strong performance has been driven by our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  In academic and government we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter as customers across the globe ramped up activity. We saw good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly chromatography and mass spectrometry, and our research and safety market channel. Similarly, in industrial and applied, the team's strong execution helped us return this end market to growth in Q4. We grew in the low single-digits during the quarter and it was good to see our electron microscopy business return to growth.  Given the significant impact of the pandemic on customer activity earlier in 2020, both the academic and government, and the industrial and applied end markets declined in the mid single-digit growth for the full year.  Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had another incredible quarter delivering more than 200% growth. Our COVID-19 testing revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter as customer demand for our sample preparation, PCR solutions and viral transport media remained very robust. For the full year, diagnostics and healthcare grew by more than 100%, driven by our leading role in supporting COVID-19 testing around the world. Our outstanding performance was the result of having the right technologies and the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing which was enabled by our PPI Business System.  As I think back to this call a year ago, and how quickly conditions evolved during the year, I'm humbled by the incredible impact our team had in navigating the environment while supporting so many aspects of the pandemic response. As a reminder, early in the year, our cryo electron microscopes were used by researchers to create the first 3D image of the virus. We were a critical supplier of PPE leveraging our strong channel relationships to secure these products when supplies were scarce. We enabled COVID-19 testing at an unprecedented level, creating a market leading molecular diagnostics business in just a few months to support hundreds of millions of PCR tests around the world. And as you know, we've built trusted relationships with the pharma and biotech industry over many years, and have provided them with the right set of products and services.  As a result, these customers engage with us on a significant number of projects to help, develop and produce vaccines and therapies. In 2020 this led to $500 million in COVID-19 vaccine therapy revenue and we expect that to increase to $1 billion in 2021. Our comprehensive response to the pandemic demonstrates the unique capabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Now let me turn to a business update framed by our growth strategy and highlight just a few of our many achievements. As a reminder, there are three pillars to our growth strategy. First, we're committed to high impact innovation. Second, we leverage our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. And third, we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, it was an extraordinary year of high impact innovation. In response to the pandemic, we established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 testing. We quickly developed and gained regulatory approval to launch the TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit in March, providing gold standard PCR-based test for our customers at a scale our industry has never seen before. We also significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19-related products, including our Amplitude solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. In addition, we launched a number of highly innovative products across our base business to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, in mass spectrometry, we extended our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise with 2 new generation Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched 2 Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes. And in Q4, we introduced the Tundra cryo-electron microscope. And these are just some of the examples of how we're continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. Our actions in the region are a great example of how our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience we've created sets us up to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. In China, we further accelerated from our strong Q3 results, growing 30% in Q4. To continue to strengthen our presence in China and support the local biotech industry, during the year, we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. And in the quarter, we announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. Last, I want to touch on the third pillar of our strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Let me give you some examples. When the pandemic hit, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharma and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 vaccine -- related therapies and vaccines because of the trusted relationships we've built over many years. We moved quickly and invested significantly in our infrastructure, scaling up to support the volumes needed as well as adding capabilities for new modalities such as mRNA. The broad and fast response helped deepen our already strong customer relationships, and this positions us incredibly well to help them with their near-term COVID-19 needs as well as the longer-term needs for future vaccines and therapies for other diseases. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We've dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong a partner we are in addressing this -- their needs. Bringing this all together, we execute our proven growth strategy using our PPI business system that enables our teams to operate with speed at scale and was a key differentiator in our success last year. PPI is our operational discipline and enables us to translate the top-line growth into strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We entered 2020 with excellent long-term growth prospects as a company. The way we executed for our customers throughout the year further unlocked our growth potential, which will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Let me give you some color on the increased investments we were able to make because of our strong performance. In innovation, we ramped up our R&D investment by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. In emerging markets, we expanded our localized capacity and capabilities to further advance our leadership. And to enhance our unique customer value proposition, we invested significant CapEx in our high-growth bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences businesses as well as in commercial capabilities to further differentiate the customer experience. In total, last year, we invested an additional $1 billion to accelerate our long-term growth, roughly half in CapEx and half in P&L investments. These actions, combined with the substantial investments planned for 2021, will position our company for a very bright future. Turning now to capital deployment. We have a strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and we continued to execute our strategy in 2020. During the year, we returned a total of $1.8 billion in capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and a growing dividend. As you know, we announced several strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In our Pharma Services business, we entered into a strategic partnership with CSL to expand our biologics capacity for this rapidly growing market. We acquired Phitonex to enhance our flow cytometry offering for cell analysis. Shortly after year-end, we acquired the European viral vector manufacturing business from Novasep. And we signed an agreement to acquire Mesa Biotech to enhance our PCR-based diagnostics, adding gold standard technology in a rapid point-of-care testing format. We ended '21 -- 2021 with a very strong balance sheet, active and an active deal pipeline. As always, we'll continue to apply our disciplined approach to opportunities and continue to be good stewards of our capital. Before I turn to guidance, 2020 was also a significant year of progress in terms of environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on having a positive impact on the world. That's the true embodiment of our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll highlight a couple of the initiatives that are having a big social impact. One is that we launched and significantly funded the Thermo Fisher Foundation for science, expanding our STEM education programs to benefit underserved communities. Another is that we established the Just Project, a collaboration with historically black colleges and universities where we've invested in a COVID-19 testing program, allowing students and faculty to safely return to campus. I'm proud of these and the many steps our teams are taking to make a difference in our communities around the world. Taking a step back and reflecting on the year as a whole, by all measures, we delivered an outstanding year. Now looking ahead to 2021. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver $35.1 billion in 2021, which would result in reported revenue growth of 9%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $21.62 per share for the full year. That's 11% growth year-over-year and a continuation of our outstanding track record. Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. The success of our growth strategy clearly sets us apart as the unrivaled leader in our industry. 2020 truly demonstrated the power of who and what we are as a company. During a unique time of need, we stepped up for our customers, enabling their important contributions to society and helping them navigate the recessionary impact of the pandemic. As a result, we were able to gain significant market share and solidify Thermo Fisher as their partner of choice. At the same time, we stay focused on driving strong returns from existing investments and made additional investments to accelerate our future growth. While I'm very proud of our accomplishments during the past year, as I look ahead, I couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in 2021 and beyond. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Tycho, thanks for the question. Yes, I'm much more optimistic than the way you frame the question, right? So if I think about our PCR installed base and the assumptions, we have really strong line of sight to the first quarter, reasonable line of sight to the second quarter. And after that, our customers just don't know, right? So we made an assumption base that we're going to see incredibly strong demand in the first quarter. And that is going to drop off somewhat in Q2. And then we made a much more conservative assumption. But the way the pandemic has played out, there are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time. The truth is, this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world, and doctors are going to want to know whether or not a patient or a person has COVID, right? So I think you'll see as the year plays out, there's scenarios well above the testing assumption. Amplitude demand has been extraordinarily robust. Our installed base is growing, and that's been a nice adder to the growth that we saw in Q4 and the strong momentum we expect. Mesa is very exciting, right? When you think about what we've learned throughout the pandemic is that PCR testing is truly the gold standard. And the accuracy that you get is super relevant and Mesa's technology gets you a result in 30 minutes with PCR capability, and it gives you that confidence in the accuracy. And the way we think about it is there are a number of applications that are very relevant to have that rapid thing. Pharmacies would be an obvious example. The sports leagues have been using this technology. So those will be examples of where it is, and that obviously will be additive to our capabilities. It's not assumed in our guidance at this point. So thank you, Tycho. So Derik, I've been around the -- I've been around this one a while. I've never been at the next year's guidance on the opening one, but it's a great question and it's one that is a very fair one as well. So the way I think about it is the following: First, think about the way we've managed the company throughout 2020, right, which was drive very substantial growth in our financial performance, earnings cash flow while dramatically accelerating the reinvestment rate in the business, right? New opportunities were opened during the course of the year because of the pandemic, because of how we responded, because of the relationships we solidified and build. And we were able to put $1 billion of additional reinvestment in the business above the normal increases that we have every year. And we're stepping that up again in 2021. So what does that mean for the future? It means that the company is positioned to grow more rapidly. And that obviously will drive good earnings off of that increased kind of base business activity. And much of the investments that we made that are supporting COVID are going to be applied to other applications. So obviously, vaccines and therapies we expect will continue to be very relevant in 2022. But at some point, they'll be less relevant. And that capacity, that all converts over to non-COVID-related activities. On the molecular diagnostics side, the installed base increase in sample prep and the installed increase in QPCR creates the opportunity to build out an even larger molecular diagnostic business. We increased our installed base hugely during the course of the year. And more importantly, we satisfy customers. The reason that some of the others in this industry have relatively flat straight-through the year results for COVID is because they couldn't get manufacturing capacity up, right? We were able to do that in months. Others are talking about level-loaded demand that's because the supply has been so constrained with others. So we're excited about our prospects. And obviously, we'll see what the economy is, what the growth is, all of those things. And as it gets much closer to 2022, we'll figure it out. But I'm extremely bullish about the long-term prospects of the company. No, we would expect -- I think Stephen will add, we would expect it to start to wind back down over time. Obviously, if there are new opportunities that come up, obviously support them because we'll take the returns. But effectively, the step-up in 2020 and the further step-up in '21 really support the opportunities that materialize and the long-term acceleration of our growth. Yes. I mean there's always -- we obviously have supported a lot of development work of which some of those therapies or vaccines will be unsuccessful. So those projects conclude, but.. Embedded in the number, but obviously, the demand for the successful ones increase. So that kind of run rate we're at is not going to be the exact same products throughout the year. It ebbs and flows. Yes. So in terms of the demand profile, obviously, there was very substantial disruptions both in customers' ability to order or even receive an instrument during the first part of the year, and obviously, all of the other challenges that the pandemic brought. We saw activity start to pick up at a much stronger level, particularly in material and structural analysis, which is largely our electronic microscopy business and our chrome and mass spec business. So Q4, we're strong in those regards. Chemical analysis is still soft, though the bookings did improve. So what I would expect is that you'll see continued strengthening this year, and that analytical instruments would grow above the company average. That's how I would think about it. Yes, Doug. So when I think about the base business, I feel good about the implied step-up in growth that we saw from Q4 for the full year, right, going from roughly 5% growth in the fourth quarter to 7% growth in the base business for the full year. And what's assumed in there is still there's some level of disruption based on the pandemic. Let me just visualize it. Our Specialty Diagnostics business, routine doctor business are still well down, right? So there's parts of the business where you don't see that recovery for a while. But we still feel confident in growing at a good rate. And I see scenarios that are above the 7%, right? So it's not as if that's the only scenario that plays out. So I don't know if -- I think it's an appropriate start. I don't know if it's conservative or not, but we measure ourselves at the end of the year, did we do a great job? So we're going to look at how did everybody else in the industry report, and we need to make sure that we're gaining market share. And if the 7% reflects market share gains, then we're going to be satisfied. And if there's more opportunity to go faster than that, then you're going to see us deliver it. Yes. So China, it was good to see, obviously, very disruptive first half of the year, 20%-ish organic growth in Q3 and 30% organic growth in Q4. So nice step-up, and Q4 was very strong. There was definitely some catch-up spend, right? I mean, obviously, customers getting back to work and all those things. So there was some of that in there. And that's pretty much impossible to quantify exactly what that is. But bookings were stronger than revenue growth, right? So we're excited about the growth prospects for China for this year, right? So China should be one of our fastest-growing geographies in 2021. So that would be the expectation. In terms of biologics and large molecule, we've talked about a lot on these calls over the years, the emergence of a local biotech industry for the Chinese market has become larger and larger over time. We've done a good job serving that customer base. I'm excited that we were able to localize our capacity for single-use technologies to support the local customer base and give them assurance of supply. And at the same point, we're very excited about the partnership and the joint venture reforming in Hangzhou to actually produce biologic drug substance and drug products. So we're well positioned there. And biotech is a nice driver of our growth. We also saw nice growth in other segments. Academic and government was quite strong in the quarter as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit of a flavor for what happened in China and what the strong outlook looks like. Yes. So Vijay, thanks for the question. And yes, you've heard us talk about really starting in the Q3 call and the Analyst Meeting in September about how we're thinking about the longer term, right. And -- which goes back to the guiding principle that we have through the pandemic, which is make the decisions, investments and run the company to set ourselves up for a brighter future. We created new opportunities and new opportunities were created just in the market as well because of the pandemic. And when I think about that, we're positioning the company to exit the pandemic phase as a faster-growing company than what we grew, and the exact numbers will figure out over time. But the way I think about it is our -- the percent of our business in pharma and biotech continues to increase. That's our fastest-growing end market. So that's a market-driven weighted average type growth. But our value proposition, the increased investments in our innovation, the investments we're making in emerging markets, those things will all help us drive very strong growth going forward. So I'm very bullish about the long-term prospects for accelerated share gain into the long-term. Yes. So we have had substantial capacity even when the company is more levered. And we've talked about that when we gave our 3-year models. We always have these numbers that are stagnantly large. We can deploy $30 billion wherever the numbers were historically back in '18 or '19 when we would talk about them. And when I think about where we are today, we have a lot of firepower. And you're seeing us be active right now with bolt-ons. We have a very busy pipeline, and we're going to be good stewards of capital. I mean we're going to be disciplined. We'll do the right things. We'll pass some of the things that we don't think are the right. It was good to get some return of capital already completed this year with $1.5 billion of buyback. So we don't look at the calendar and say, \"In any particular year, you have to do x or y.\" But I would expect us to be able to deploy that capital over time and be a nice adder to the strong financials that you're seeing in the initial guidance. So Dan, thanks for the question, and the jets, not the best of years. But at least we were focused on a lot of things at Thermo Fisher. So I didn't suffer the pain too much. So when I think about vaccines and therapies, as you know, kind of our philosophy, which is articulate the numbers and the outlook on what you can see and don't create a lot of hype around things. So when we started out some months ago, we talked about $1 billion opportunity in total, right? That was contracted revenue that we saw. Obviously, as the pandemic continued, as our position continued, as we won more and more parts of the business, even what we committed to, if it all went to zero at the end of this upcoming year, it would be $1.5 billion because we did $0.5 billion last year, $1 billion this year. And based on what we see with the pandemic and what our customers are telling us, we would expect demand for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines to be very substantial in '22 and likely to have some level of revenue going into '23 and maybe even longer. So it's going to be a large contribution based on the strength of our bioproduction business and our pharma services capability. So thank you for the question. Let me wrap here with a few things. First, as all of our analysts expressed and on behalf of all 80,000 colleagues, Ken, thank you for a job incredibly well done and wishing you the happiest of retirements. It's been awesome. From a company perspective, we delivered an exceptional year and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We're looking forward to updating you during the course of 2021. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone."

So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered exceptional performance again in Q3 as we continue to build on the significant progress we made last quarter. I continue to be humbled by the incredible efforts of our team as they answer the call to help our customers and society manage through this unprecedented time. Not only did they expand our leading role in supporting the Global COVID-19 response, but they also effectively managed through this environment to return our base business to growth. The work we're doing today is clearly having a profound impact on the world, and for that we can be very proud. But it's important to note that our efforts are also strengthening Thermo Fisher for the future, and making us a more valuable partner for our customers. I see many positive trends from this period that will increase our contributions to healthcare. A few examples that I referenced during our recent analyst meeting are worth repeating. We're seeing much greater collaboration among industry and governments globally. Funding for research diagnostics and development of therapies and vaccines will increase to prepare for future health threats. We'll see more focus on supply chain security and the building of national stockpiles as well, and all of this has put a significant spotlight on the need for a stronger commitment to improving healthcare systems globally. We're already seeing the impact of these trends on our business, and I'll give you a number of examples later in my remarks, but first, I'll review our financial performance and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets. From a financial perspective, in Q3, we continue to work with speed at scale to support our customers, generating approximately $2 billion of COVID-19-related revenue in the quarter. At the same time, our teams did excellent work to grow our base business. This led to exceptional performance across all of our key financial metrics. Our reported revenue increased 36% in Q3 year-over-year to $8.52 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 97%, to $2.80 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased to 32.9%, and we grew our adjusted EPS by 91%, to $5.63 per share in the quarter. We're continuing to manage the company appropriately in a very fluid environment, exercising the cost discipline that you'd expect from us, while investing significantly in new products, services, and capabilities that will create value over the longer-term. Turning to our end markets, our performance was a combination of our significant pandemic response and the return to growth in our base business. Starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets, we delivered an excellent Q3, growing 20%. We've performed very well in this end market for many years, and we further accelerated our growth by helping these customers to ramp up development of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. The combination of strong market fundamentals and pandemic-related activities led to strength across all of the businesses servicing this end market, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the low single digits in Q3. We captured opportunities as more of these customers returned to work and their research activities increased. Turning to industrial and applied, while we declined in the low single digits during the quarter, we saw a meaningful sequential improvement from Q2. Last, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had an incredible quarter, delivering 130% growth. While we continue to see the impact of a lower level of routine doctor visits and related testing, demand did improve from Q2 levels and our COVID-related testing revenue grew significantly during the quarter. We saw the benefits of these dynamics across our Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics businesses. As you know, our involvement here includes providing both proprietary COVID-19 diagnostic test kits as well as reagents used for laboratory-developed tests, along with sample collection products and instrumentation. So, in summary, our teams put forth an amazing effort in Q3, not only increasing our response to the pandemic but also returning our base business the growth. The combination resulted in performance that positions us to deliver our best year yet. Turning to our business highlights for the quarter, as you know, we continue to increase our capabilities so we can the best partner for our customers and strengthen our competitive position. In Q3, we worked with speed at scale to address the critical needs brought on by the pandemic, while making great progress in executing our growth strategy across our businesses. Let me cover a few of the highlights. In terms of our pandemic response, we continue to expand our role as a trusted partner for industry and governments around the world. It's important to note that while this has clearly driven exceptional growth for us so far this year, much of what we're putting in place now will create sustainable value longer-term. First, as you know, we have the leading position in providing COVID-19 diagnostic test kits given our gold standard PCR-based tests and our industry-leading install base of instruments, and we continue to expand our presence by bringing new solutions to the market that help the medical community ramp up testing capacity, and enable society's return to work and school. In September, we launched a new highly automated solution called Amplitude that helps laboratories quickly scale up to meet testing volumes. This platform is based on our TaqPath combo kit and the QuantStudio 7 PCR instruments, and has the highest sample throughput in the industry. We're seeing strong demand for this innovative solution, and we've already completed installation at several customer sites. We also recently introduced two new Thermo Scientific antibody tests, our OmniPath ELISA test received emergency use authorization from FDA for the qualitative detection of total antibodies, and our new EliA test is now available to run on our Phadia 250 instrument so customers can tap into the extensive install base worldwide. Both tests can be used in the U.S. as well as Europe, and other countries accepting the CE mark. As I reflect on the long-term, we're now recognized by our customers as a scale player in infectious disease testing. We've significantly increased our install base of sample preparation and PCR instruments over the last nine months, and that will create new opportunities for us going forward. Another example of sustainable value is that we continue to ramp up production of supplies that are essential to the testing process, such as liquid handling plastics and the specialized viral transport media used in sample collection. We highlighted the opening of our new viral transport media facility, in Kansas, last quarter, and in Q3, we announced plans to further expand our global capacity by building a new facility in Scotland to support the European market. We're also significantly expanding capacity for our lab plastics to meet surging demand which will put us in a great position long-term as well, and important point that I want to make here is that our PPI business system is a key advantage in our ability to scale our operations quickly and cost-effectively to meet our customers' needs and drive growth. One more example of sustainable value creation is our support of new therapies and vaccines. We're significantly adding capacity across our biosciences, bioproduction, and former services businesses, creating an infrastructure that will position us incredibly well for the future. In our biosciences business, we're significantly investing in our global capacity to increase the manufacturing of enzymes and nucleotides used in vaccines. In pharma services, last week we announced our partnership with the Economic Development Board of Singapore to expand our sterile fill finish capacity by building our first facility there. Once operational in 2022, the facility will include the only high-speed filling line for live viruses in Singapore and help meet the demand across the Asia-Pacific region. This is another great example of how we're working with speed with governments to help them respond effectively to health emergencies in the future. In addition to government-funded projects, including our BARDA project to increase capacity in the U.S., that we highlighted last quarter, we've committed more than $700 million in CapEx to add global capacity to meet COVID-related demand. In summary, all of this work is clearly essential to helping our customers navigate the pandemic, and it's also giving us new capabilities and capacity that will be repurposed to meet future demand for vaccines and therapies. While our COVID-19 response contributed significantly to our performance, we are also continuing to make great progress in executing our growth strategy across the business. I'll give you just a few highlights from the quarter. In terms of innovation, we launched a number of significant new products in Q3. Let me pick a couple to highlight, one from our electron microscopy business and one from bioproduction. Our new Thermo Scientific Selectris X Imaging Filters are breakthrough advances in cryo-EM for structural biology applications. These new filters allow scientists to view protein structures in unprecedented detail and in less time than what was previously possible. This will not only accelerate research but also accelerate the adoption of cryo-EM, and another new product is our Thermo Scientific POROS Oligo resin which is used to purify and isolate mRNA for the development of vaccines and therapies. As mRNA production accelerates, the needs of highly scalable purification technology will be critical. In emerging markets our leading scale continues to be an advantage for us, and we are expanding our presence to meet customer demand. During the quarter we celebrated the grand opening of a new factory in Suzhou, China, for our single use bio-production technologies. As you know, we already have a well-established lab products operation in Suzhou, and this expansion is our first bio-production facility in the Asia-Pacific region, which will help meet increasing demand there for biologics. Our teams in China have effectively managed through the pandemic while positioning the business for growth, and we were pleased to deliver 18% growth in China in Q3. The last part I want to highlight around the progress we are making across our business is tied to our unique value proposition. Our customers recognize that we stepped up in a major way to help them navigate the challenging environment and that's creating new opportunities to build on our already strong relationships. This is very evident in forming biotech as you know, and now increasingly so with healthcare and diagnostic customers as well. During this time, the advantage of our leading scale and depth of capabilities has never been more evident, and this will lead to share gain opportunities longer term. Before I turn to our guidance, I'll make a quick a comment on capital deployment. As you know, our capital deployment strategy is a combination of returning capital through buybacks and dividends and strategic M&A. In terms of our view on M&A, we continue to have an active deal pipeline. We have a very strong balance sheet, and as always, we'll apply disciplined quiet approach the opportunities that meet our criteria for creating shareholder value. Turning to our guidance, there has obviously been a tremendous effort in supporting the COVID-19 response this year, and we've also executed well to grow our base business. This combination led to extraordinary growth and performance in Q3, and we expect that to continue to Q4. With that context, we expect to grow full-year 2020 revenue by 20% to approximately $30.5 billion, and we expect to grow our full-year 2020 adjusted EPS by 48% to $18.27 per share. Stephen will give you more of the details, but clearly, we are on track to achieve our truly spectacular year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a couple of takeaways. We continue to expand our leading role in responding to the pandemic, and we are having a profound impact on society. We are executing very well to capture new opportunities, gain market share, and drive growth across our businesses. Our efforts this year are significantly strengthening our company and positioning us very well for the long term. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a high level summary of our Q3 performance. As Marc mentioned, we have another exceptional quarter and grew organically 34%. I'll break this down into two elements. The first is the scale of our COVID-19 response revenue that we generated during the quarter, and the second is the performance of the base business. Our COVID-19 response revenue in the third quarter was $2 billion and contributed 31% to growth; largely driven by testing related products and instruments. Our base business excluding the COVID-19 revenue grew organically 3%. We are very pleased to deliver a 13-point improvement from Q2 driven by a higher customer activity levels and great commercial execution. The 34% organic growth for the quarter was higher than the updated our recent analyst meeting, as we continue to have robust demand for testing, and the potential risks around the level of customer activity did not materialize. Our PPI business system enabled excellent pull through on the 34% organic growth, a combination of fixed cost leverage and operating with speed at scale enabled us to deliver 91% growth in adjusted earnings per share on the quarter, a truly exceptional result. I'll now provide more details on our third quarter results then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q3 earnings results, as I mentioned we grew adjusted EPS by 91% to $5.63. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.84 up 157% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our Q3 reported revenue grew 36% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 34% organic growth, a foreign exchange tailwind of 1% and 1% growth from acquisitions. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter, North America grew 40%, Europe grew 25%, Asia Pacific grew just under 20% as the China and rest of the world grew 65%. Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased to 97% and adjusted operating margin was 32.9%, 10 percentage points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled it to drive exceptional volume leverage and strong productivity, and we had a favorable business mix. At the same time, we continue to make some significant strategic investments across the businesses. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 52.3%, up 620 basis points from Q3 of the prior year. The increase in gross margin had similar drivers to those I just mentioned for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16% of revenue, a decrease of 350 basis points versus Q3 2019 reflecting the very strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was $296 million, 20% higher than Q3 2019 and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 5.2%. Looking our results below the line for the quarter, net interest expense was $135 million, $24 million higher than Q3 last year, primarily due to increased debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense with net income in the quarter was approximately $2 million, $24 million lower than Q3 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.7%. This is up 450 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rates. Average diluted shares were $399 million in Q3 about $5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash flow was another great highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system is enabling us to deliver great cash pull through on the very strong top line performance. For the first nine months, cash flow from continuing operations was $5 billion and free cash flow was $4.1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. We returned approximately $90 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter, and we ended Q3 with approximately $7.5 billion in cash and $21.1 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.6 times on a net basis. Concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 14.9%, up 330 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate a very strong return. Now to provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts around the impact of COVID-19 response had on the segment results. From a revenue standpoint in Q3, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is reflected in Life Science Solutions. This is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. It also includes revenue from therapy and vaccine production supplies recognized in the bioproduction business. The Specialty Diagnostics segments include revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue to viral transport media in the microbiology business and for tests and PP&E in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue for therapy and vaccine support biopharma services business. The segment also includes revenue for PPE in the recession safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by a lab products business. So, a lot of detail to take in, but I think it really demonstrates the breadth of our societal response to the pandemic. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments, based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses, even though that we're not benefiting from COVID-19 response revenue. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation recognition, as well as commercial R&D and production capability investments. We are able to do this given the strength of the company's overall performance. The size of these investments does not necessarily align with COVID-19 response revenue in each segment. So that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint, it reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and positioning the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, in Q3, reported revenue increased 101%, and organic revenue growth was 100%. We saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses, as well as very strong growth in our bioproduction business. In Q3, adjusted operating income and lifestyle solutions increased 221%, and adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, up 20 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull through at public business mix and continue to make strategic investments across the businesses in the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 2% in Q3, and an organic revenue decline of 3%, an increased level of customer activity and good commercial execution led to a 20 percentage point sequential improvement in the business performance from Q2, and chromatography and mass spectrometry business return to growth in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income and Analytical Instruments decreased 45% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, down 10 percentage points year-over-year. Eight percentage points of this change was due to $100 million one-time accounting charge that we took in Q3 for a loss on a supply contract in our electron microscopy business. This was triggered by the very successful launch of our new Thermo scientific Selectris imaging filter. The remainder of the margin reduction in the quarter was driven by business mix, lower volumes and strategic investments, partially offset by strong productivity. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments, in Q3 reported revenue increased by 63%, organic revenue growth was 62%. COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The pandemic continues to impact routine diagnostic testing activity, and this is most pronounced in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses in the quarter. However, it was encouraging to see a substantial pickup in activity from Q2. Adjusted operating income increased 79% and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 260 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter we saw a very strong volume leverage partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. Finally in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q3 reported revenue increased 19%. Organic revenue growth was 16%. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our research and safety market channel, pharma services and laboratory products businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q3 increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, 20 basis points lower than prior year. In the quarter, the segment drove strong productivity and volume leverage, but this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. So with that, now let me turn to guidance. I'll provide you a current view for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2020. I'll also provide an update on certain full-year 2020 assumptions to help you with your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate for Q4 organic growth is 29%. That's driven by an expected $1.75 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and organic growth in the base business of low-to-mid single digits. The impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, and as a result, through potential outcomes both above and below the 29% that could play out in Q4. From a capacity standpoint, should that be customer demand above the 29% level, we're well positioned to be able to support our customers as we did in Q3. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we expect considerable volume leverage from the 29% organic growth in Q4. At that level of growth, we expect to deliver approximately 60% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share in Q4. A few additional points of color on this outlook, similar to prior quarters, the volume of testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor determining the extent of our COVID-19 response revenue in Q4. The outlook also includes a continued ramp in the support of therapies and vaccines. Regarding the base business growth, this assumes similar levels of activity to Q3, and the benefit of the two extra days being offset by slightly weaker year-end spend than in Q4 2019, given the current environment that seems like a reasonable assumption to start the quarter with a well-positioned to assist customers should funding availability be higher. The outlook does not anticipate to return to the lockdown seen at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. Supporting all of this in a full-year context, our current estimate for 2020 revenue is $30.52 billion, which would represent 20% growth over 2019 including 19% organic growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our current estimate for the full-year 2020 is $18.27, which represents 48% growth over 2019. We're on track for a truly spectacular year. I will now move on to an update of some of the additional modeling elements for the full-year. With regards to FX in 2020, we're now assuming that we'll have a negligible impact on revenue based on current FX rates. We expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $490 million. We're assuming that adjusted other net income will be about $50 million for the year and we expect the full-year adjusted income tax rate to be 14.2%. Net capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This includes $400 million of CapEx to support our COVID-19 response in 2020. We continue to execute while on growth related CapEx opportunities particularly in our pharma services and bioproduction businesses. These have short and long-term benefits and provide very strong returns on investment. In terms of capital deployments, we completed the $1.5 billion a share buybacks in Q1 and assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We're also continuing to assume that we're returning approximately $350 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we estimate that the full-year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. So, to wrap up, as you can see from our exceptional performance in Q3, we continue to manage the company extremely effectively strengthen our leadership in responding to the global pandemic, and position ourselves to deliver a spectacular year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.\nKenneth Apicerno: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter, certainly impressive. Marc, I want to start with the LPS strength, 16% organic. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on how much of this is vaccine ramp versus recovery and non-COVID-related trial work, was there any kind of catch-up benefit here in the quarter from stuff in 2Q, and how do you think about sustaining this level and ramping on the LPS side and into 4Q and 2021?\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. So, in terms of our Lab Products & Services businesses, all three of the businesses performed in the quarter. So that's pharma services, our CDMO activities, that's our customer channels group, and that's our lab products business, and we saw activity ramp up, as we did for the whole company, on the sort of normal business activity in the quarter, and at the same point, you're seeing two different types or three different types of COVID-related response embedded in those numbers. Clearly, the vaccine and therapy ramp up is happening, and you see that certainly in our pharma services business. You're also seeing very significant demand in our customer channels business for things like PPE as well as all the supplies you would use for COVID response. And then in our lab products business, we have very strong demand for our lab plastics as well as our cold storage equipment. As you know, we're a market leader in providing cold storage for laboratory use, and effectively, when you read about some of the vaccines needed cold storage across the supply chain we're getting very, very significant demand for those products. The basis is very good, right, so that's gone well, and then obviously on top of that you're seeing the benefits of those types of activity.\nTycho Peterson: Great, and then a follow-up just on the plastic side, curious on your views on the durability of that non-automated PCR business which had driven a lot of strength in the first-half of the year, and then with Amplitude, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about positioning there. Obviously it's got the highest throughput, as you noted. Is the traction you're seeing now from academic labs, are you seeing interest from reference labs or hospitals, can you just talk about how you think about both the durability of non-amplified testing, and then Amplitude as well. Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so, Tycho, in terms of the demand for our PCR testing, it continues to be very strong, right, and if you think about it, gold standard performance in terms of accuracy, largest install base of instruments around the world, and we have supplied our customers and ramped up, and we have been the supplier that there's been no headaches really from a customer perspective through the pandemic. We have built our capacity ahead of demand consistently, and therefore customers have been happy, and know they can rely on us. Amplitude is an ultra-high throughput system, over 6,000 tests per day, and we're seeing very large demand. We've seen that demand from governments, we've seen that demand from reference labs and hospital systems, right. So it is a niche application but drives enormous volumes, right, because ultra-high throughput, so those labs, those governments that are really providing the support for high volume, given our supply reliability, the quality of our tests, and the dedication that we've had throughout the pandemic, that product will be a good growth driver. In terms of durability, we believe that PCR testing is going to continue to be very relevant to our customers because it gives you the most accurate information, and therefore we're comfortable with continuing with a strong level of demand in the fourth quarter, and we expect that those products are going to be relevant in 2021 because, unfortunately, the pandemic is still with us. Thanks, Tycho.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Vijay Kumar from Evercore, your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Thank you, guys, and congrats, Marc, you guys are setting a new bar trying to beat that pre-announced revenue, that's really impressive. Maybe on just the Q4 guidance there, I guess we were looking $2 billion of, I guess -- $1.6 billion of COVID tailwinds for 3Q that's coming in north of $2 billion here for 3Q, so one -- and if you look at the guidance for Q4 of $1.75 billion, I'm just curious if -- if was there any tiny element, did some of the tailwinds get pulled forward to 3Q, and when you look at the base guidance of low to mid single digits maybe it looks like a lot of it is being driven by biopharma. Maybe comment on industrial and academic environment heading into Q4.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so, Vijay, thanks for the question, and it's exciting to be able to set a new bar on performance, right. So that's been an interesting time for sure. In terms of our guidance, the way that we think about the fourth quarter is base business similar to what we saw in Q3 to a little bit better, and what's assumed in there, and it's an assumption, it's not based on customer feedback, is that year-end spend is softer than it was last year, and we're well positioned to meet it if higher demand, if customers have the funding, and our logic to that was it's a little bit early to know. It's a conservative assumption, and we don't want to disappoint. So if the funding is strong you know that, like we did in these last few quarters or many years actually, if the money is out there we're going to go out and get it, right. So that's the view on the base business, of low to mid single digit growth. When you look at the $1.75 billion, we see very strong demand right now for our COVID response. We're seeing a continued build in our vaccine and therapy role, and we are also seeing very strong demand for our testing solutions as well. You have less visibility into the month of December. So we have much better visibility, obviously, in October and November, and we just made an assumption that levels were going to be pretty similar to what we saw in the third quarter, and we came in at $1.75 billion. I wouldn't over-read into why $1.75 billion versus $2 billion, it's just that we have visibility for a couple of months, and December we have less visibility, but nonetheless it seems like demand should be strong.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Marc, and just one follow-up on, I guess, at the analyst day you made a comment about contractors orders on the vaccine worked about a billion, any update on that number?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so in terms of our role for vaccines and therapeutics, we said over the balance of this year, '21, and '22 it's about $1 billion, and than number continues to grow, so I'd call it a $1 billion-plus at this point. We're active in a significant number of projects, something in the range of over 250 projects on therapies and vaccines, and our role is quite broad, it's not just pharma services, it's bioproduction, biosciences, and -- so that will be a -- is contributing to our revenue, but will contribute more certainly as the fourth quarter, and into the next year progresses.\nVijay Kumar: Thank you, guys.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research, your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi, good morning, and thanks for the time here. I wanted to ask one on academic, just looking to unpack a little bit of the commentary in the prepared remarks, and then one just very quick follow-up on Amplitude and the broader testing landscape. My question on academic is a two-parter. I guess one is, we all watch all the headlines about what's going on in the university backdrop. I wonder if you could give your perspective on research labs within universities and broader research sort of opening up here as we progress through the back-half of the year, to what extent is that reopening necessarily contingent upon a broader university reopening, and then to your point on funding, Marc, certainly makes a lot of sense, but to what extent is that a medium-term versus a near-term perspective on funding just given all the unknowns right now, not necessarily in the U.S., but in China and Europe as it relates to how they're going about funding in research.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so, Steve, thanks for the questions. So, in terms of the academic and government, good to see the return to growth, clearly more customers came back to work, ramping up research activities, and that actually was a global phenomenon; we saw that across all three of the regions, and they all happened at different paces, but it's good to see that. When I made the comments at the very beginning of my remarks, really the funding environment I'm thinking about is the midterm, right, it's [technical difficulty] -- what I mean by that is there's such interest now in infectious disease, the pandemic, the importance, like in the U.S., of how NIH has played a huge role here. Those things are going to really, for the midterm, be very positive on a funding environment. Even short-term we're seeing quite a bit of interest from governments, and then obviously academic institutions, their own situation is probably much more impacted by their own economics, so that's going to be somewhat of a headwind, but that historically has been a low to mid single-digit growth market, and it's good to see we're already back to low single-digit growth there.\nSteve Beuchaw: Super clear. The follow-up, building on some of the commentary around Amplitude, looks like an approach that makes a lot of sense, not just for higher acuity or symptomatic, but for screening, which should be interesting to hear how you think the market for testing PCR and more broadly evolves towards screening over the next year and beyond, given that you have a unique perspective on all sides of the market? Thanks again.\nMarc Casper: Well, Steve, in terms of the role of testing, obviously managing in a pandemic is around social distancing, mask-wearing, good hygiene, and all of those things, and testing is a valuable supplemental tool to that, and we're seeing more and more demand for testing in those applications as well for kind of return-to-life is what we call it, which is really work in school, and things like the Amplitude is going to be able to support both medical applications as well as screening. You get a very high throughput, it's very economic, and therefore customers can get results quite rapidly, and therefore it plays a role, and what you're getting with PCR is extreme levels of accuracy versus some of the other technologies out there, which also will play a role, but you are trading accuracy, and depending on what the application is that's something that there certain applications doesn't make a lot of sense for. Operator, we'll take the next one.\nOperator: Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, great. Thank you, and good morning. So a little bit of -- can you give us a little bit more color on the split in the quarter on testing PPE in bioproduction, just how that $2 billion broke down that, and then I've got a follow-up.\nMarc Casper: Yes, Derik, good morning. So in terms of the $2 billion, the majority is the testing related portion of that, and when you think about the testing portion it's actually quite expansive, right. So the single largest piece of that is going to be on our proprietary COVID-19 TaqPath kits, PCR kits, but we also have significant revenue from instrumentation and lab-developed tests. So that's kind of the PCR ecosystem with all of the very substantial sample prep that we provide across the industry as well. We really have built tremendous momentum there. On top of that, our viral transport media business has grown very rapidly, so Q3 was a nice step up from Q2, and we expect that to continue to grow, and that is a key part of the specimen collection, sample collection and transport to a lab, and so that we'll continue to build, and we announced that we're opening up a new facility in Scotland. We broke ground on that, be able to start producing viral transport media at the end of the year to start the European market, beyond the two facilities in Europe that already do that. So that continues to be important. From the next aspect, which is probably the smallest aspect at this point, which is PPE, as you would expect there was clearly -- that's all through our channel business. There was very elevated prices in the beginning of the pandemic as there was massive supply constraints. Volume has still be high, pricing has come down, and so, therefore while there's a moderate level of activity a lot of volume at a lower price, and that's good from a societal standpoint. It's good to see suppliers catching up with demand, and then from the -- probably the fastest-growing and building is our broad role in kind of, I'll say, vaccines and therapies, and I'm going to define it broadly because I think that sometimes because we have the most comprehensive position in the industry that we don't get clearly compared to the right activity. So the way to think about it, and Stephen was articulating it, there's what we provide to the manufacturers of a vaccine or a therapy, and historically you'd look at that as bioproduction, and that would be our leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technology, and our rapidly growing position in purification resins. At the same point, our biosciences business actually has a very meaningful role in that as well through the enzyme and nucleotide production, and we're doing very substantial expansions of capacity to support those needs as well. So, that's one set of activity. The second set of the activity is obviously around our pharma services business, and you would see that in our sterile fill-finish network, where you do the filling of a vaccine or a biologic, but you also see that in our drug substance or biologics plants, and even with some of the antivirals that are small molecules, you can see them in our API facility. So, we're incredibly well-positioned in a very skill way to serve the vaccine and therapy opportunities, and you're already starting to see that build, and that will continue to build in Q4 and into next year.\nDerik de Bruin: Right, and just one quick follow-up, so you talked about your analytical instrumentation business, essentially back, you know, essentially roughly flat, are you dealing with back orders from the first-half of the year, or are you seeing new orders for LCMS, and then a appendix on that one is, what's your PCR base instrument install base up year-over-year, if you can get a sense?\nMarc Casper: So, in terms of the revenue, the really strong sequential improvement in revenue for Q3 versus Q2, the answer there is our orders are growing much faster than the revenue. So, we're actually building backlog. So, I don't think it is much of shifting from Q2 to Q3, just customer activity is really been picking up. You see that most quickly in our life science mass spec business and chromatography business. That business returned to growth in the quarter from a revenue perspective, and bookings were stronger than that. So, that's very encouraging, and then, as you would expect on the flip side, those areas that are very economically sensitive like chemical analysis, that's lagging, right, improved substantially, but lagging relative to the life sciences mass spec, and we have from a install base of sample prep and qPCR, we're shipping in a quarter what we would normally ship in a year. So, it doesn't give you the exact number, but it gives you the sense of the magnitude of how big that's been.\nDerik de Bruin: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: You are welcome.\nOperator: Doug Schenkel from Cowen, your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Marc, during the Analyst Day last month, you commented I think in response to a question that COVID-19 tailwinds could be lower, about the same or higher on a year-over-year basis in 2021, do you have any updated thoughts on this, at this point, particularly in light of higher than expected COVID-19 contributions in Q3 and incorporating what you're seeing especially on the bioproduction side, given demand there has materialized a bit more recently, relative to diagnostics, and then, kind of building off of that longer-term meeting really beyond 2021. Do you think the investments you're making to support COVID-19 demand in each today and in 2021 will lead to at least stable levels of revenue in these product categories, even when the pandemic abates?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Doug, what I can say is that on the first one, I have to be 100%, right on the answer, right, if it's either up down or flat, then I\u2026\nDoug Schenkel: Yes, yes.\nMarc Casper: [Multiple speakers] -- 100% accuracy on. So, those are two great questions, right? So, if I think about things that are building, clearly the broadly, you know, position and bioproduction, our pharma services business or biosciences nucleotide, that's all building, right? So, and then that's better than three or four weeks ago. It doesn't -- as you know, these things are very long cycle, they're moving at a much faster pace, but it takes a while for these products to get through the clinical process with approvals, and looking for efficacy. So, we see that building, and that's good for us in terms of what the outlook is. In terms of -- you know, unfortunately every day and week that we're still living with the pandemic means that things like testing are likely to be more durable, right? So that, you know, even six weeks or so after the analyst meeting, we're really in the same boat with actually more cases in Europe and a lot of increases in the pandemic. That usually adds to the view that there's going to be more durability to this going into '21, but we'll know more as we get into the year. So, in terms of the longer-term investments, a great question, right, the way to think about it is, we're investing significantly, you know $700 million is almost what we normally put in capital in the year roughly, right, so it's additional. We are it doing quickly, right. If you think about the pace that we are actually bringing facilities online gives you sense of the power of the PPI Business System. Pretty much everything that you are seeing we are going to repurpose longer term to other markets that are not pandemic-related, right, and some of them are very easy to visualize, right, which is think about start for finish, we have commitments for the expansions that we have done for vaccines and therapies, and we are also already getting commitments from customers -- large customers that basically say when that demand is freed up, we want to put other products in that demand, right.\n it's :\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, and I'll leave it there, and let others ask other questions. Thank you very much.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Doug.\nOperator: Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research, your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi, good morning. Two questions for you, Marc, one just following up on some previous commentary if you don't mind, you talked about how you are assuming a weaker end of your spending environment within the guidance that you provided today, but I am curious as to your comments talking about how you are seeing customer activity really picking up, orders growing faster than revenue. Just wondering if you could provide any color on how those two -- the different comments sort of jive with each other, and then I have on follow-up for you.\nMarc Casper: Stephen, you want to talk a little bit about that?\nStephen Williamson: No, so the comment about picking up versus Q2 so that sequential improvement in performance, and the assumption is similar levels of aggregate customer level activity in Q4, and yes, we have made an assumption around yearend spend, but as Marc said, if it's going to be higher, then our business is well-positioned to help our customers satisfy that demand.\nMarc Casper: And Steve, another way we have a say lots of discussions with our customers. It's a little tacky right now to say, so what is your yearend budget going to look like. It's just not a topic that is where you are focused on which is -- so not helping you, right, and this is not a normal year. So, I think that's a good place to start again for the quarter.\nSteve Willoughby: Very good, okay, and then I was just wondering if you could comment at all regarding the bioprocessing business overall, and what you saw in terms of level of growth there and maybe also maybe a level of orders for the bioprocessing business overall? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Growth is very strong, stronger than the historically strong performance, and orders were significantly stronger than that strong growth, so very, very high level of order growth which you would expect, right. We play a major role in the therapies and vaccines broadly in all classes of disease, and we are playing a significant role in COVID. So, we are seeing very strong demand for our capabilities. Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is open.\nDan Arias: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, maybe just a follow-up on some color on bioproduction, can you comment on the visibility in terms of products and services when it comes to non-COVID work? I mean obviously it's all strong at a high level, but I guess I am just trying to understand the extent to which there is maybe from incremental uncertainty when you look at companies that are balancing COVID and non-COVID project loads. I mean are there error bars around the timing in some of this non-COVID campaign work that might be wider than normal as they move real fast here? Or, does it sort of all looks steady from where you sit at this point?\nMarc Casper: It seems pretty steady. I mean if think about manufacturing across the industry not our customers, has been smooth sailing through this period of time, right. Companies have been able to produce their medicines and develop their products for -- through the development process. So, we haven't seen COVID-related disruptions on the manufacturing side of biotech and pharmaceutical. It continues to grow very substantially. So, obviously there is going to be some diversion of short-term resources. So, maybe two or three years from now there is some project that has been theoretically less than what it could have been because of COVID work, but I think that's very much in the noise level, because if I look at things like new quotations and new activities, it's extraordinary high and our development work, clinical trials work. So, I think it's very good.\nDan Arias: Okay, appreciate that. Maybe Stephen, can I just touch on Patheon for second there, and the margin mix within LPS? I think this Patheon was 17% or so at the up margin line when you bought the company. Obviously, the volume environment there looks pretty good. So, if we were to look forward, do you that business over the next couple of years can increasingly sort of provide some loss to LPS segment profitability if demand just shapes up here the way that it's look like it could?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, I think we've made great progress with the margins in that business, and future as we drive more utilization of capacity will be very strong for the margin profile. Thanks, Dan.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Dan. Operator, we are going to take just one more.\nOperator: Jack Meehan from Nephron Research, your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.\nMarc Casper: Hi, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Marc, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the R&D investment. It's my favorite data point in the press release. So, just where are you maybe over-indexing some of the incremental spend? Are you pulling forward projects or diving deeper down the list, and is there a way to think about the payback on some this incremental spend? How long that should take?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. R&D spend was up about 20% in the quarter. So, we're investing substantially. It's really about adding more talent is the step that we are doing, and then working on some key areas that -- where demand actually has been a little bit softer. So, what we are doing is kind of doubling down the investment to position ourselves for strong growth for the long term. Very much the exact playbook we did in the financial crisis where we had a very high focus on investing in R&D so that we would bounce back out of the downturn quickly, and we did, and so we are doing that same playbook in certain areas and returns will show up in the next couple of years is the way to think about it. Thank you, Jack, for the question, and let me wrap up with a couple of things, first that we are certainly proud of our role in helping our customers and society during this time. We are going to continue to manage the company appropriately to come out of this period and even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress at yearend. I hope that you stay safe, and as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a high level summary of our Q3 performance. As Marc mentioned, we have another exceptional quarter and grew organically 34%. I'll break this down into two elements. The first is the scale of our COVID-19 response revenue that we generated during the quarter, and the second is the performance of the base business. Our COVID-19 response revenue in the third quarter was $2 billion and contributed 31% to growth; largely driven by testing related products and instruments. Our base business excluding the COVID-19 revenue grew organically 3%. We are very pleased to deliver a 13-point improvement from Q2 driven by a higher customer activity levels and great commercial execution. The 34% organic growth for the quarter was higher than the updated our recent analyst meeting, as we continue to have robust demand for testing, and the potential risks around the level of customer activity did not materialize. Our PPI business system enabled excellent pull through on the 34% organic growth, a combination of fixed cost leverage and operating with speed at scale enabled us to deliver 91% growth in adjusted earnings per share on the quarter, a truly exceptional result. I'll now provide more details on our third quarter results then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q3 earnings results, as I mentioned we grew adjusted EPS by 91% to $5.63. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.84 up 157% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our Q3 reported revenue grew 36% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 34% organic growth, a foreign exchange tailwind of 1% and 1% growth from acquisitions. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter, North America grew 40%, Europe grew 25%, Asia Pacific grew just under 20% as the China and rest of the world grew 65%. Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased to 97% and adjusted operating margin was 32.9%, 10 percentage points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled it to drive exceptional volume leverage and strong productivity, and we had a favorable business mix. At the same time, we continue to make some significant strategic investments across the businesses. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 52.3%, up 620 basis points from Q3 of the prior year. The increase in gross margin had similar drivers to those I just mentioned for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16% of revenue, a decrease of 350 basis points versus Q3 2019 reflecting the very strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was $296 million, 20% higher than Q3 2019 and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 5.2%. Looking our results below the line for the quarter, net interest expense was $135 million, $24 million higher than Q3 last year, primarily due to increased debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense with net income in the quarter was approximately $2 million, $24 million lower than Q3 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.7%. This is up 450 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rates. Average diluted shares were $399 million in Q3 about $5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash flow was another great highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system is enabling us to deliver great cash pull through on the very strong top line performance. For the first nine months, cash flow from continuing operations was $5 billion and free cash flow was $4.1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. We returned approximately $90 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter, and we ended Q3 with approximately $7.5 billion in cash and $21.1 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.6 times on a net basis. Concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 14.9%, up 330 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate a very strong return. Now to provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts around the impact of COVID-19 response had on the segment results. From a revenue standpoint in Q3, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is reflected in Life Science Solutions. This is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. It also includes revenue from therapy and vaccine production supplies recognized in the bioproduction business. The Specialty Diagnostics segments include revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue to viral transport media in the microbiology business and for tests and PP&E in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue for therapy and vaccine support biopharma services business. The segment also includes revenue for PPE in the recession safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by a lab products business. So, a lot of detail to take in, but I think it really demonstrates the breadth of our societal response to the pandemic. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments, based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses, even though that we're not benefiting from COVID-19 response revenue. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation recognition, as well as commercial R&D and production capability investments. We are able to do this given the strength of the company's overall performance. The size of these investments does not necessarily align with COVID-19 response revenue in each segment. So that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint, it reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and positioning the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, in Q3, reported revenue increased 101%, and organic revenue growth was 100%. We saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses, as well as very strong growth in our bioproduction business. In Q3, adjusted operating income and lifestyle solutions increased 221%, and adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, up 20 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull through at public business mix and continue to make strategic investments across the businesses in the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 2% in Q3, and an organic revenue decline of 3%, an increased level of customer activity and good commercial execution led to a 20 percentage point sequential improvement in the business performance from Q2, and chromatography and mass spectrometry business return to growth in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income and Analytical Instruments decreased 45% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, down 10 percentage points year-over-year. Eight percentage points of this change was due to $100 million one-time accounting charge that we took in Q3 for a loss on a supply contract in our electron microscopy business. This was triggered by the very successful launch of our new Thermo scientific Selectris imaging filter. The remainder of the margin reduction in the quarter was driven by business mix, lower volumes and strategic investments, partially offset by strong productivity. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments, in Q3 reported revenue increased by 63%, organic revenue growth was 62%. COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The pandemic continues to impact routine diagnostic testing activity, and this is most pronounced in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses in the quarter. However, it was encouraging to see a substantial pickup in activity from Q2. Adjusted operating income increased 79% and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 260 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter we saw a very strong volume leverage partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. Finally in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q3 reported revenue increased 19%. Organic revenue growth was 16%. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our research and safety market channel, pharma services and laboratory products businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q3 increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, 20 basis points lower than prior year. In the quarter, the segment drove strong productivity and volume leverage, but this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. So with that, now let me turn to guidance. I'll provide you a current view for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2020. I'll also provide an update on certain full-year 2020 assumptions to help you with your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate for Q4 organic growth is 29%. That's driven by an expected $1.75 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and organic growth in the base business of low-to-mid single digits. The impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, and as a result, through potential outcomes both above and below the 29% that could play out in Q4. From a capacity standpoint, should that be customer demand above the 29% level, we're well positioned to be able to support our customers as we did in Q3. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we expect considerable volume leverage from the 29% organic growth in Q4. At that level of growth, we expect to deliver approximately 60% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share in Q4. A few additional points of color on this outlook, similar to prior quarters, the volume of testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor determining the extent of our COVID-19 response revenue in Q4. The outlook also includes a continued ramp in the support of therapies and vaccines. Regarding the base business growth, this assumes similar levels of activity to Q3, and the benefit of the two extra days being offset by slightly weaker year-end spend than in Q4 2019, given the current environment that seems like a reasonable assumption to start the quarter with a well-positioned to assist customers should funding availability be higher. The outlook does not anticipate to return to the lockdown seen at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. Supporting all of this in a full-year context, our current estimate for 2020 revenue is $30.52 billion, which would represent 20% growth over 2019 including 19% organic growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our current estimate for the full-year 2020 is $18.27, which represents 48% growth over 2019. We're on track for a truly spectacular year. I will now move on to an update of some of the additional modeling elements for the full-year. With regards to FX in 2020, we're now assuming that we'll have a negligible impact on revenue based on current FX rates. We expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $490 million. We're assuming that adjusted other net income will be about $50 million for the year and we expect the full-year adjusted income tax rate to be 14.2%. Net capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This includes $400 million of CapEx to support our COVID-19 response in 2020. We continue to execute while on growth related CapEx opportunities particularly in our pharma services and bioproduction businesses. These have short and long-term benefits and provide very strong returns on investment. In terms of capital deployments, we completed the $1.5 billion a share buybacks in Q1 and assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We're also continuing to assume that we're returning approximately $350 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we estimate that the full-year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. So, to wrap up, as you can see from our exceptional performance in Q3, we continue to manage the company extremely effectively strengthen our leadership in responding to the global pandemic, and position ourselves to deliver a spectacular year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. No, so the comment about picking up versus Q2 so that sequential improvement in performance, and the assumption is similar levels of aggregate customer level activity in Q4, and yes, we have made an assumption around yearend spend, but as Marc said, if it's going to be higher, then our business is well-positioned to help our customers satisfy that demand. Yes. So, I think we've made great progress with the margins in that business, and future as we drive more utilization of capacity will be very strong for the margin profile. Thanks, Dan."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered exceptional performance again in Q3 as we continue to build on the significant progress we made last quarter. I continue to be humbled by the incredible efforts of our team as they answer the call to help our customers and society manage through this unprecedented time. Not only did they expand our leading role in supporting the Global COVID-19 response, but they also effectively managed through this environment to return our base business to growth. The work we're doing today is clearly having a profound impact on the world, and for that we can be very proud. But it's important to note that our efforts are also strengthening Thermo Fisher for the future, and making us a more valuable partner for our customers. I see many positive trends from this period that will increase our contributions to healthcare. A few examples that I referenced during our recent analyst meeting are worth repeating. We're seeing much greater collaboration among industry and governments globally. Funding for research diagnostics and development of therapies and vaccines will increase to prepare for future health threats. We'll see more focus on supply chain security and the building of national stockpiles as well, and all of this has put a significant spotlight on the need for a stronger commitment to improving healthcare systems globally. We're already seeing the impact of these trends on our business, and I'll give you a number of examples later in my remarks, but first, I'll review our financial performance and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets. From a financial perspective, in Q3, we continue to work with speed at scale to support our customers, generating approximately $2 billion of COVID-19-related revenue in the quarter. At the same time, our teams did excellent work to grow our base business. This led to exceptional performance across all of our key financial metrics. Our reported revenue increased 36% in Q3 year-over-year to $8.52 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 97%, to $2.80 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased to 32.9%, and we grew our adjusted EPS by 91%, to $5.63 per share in the quarter. We're continuing to manage the company appropriately in a very fluid environment, exercising the cost discipline that you'd expect from us, while investing significantly in new products, services, and capabilities that will create value over the longer-term. Turning to our end markets, our performance was a combination of our significant pandemic response and the return to growth in our base business. Starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets, we delivered an excellent Q3, growing 20%. We've performed very well in this end market for many years, and we further accelerated our growth by helping these customers to ramp up development of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. The combination of strong market fundamentals and pandemic-related activities led to strength across all of the businesses servicing this end market, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the low single digits in Q3. We captured opportunities as more of these customers returned to work and their research activities increased. Turning to industrial and applied, while we declined in the low single digits during the quarter, we saw a meaningful sequential improvement from Q2. Last, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had an incredible quarter, delivering 130% growth. While we continue to see the impact of a lower level of routine doctor visits and related testing, demand did improve from Q2 levels and our COVID-related testing revenue grew significantly during the quarter. We saw the benefits of these dynamics across our Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics businesses. As you know, our involvement here includes providing both proprietary COVID-19 diagnostic test kits as well as reagents used for laboratory-developed tests, along with sample collection products and instrumentation. So, in summary, our teams put forth an amazing effort in Q3, not only increasing our response to the pandemic but also returning our base business the growth. The combination resulted in performance that positions us to deliver our best year yet. Turning to our business highlights for the quarter, as you know, we continue to increase our capabilities so we can the best partner for our customers and strengthen our competitive position. In Q3, we worked with speed at scale to address the critical needs brought on by the pandemic, while making great progress in executing our growth strategy across our businesses. Let me cover a few of the highlights. In terms of our pandemic response, we continue to expand our role as a trusted partner for industry and governments around the world. It's important to note that while this has clearly driven exceptional growth for us so far this year, much of what we're putting in place now will create sustainable value longer-term. First, as you know, we have the leading position in providing COVID-19 diagnostic test kits given our gold standard PCR-based tests and our industry-leading install base of instruments, and we continue to expand our presence by bringing new solutions to the market that help the medical community ramp up testing capacity, and enable society's return to work and school. In September, we launched a new highly automated solution called Amplitude that helps laboratories quickly scale up to meet testing volumes. This platform is based on our TaqPath combo kit and the QuantStudio 7 PCR instruments, and has the highest sample throughput in the industry. We're seeing strong demand for this innovative solution, and we've already completed installation at several customer sites. We also recently introduced two new Thermo Scientific antibody tests, our OmniPath ELISA test received emergency use authorization from FDA for the qualitative detection of total antibodies, and our new EliA test is now available to run on our Phadia 250 instrument so customers can tap into the extensive install base worldwide. Both tests can be used in the U.S. as well as Europe, and other countries accepting the CE mark. As I reflect on the long-term, we're now recognized by our customers as a scale player in infectious disease testing. We've significantly increased our install base of sample preparation and PCR instruments over the last nine months, and that will create new opportunities for us going forward. Another example of sustainable value is that we continue to ramp up production of supplies that are essential to the testing process, such as liquid handling plastics and the specialized viral transport media used in sample collection. We highlighted the opening of our new viral transport media facility, in Kansas, last quarter, and in Q3, we announced plans to further expand our global capacity by building a new facility in Scotland to support the European market. We're also significantly expanding capacity for our lab plastics to meet surging demand which will put us in a great position long-term as well, and important point that I want to make here is that our PPI business system is a key advantage in our ability to scale our operations quickly and cost-effectively to meet our customers' needs and drive growth. One more example of sustainable value creation is our support of new therapies and vaccines. We're significantly adding capacity across our biosciences, bioproduction, and former services businesses, creating an infrastructure that will position us incredibly well for the future. In our biosciences business, we're significantly investing in our global capacity to increase the manufacturing of enzymes and nucleotides used in vaccines. In pharma services, last week we announced our partnership with the Economic Development Board of Singapore to expand our sterile fill finish capacity by building our first facility there. Once operational in 2022, the facility will include the only high-speed filling line for live viruses in Singapore and help meet the demand across the Asia-Pacific region. This is another great example of how we're working with speed with governments to help them respond effectively to health emergencies in the future. In addition to government-funded projects, including our BARDA project to increase capacity in the U.S., that we highlighted last quarter, we've committed more than $700 million in CapEx to add global capacity to meet COVID-related demand. In summary, all of this work is clearly essential to helping our customers navigate the pandemic, and it's also giving us new capabilities and capacity that will be repurposed to meet future demand for vaccines and therapies. While our COVID-19 response contributed significantly to our performance, we are also continuing to make great progress in executing our growth strategy across the business. I'll give you just a few highlights from the quarter. In terms of innovation, we launched a number of significant new products in Q3. Let me pick a couple to highlight, one from our electron microscopy business and one from bioproduction. Our new Thermo Scientific Selectris X Imaging Filters are breakthrough advances in cryo-EM for structural biology applications. These new filters allow scientists to view protein structures in unprecedented detail and in less time than what was previously possible. This will not only accelerate research but also accelerate the adoption of cryo-EM, and another new product is our Thermo Scientific POROS Oligo resin which is used to purify and isolate mRNA for the development of vaccines and therapies. As mRNA production accelerates, the needs of highly scalable purification technology will be critical. In emerging markets our leading scale continues to be an advantage for us, and we are expanding our presence to meet customer demand. During the quarter we celebrated the grand opening of a new factory in Suzhou, China, for our single use bio-production technologies. As you know, we already have a well-established lab products operation in Suzhou, and this expansion is our first bio-production facility in the Asia-Pacific region, which will help meet increasing demand there for biologics. Our teams in China have effectively managed through the pandemic while positioning the business for growth, and we were pleased to deliver 18% growth in China in Q3. The last part I want to highlight around the progress we are making across our business is tied to our unique value proposition. Our customers recognize that we stepped up in a major way to help them navigate the challenging environment and that's creating new opportunities to build on our already strong relationships. This is very evident in forming biotech as you know, and now increasingly so with healthcare and diagnostic customers as well. During this time, the advantage of our leading scale and depth of capabilities has never been more evident, and this will lead to share gain opportunities longer term. Before I turn to our guidance, I'll make a quick a comment on capital deployment. As you know, our capital deployment strategy is a combination of returning capital through buybacks and dividends and strategic M&A. In terms of our view on M&A, we continue to have an active deal pipeline. We have a very strong balance sheet, and as always, we'll apply disciplined quiet approach the opportunities that meet our criteria for creating shareholder value. Turning to our guidance, there has obviously been a tremendous effort in supporting the COVID-19 response this year, and we've also executed well to grow our base business. This combination led to extraordinary growth and performance in Q3, and we expect that to continue to Q4. With that context, we expect to grow full-year 2020 revenue by 20% to approximately $30.5 billion, and we expect to grow our full-year 2020 adjusted EPS by 48% to $18.27 per share. Stephen will give you more of the details, but clearly, we are on track to achieve our truly spectacular year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a couple of takeaways. We continue to expand our leading role in responding to the pandemic, and we are having a profound impact on society. We are executing very well to capture new opportunities, gain market share, and drive growth across our businesses. Our efforts this year are significantly strengthening our company and positioning us very well for the long term. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. So, in terms of our Lab Products & Services businesses, all three of the businesses performed in the quarter. So that's pharma services, our CDMO activities, that's our customer channels group, and that's our lab products business, and we saw activity ramp up, as we did for the whole company, on the sort of normal business activity in the quarter, and at the same point, you're seeing two different types or three different types of COVID-related response embedded in those numbers. Clearly, the vaccine and therapy ramp up is happening, and you see that certainly in our pharma services business. You're also seeing very significant demand in our customer channels business for things like PPE as well as all the supplies you would use for COVID response. And then in our lab products business, we have very strong demand for our lab plastics as well as our cold storage equipment. As you know, we're a market leader in providing cold storage for laboratory use, and effectively, when you read about some of the vaccines needed cold storage across the supply chain we're getting very, very significant demand for those products. The basis is very good, right, so that's gone well, and then obviously on top of that you're seeing the benefits of those types of activity. Yes, so, Tycho, in terms of the demand for our PCR testing, it continues to be very strong, right, and if you think about it, gold standard performance in terms of accuracy, largest install base of instruments around the world, and we have supplied our customers and ramped up, and we have been the supplier that there's been no headaches really from a customer perspective through the pandemic. We have built our capacity ahead of demand consistently, and therefore customers have been happy, and know they can rely on us. Amplitude is an ultra-high throughput system, over 6,000 tests per day, and we're seeing very large demand. We've seen that demand from governments, we've seen that demand from reference labs and hospital systems, right. So it is a niche application but drives enormous volumes, right, because ultra-high throughput, so those labs, those governments that are really providing the support for high volume, given our supply reliability, the quality of our tests, and the dedication that we've had throughout the pandemic, that product will be a good growth driver. In terms of durability, we believe that PCR testing is going to continue to be very relevant to our customers because it gives you the most accurate information, and therefore we're comfortable with continuing with a strong level of demand in the fourth quarter, and we expect that those products are going to be relevant in 2021 because, unfortunately, the pandemic is still with us. Thanks, Tycho. Yes, so, Vijay, thanks for the question, and it's exciting to be able to set a new bar on performance, right. So that's been an interesting time for sure. In terms of our guidance, the way that we think about the fourth quarter is base business similar to what we saw in Q3 to a little bit better, and what's assumed in there, and it's an assumption, it's not based on customer feedback, is that year-end spend is softer than it was last year, and we're well positioned to meet it if higher demand, if customers have the funding, and our logic to that was it's a little bit early to know. It's a conservative assumption, and we don't want to disappoint. So if the funding is strong you know that, like we did in these last few quarters or many years actually, if the money is out there we're going to go out and get it, right. So that's the view on the base business, of low to mid single digit growth. When you look at the $1.75 billion, we see very strong demand right now for our COVID response. We're seeing a continued build in our vaccine and therapy role, and we are also seeing very strong demand for our testing solutions as well. You have less visibility into the month of December. So we have much better visibility, obviously, in October and November, and we just made an assumption that levels were going to be pretty similar to what we saw in the third quarter, and we came in at $1.75 billion. I wouldn't over-read into why $1.75 billion versus $2 billion, it's just that we have visibility for a couple of months, and December we have less visibility, but nonetheless it seems like demand should be strong. Yes, so in terms of our role for vaccines and therapeutics, we said over the balance of this year, '21, and '22 it's about $1 billion, and than number continues to grow, so I'd call it a $1 billion-plus at this point. We're active in a significant number of projects, something in the range of over 250 projects on therapies and vaccines, and our role is quite broad, it's not just pharma services, it's bioproduction, biosciences, and -- so that will be a -- is contributing to our revenue, but will contribute more certainly as the fourth quarter, and into the next year progresses. Thanks, Vijay. Yes, so, Steve, thanks for the questions. So, in terms of the academic and government, good to see the return to growth, clearly more customers came back to work, ramping up research activities, and that actually was a global phenomenon; we saw that across all three of the regions, and they all happened at different paces, but it's good to see that. When I made the comments at the very beginning of my remarks, really the funding environment I'm thinking about is the midterm, right, it's [technical difficulty] -- what I mean by that is there's such interest now in infectious disease, the pandemic, the importance, like in the U.S., of how NIH has played a huge role here. Those things are going to really, for the midterm, be very positive on a funding environment. Even short-term we're seeing quite a bit of interest from governments, and then obviously academic institutions, their own situation is probably much more impacted by their own economics, so that's going to be somewhat of a headwind, but that historically has been a low to mid single-digit growth market, and it's good to see we're already back to low single-digit growth there. Well, Steve, in terms of the role of testing, obviously managing in a pandemic is around social distancing, mask-wearing, good hygiene, and all of those things, and testing is a valuable supplemental tool to that, and we're seeing more and more demand for testing in those applications as well for kind of return-to-life is what we call it, which is really work in school, and things like the Amplitude is going to be able to support both medical applications as well as screening. You get a very high throughput, it's very economic, and therefore customers can get results quite rapidly, and therefore it plays a role, and what you're getting with PCR is extreme levels of accuracy versus some of the other technologies out there, which also will play a role, but you are trading accuracy, and depending on what the application is that's something that there certain applications doesn't make a lot of sense for. Operator, we'll take the next one. Yes, Derik, good morning. So in terms of the $2 billion, the majority is the testing related portion of that, and when you think about the testing portion it's actually quite expansive, right. So the single largest piece of that is going to be on our proprietary COVID-19 TaqPath kits, PCR kits, but we also have significant revenue from instrumentation and lab-developed tests. So that's kind of the PCR ecosystem with all of the very substantial sample prep that we provide across the industry as well. We really have built tremendous momentum there. On top of that, our viral transport media business has grown very rapidly, so Q3 was a nice step up from Q2, and we expect that to continue to grow, and that is a key part of the specimen collection, sample collection and transport to a lab, and so that we'll continue to build, and we announced that we're opening up a new facility in Scotland. We broke ground on that, be able to start producing viral transport media at the end of the year to start the European market, beyond the two facilities in Europe that already do that. So that continues to be important. From the next aspect, which is probably the smallest aspect at this point, which is PPE, as you would expect there was clearly -- that's all through our channel business. There was very elevated prices in the beginning of the pandemic as there was massive supply constraints. Volume has still be high, pricing has come down, and so, therefore while there's a moderate level of activity a lot of volume at a lower price, and that's good from a societal standpoint. It's good to see suppliers catching up with demand, and then from the -- probably the fastest-growing and building is our broad role in kind of, I'll say, vaccines and therapies, and I'm going to define it broadly because I think that sometimes because we have the most comprehensive position in the industry that we don't get clearly compared to the right activity. So the way to think about it, and Stephen was articulating it, there's what we provide to the manufacturers of a vaccine or a therapy, and historically you'd look at that as bioproduction, and that would be our leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technology, and our rapidly growing position in purification resins. At the same point, our biosciences business actually has a very meaningful role in that as well through the enzyme and nucleotide production, and we're doing very substantial expansions of capacity to support those needs as well. So, that's one set of activity. The second set of the activity is obviously around our pharma services business, and you would see that in our sterile fill-finish network, where you do the filling of a vaccine or a biologic, but you also see that in our drug substance or biologics plants, and even with some of the antivirals that are small molecules, you can see them in our API facility. So, we're incredibly well-positioned in a very skill way to serve the vaccine and therapy opportunities, and you're already starting to see that build, and that will continue to build in Q4 and into next year. So, in terms of the revenue, the really strong sequential improvement in revenue for Q3 versus Q2, the answer there is our orders are growing much faster than the revenue. So, we're actually building backlog. So, I don't think it is much of shifting from Q2 to Q3, just customer activity is really been picking up. You see that most quickly in our life science mass spec business and chromatography business. That business returned to growth in the quarter from a revenue perspective, and bookings were stronger than that. So, that's very encouraging, and then, as you would expect on the flip side, those areas that are very economically sensitive like chemical analysis, that's lagging, right, improved substantially, but lagging relative to the life sciences mass spec, and we have from a install base of sample prep and qPCR, we're shipping in a quarter what we would normally ship in a year. So, it doesn't give you the exact number, but it gives you the sense of the magnitude of how big that's been. You are welcome. Yes. So, Doug, what I can say is that on the first one, I have to be 100%, right on the answer, right, if it's either up down or flat, then I... [Multiple speakers] -- 100% accuracy on. So, those are two great questions, right? So, if I think about things that are building, clearly the broadly, you know, position and bioproduction, our pharma services business or biosciences nucleotide, that's all building, right? So, and then that's better than three or four weeks ago. It doesn't -- as you know, these things are very long cycle, they're moving at a much faster pace, but it takes a while for these products to get through the clinical process with approvals, and looking for efficacy. So, we see that building, and that's good for us in terms of what the outlook is. In terms of -- you know, unfortunately every day and week that we're still living with the pandemic means that things like testing are likely to be more durable, right? So that, you know, even six weeks or so after the analyst meeting, we're really in the same boat with actually more cases in Europe and a lot of increases in the pandemic. That usually adds to the view that there's going to be more durability to this going into '21, but we'll know more as we get into the year. So, in terms of the longer-term investments, a great question, right, the way to think about it is, we're investing significantly, you know $700 million is almost what we normally put in capital in the year roughly, right, so it's additional. We are it doing quickly, right. If you think about the pace that we are actually bringing facilities online gives you sense of the power of the PPI Business System. Pretty much everything that you are seeing we are going to repurpose longer term to other markets that are not pandemic-related, right, and some of them are very easy to visualize, right, which is think about start for finish, we have commitments for the expansions that we have done for vaccines and therapies, and we are also already getting commitments from customers -- large customers that basically say when that demand is freed up, we want to put other products in that demand, right.\n it's:Doug Schenkel: Okay, and I'll leave it there, and let others ask other questions. Thank you very much. Thanks Doug. Stephen, you want to talk a little bit about that? And Steve, another way we have a say lots of discussions with our customers. It's a little tacky right now to say, so what is your yearend budget going to look like. It's just not a topic that is where you are focused on which is -- so not helping you, right, and this is not a normal year. So, I think that's a good place to start again for the quarter. Growth is very strong, stronger than the historically strong performance, and orders were significantly stronger than that strong growth, so very, very high level of order growth which you would expect, right. We play a major role in the therapies and vaccines broadly in all classes of disease, and we are playing a significant role in COVID. So, we are seeing very strong demand for our capabilities. Thanks Steve. It seems pretty steady. I mean if think about manufacturing across the industry not our customers, has been smooth sailing through this period of time, right. Companies have been able to produce their medicines and develop their products for -- through the development process. So, we haven't seen COVID-related disruptions on the manufacturing side of biotech and pharmaceutical. It continues to grow very substantially. So, obviously there is going to be some diversion of short-term resources. So, maybe two or three years from now there is some project that has been theoretically less than what it could have been because of COVID work, but I think that's very much in the noise level, because if I look at things like new quotations and new activities, it's extraordinary high and our development work, clinical trials work. So, I think it's very good. Thanks Dan. Operator, we are going to take just one more. Hi, Jack. Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. R&D spend was up about 20% in the quarter. So, we're investing substantially. It's really about adding more talent is the step that we are doing, and then working on some key areas that -- where demand actually has been a little bit softer. So, what we are doing is kind of doubling down the investment to position ourselves for strong growth for the long term. Very much the exact playbook we did in the financial crisis where we had a very high focus on investing in R&D so that we would bounce back out of the downturn quickly, and we did, and so we are doing that same playbook in certain areas and returns will show up in the next couple of years is the way to think about it. Thank you, Jack, for the question, and let me wrap up with a couple of things, first that we are certainly proud of our role in helping our customers and society during this time. We are going to continue to manage the company appropriately to come out of this period and even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress at yearend. I hope that you stay safe, and as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone."

So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 second quarter call. What an incredible quarter we just had. When we gave our update during our Q1 call, we provided our best thinking on our Q2 expectations in an environment no one had ever seen before. We were prepared for the most difficult quarter we've seen in the 18 years I've been with Thermo Fisher, and we successfully navigated the environment to deliver truly extraordinary performance. Our teams did a remarkable job of helping our customers respond to the pandemic. Their tireless effort and determination drove very strong results, generating material COVID-19 tailwinds, while minimizing the impact of customer disruption created by lockdowns around the world. Our performance in Q2 put a spotlight on the talent of our team, the advantage of our industry-leading scale and depth of capabilities, and the importance of our role in supporting our customers and society. We continuously built on our strengths. And what we've accomplished in the past few months shows that Thermo Fisher can perform extremely well, even in the most difficult circumstances. I know I\u2019ll always think back on this period as among our most -- our finest moments as a team and as a company. I look forward to covering some of the many highlights of the quarter with you this morning. So, I'll start with our financial results, which exceeded our expectations across the board. As you saw in our press release, our reported revenue increased 10% in Q2 year-over-year to $6.92 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 26% to $1.86 billion. And our adjusted operating margin increased to 27% in Q2, which was 350 basis points of expansion. Finally, we grew adjusted EPS by 28% to $3.89 per share in the quarter. We delivered such outstanding financial performance in Q2 because we worked with speed at scale, and quickly mobilized our resources to help our customers respond to the pandemic across the globe. Our solutions met their needs, generating approximately $1.3 billion of COVID revenue tailwinds. Our teams also did an excellent job of mitigating the headwinds in other parts of our Company. And we managed the Company aggressively and appropriately in a very fluid environment to set ourselves up for an even brighter future. Turning to our performance by end markets. Let me start with an overall comment for context. As you know, the pandemic has generated both, significant headwinds and tailwinds in our industry. And this impacted each of our end markets to varying degrees. On one hand, we saw greatly reduced customer activity due to work disruptions; and on the other, we benefited significantly from our COVID-19 response. We managed the Company very effectively through this dynamic to deliver an exceptional quarter. So, starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets. It was another great quarter and we continued to perform very well here in Q2, growing just under 10%. We had particularly strong performance in our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Turning to industrial and applied. We saw a decline of just over 10% in Q2, while in academic and government we declined approximately 20%. Customers in these two end markets were significantly affected by business disruptions during the quarter due to the pandemic. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare. While we saw significant headwinds in this market due to a decrease in doctor visits and related testing, we met the incredible demand for COVID-19 testing and were able to deliver growth of just over 70% in Q2. We're providing customers with our proprietary diagnostic test kits, instrumentation and viral transport media, as well as reagents used for laboratory developed tests. And I'll talk more about our involvement later in my remarks. To wrap up our end market commentary, our teams put forth an amazing effort supporting our customers and meeting the societal response of the pandemic, while effectively managing the Company to deliver outstanding growth in Q2. Turning to the business highlights for the quarter. On our Q1 call, I departed from my typical agenda bit and talked about the three guiding principles we're following to manage through these unprecedented times. To remind you, the first is ensuring the safety of our colleagues; our second guiding principle is to maintain business continuity, so we can continue to support our customers, whether they're directly responding to the pandemic or continuing their work more broadly; and third, we manage our Company appropriately, so we come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. As I reflect on Q2, those guiding principles have served us very well. We've successfully implemented numerous safety protocols at our sites that has kept our business running so we can continue to serve our customers at a time when they need us most. Let me focus today on the last guiding principle, managing the Company appropriately. And to reiterate, it's a combination of relentless focus on executing a long-term growth strategy while ensuring that we successfully navigate the short-term challenges and generate new opportunities as well. During this time, we've been carefully managing costs while confidently investing to position the business for long-term share gain and accelerated growth. This includes continuing to invest in key R&D programs, even in parts of the business where demand is temporarily impacted. For example, we had a great showing at the virtual American Society of Mass Spectrometry conference in June, where we launched two new Orbitrap Exploris instruments to advance biotherapeutic research. These types of investments across our businesses will position us well to capture the opportunities as customer activity returns to more normal levels. The second quarter reinforced why we're recognized as a world leader in serving science. I've been overwhelmed by the outreach we've had from the most senior government officials around the globe, to the leaders of healthcare institutions, to the top executives of the world's largest companies. They\u2019re all navigating challenges never experienced before, whether they're protecting the safety of their own workforce or communities managing the incredible volume of testing with trying to understand the virus, to identify therapies and accelerate the development of vaccines. We are in the best position to help them meet these challenges because we remain focused on executing our growth strategy by continuously innovating, leveraging our scale and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. We're involved in virtually every aspect of the pandemic response from providing research tools, to personal protective equipment, to diagnostics, as well as supporting the development and production of therapies and vaccines. Our mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer, and it highlights the critical role we play. This morning, I'm going to focus on the two most prominent aspects of our involvement, diagnostic testing, and the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics. First, testing. It was an exceptional quarter for us, given the role we play in COVID-19 diagnostics. We created a major business line in a few months and have continued to expand our capabilities. I'll cover just some of the highlights. As you know, our industry-leading PCR franchise has always played a role in our customers' ability to provide lab developed tests. And our reagents and consumables support many COVID-19 tests in use around the world. But our role significantly expanded when we received regulatory approvals back in March for our TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Our PCR-based workflow is widely used in 50 countries. And these tests are considered the gold standard, given their high level of accuracy. April was all about ramping up manufacturing and helping getting our customers to get their labs ready to handle the significant volume of testing. Our teams rapidly scaled production at an incredible pace, and we ended the quarter with enough capacity to produce more than 10 million tests per week, should our customers need that level of testing. Our field services team and application specialists did a remarkable job of getting our customers ramped up to COVID-19 testing. In May, we received an expanded emergency use authorization or EUA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allowed more of our PCR instruments to run these tests to help address the huge demand. The EUA also provided more options for reagents and consumables, which provides customers with greater flexibility in testing workflow. The overwhelming demand for testing created significant strain on the industry's supply of sample collection materials. The swabs, vials and media needed to effectively collect and transport the specimen to a testing lab for processing. The U.S. government came to us for help. And given our understanding of the challenge, we worked with them to significantly ramp up production of highly specialized viral transport media or VTM, to address this need. VTM is critical to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 test results, and must be manufactured and dispensed into vials in an aseptic environment. We designed and built a new factory in Lenexa, Kansas in about six weeks, and we produced our first VTM vials at this new facility on the July 4, the exact date we set out in our ambitious project plan. This was a very exciting accomplishment for our teams. Whether it was in Lenexa or all of the other ramp-up projects related to COVID, our industry-leading scale and the power of our PPI business system were key enablers in achieving these milestones in such a short period of time, while managing enormous complexity and meeting all the regulatory requirements. Looking forward, in addition to our PCR-based TaqPath kit, which determines if a patient has an active infection, we plan on launching additional tests. We're developing a serological test that can tell if a patient has ever been exposed to the virus. And in addition, we're developing a respiratory panel to help doctors determine whether a person has COVID-19 or different respiratory disease. And our goal is to launch this panel as of the flu season. We're working through the regulatory processes to make both of these tests available to customers globally. The other significant aspect of our involvement is the work we're doing to support our pharma and biotech customers in the ways to launch COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. As you know, we're a leader in the development and production of vaccines, antivirals and other therapies through our pharma services business. And we're currently working on more than 200 COVID-related projects globally. We're leveraging our global network to support governments and customers as they accelerate these projects, including some that are undergoing human clinical trials, by providing critical capacity and expertise to get new products to market and ultimately to patients. To give you one example, we're playing a key role in the U.S. government's pandemic countermeasure program, managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA. We received funding to support the expansion of our manufacturing capacity for sterile injectables, which can be used to fill a high volume of vaccine doses. In addition, we're expanding capacity for customers who are developing COVID-19 therapies, including promising antivirals to compress timelines to meet the expected surge in demand. While we continue to increase our support of the pandemic response, we're also expanding our pharma services capacity globally to ensure that we can deliver critical medicines for treating a range of serious health conditions. I'll highlight two examples from the quarter. One is the new site we're building in Plainville, Massachusetts, which will essentially double our viral vector manufacturing capacity. This is another in our series of expansions in the U.S. that will help us meet demand for the development and production of gene therapies. The other development is our strategic partnership with CSL, the global biotech company to help to meet high demand for biologics. We will support CSL's product portfolio by leveraging our entire network, including drug development, production, packaging and clinical trials. And under a long-term agreement, we will also take over CSL's state-of-the-art biologics facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, which is currently under construction and expected to be completed in the 2021. This site will feature both, high-volume stainless steel and highly flexible single-use bioproduction technologies, and our plan is just to expand its use to support a number of customers. All of these strategic investments will ensure that we can deliver on our value proposition for pharma and biotech customers through a powerful combination of expertise, flexibility and scale. Turning now to capital deployment, I'll make a couple of comments on pending acquisition of Qiagen. As you saw in our press release last Thursday, we announced that we renegotiated certain aspects of our acquisition agreement. Given the considerable changes in industry dynamics since we originally announced the transaction in early March, we revised our offer. Qiagen is making a significant contribution to the global pandemic response, and we believe our new all-cash offer of \u20ac43 per share, reflects the full and fair value of the business in the current environment, while generating strong returns for both sets of shareholders. We're very excited about this transaction. We look forward to bringing together our complementary offerings to help our customers fight the ongoing pandemic and combat other infectious diseases and emerging health needs. For our shareholders, we expect strong returns and believe that the accretion will be slightly more favorable than what we articulated in early March. While there is still much of work to be done over the next several months, we're on track with the regulatory process and expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021. Qiagen is an excellent fit for our Company, and we're excited about the new opportunities we'll have following the close. Now, I'll make a quick comment on guidance. As you know, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance in early April due to the uncertainty around the pandemic and its potential impact on our customers. Now, here we are in late July, and it's obviously still a very uncertain time. Similar to Q1, while we're not ready to reinstate annual guidance, we want to provide you with as much color as possible on our expectations for the current quarter. Stephen will review the specifics in his remarks, including our organic growth expectations and key assumptions for Q3. Before I turn the call to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We're playing a significant role in helping our customers to respond to the pandemic and making a huge impact on society. Our teams are managing the business very well through this unprecedented time to mitigate the headwinds and create new opportunities. We're continuing to execute our growth strategy to position Thermo Fisher for an even brighter future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by framing our Q2 organic growth performance. As Marc mentioned, we had an outstanding quarter and we grew organically 11%. I think, it is best to break the growth into two elements. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds that we generated during the quarter; and the second is the performance of the rest of our business, including share gain and market growth, as well as the headwinds from COVID-19 caused by disruptions to customer activity. We estimate that the tailwinds from COVID-19 were approximately $1.3 billion or 21% of growth in the quarter, largely driven by testing-related kits and instruments. The tailwinds were significantly stronger than we originally expected, driven by the increased scale and duration of the pandemic, and the speed at which we were able to ramp up our response and extend our relevant offerings to our customers. The rest of the business, excluding the COVID-19 tailwinds performed just about the high end of our initial range of expectations for the quarter. The team executed really well to serve all of our customers throughout Q2. The result is that we delivered outstanding top-line growth in the quarter. We are able to manage the Company very effectively during a period of significant economic disruption and translate that top line growth into excellent bottom line growth. We appropriately managed the businesses with the strongest headwinds while maximizing the tailwind opportunities and continuing to invest for really bright future. All of this enabled us to deliver 26% growth in adjusted operating income and 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share, an excellent quarter overall. I'll now give you some more details of the second quarter results for the total Company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q2 earnings results. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS 28% to $3.89; GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.90, up 5% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 11% organic growth and the foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1%. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter. North America grew 10%, Europe grew in the high teens, Asia Pacific was flat with China down approximately 15%, and the Rest of the World grew 50%. Looking at our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 27%, 350 basis points higher than Q2 last year. We saw very strong volume contributions, positive business mix and continued productivity investments -- improvements driven by our PPI business system, including appropriate cost controls, given the headwinds from COVID-19. During the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in the businesses. This was the last quarter of impact from our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business, which we sold at the end of Q2 2019. The divestiture was approximately $0.02 diluted in the quarter and was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $50 million on revenue, $12 million on just the adjusted operating income and a negligible impact on adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, up 390 basis points from Q2 of the prior year. Gross margin expansion was driven by the same factors as our adjusted operating margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.9% of revenue, an increase of 50 basis points versus Q2 2019. Total R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 5.6%. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $129 million, $8 million higher than Q2 last year. Adjusted other income and expense was net income in the quarter of $16 million, similar to Q2 2019. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.5%, up 50 basis points versus Q2 last year. And average diluted shares were 398 million in Q2, 5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations was very strong in the first half of the year, totaling $2.2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $500 million. We returned approximately $85 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 16% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and $21.3 billion of total debt as we prepare for the financing of the Qiagen acquisition. During the quarter, we raised \u20ac1.2 billion through the issuance of euro-denominated senior notes. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. And wrapping up my comments on our total Company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 12.5%, up 110 basis points from Q2 last year, as we continue to generate very strong returns. So, now, I\u2019ll prove some color on the performance of our four business segments. I thought it'd be helpful to start with a couple of framing comments around the impact of segment results. The complexity here shows the breadth of our response to meet the needs of our customers at this critical time. From a revenue standpoint in Q2, approximately three quarters of the COVID-19 tailwinds are reflected in Life Sciences Solutions. That includes testing related kits, instruments and sample preparations. This is recognized in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses.  The Specialty Diagnostics segments include the revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized sales of viral transport media and the microbiology business, as well as sales of tests and PPEs by the healthcare market channel. The Laboratory Products and Services segment also includes revenue from sales of PPE recorded in the research and taking market channels. In addition, this segment includes testing workflow-related plastics made by our lab products business, and vaccine and therapy development and production support from our pharma services business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments. The impact depended on the mix of revenue tailwinds and headwinds, as well as the different levels of pull through on that revenue mix. Across the Company, we used our PPI business system to manage cost appropriately given the uncertain environment, and that had a positive impact in each segment. At the same time, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in our businesses, even in those where COVID-19 was a net headwind. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition, as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. We were able to do this given the strength of the Company's overall performance. Those investments do not necessarily match with the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds and headwinds in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported margins in the segments. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment standpoint but all reflective of very active management of the Company, allowing us to navigate successfully through unprecedented times and positioning us really well for the future. So, moving on to the segment detail, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 52% and organic revenue growth was 55%, driven by exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business as well as continued strong growth in bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 103% and adjusted operating margin was 47.4%, up 12 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity as positive business mix and continued to make significant strategic investments across the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 21% in Q2 and organic revenue decline of 20%. COVID-19 disruption to our customers continues to have a significant impact to the business in this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 53% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, down 870 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity driven by our PPI activities, which was more than offset by volume headwinds, business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments. As a reminder, this is the segment that previously included the anatomical pathology business, which we sold in June last year. In Q2, reported revenue increased by 5%, organic revenue growth was 12%. Some of the businesses in this segment were significantly impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds in the quarter. This was as a result of decrease in doctor visits and related testing. Most impacted were the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. That said, this segment also saw a significant COVID-19-related tailwinds in the quarter. We saw very strong growth in our healthcare market channel and our clinical diagnostics and microbiology businesses. Adjusted operating income decreased 12%, which included a 5% headwind from the divestiture. Adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, down 410 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw a strong volume leverage in productivity. However, this was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q2 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 5%. In the quarter, growth within the segment was led by our pharma services. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q2 decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 10.1%, which was lower than the prior year by 300 basis points. In the quarter, we saw a strong productivity and volume leverage. So, this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic and related customer impact continues to evolve. And as a result, we're still not in a position to provide full year detailed guidance. However, as we did last quarter, I will provide you with some color on how we're viewing organic growth for the coming quarter as well as certain full year 2020 assumptions to help you in your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. There are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3. I will outline of the factors to consider when thinking about our potential growth for the coming quarter. As was the case last quarter, there are two key variables that would drive our growth in Q3. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds; the second is the headwind caused by COVID-19-related disruption to our customers\u2019 activity. Regarding the revenue tailwinds, clearly there is a wide range of outcomes here. But, our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 is approximately $1.1 billion of revenue, which would translate to just under 18% of growth. The volume of COVID-19 testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor, determining the expense of our revenue tailwinds in Q3. Regarding the rest of our revenue growth, which is a combination of the COVID-19-related headwinds, underlying market growth, and our share gain activity, we estimate this will be in the range of approximately flat to negative 5% in Q3. This compares to negative 10% in Q2. The improvement quarter-over-quarter is driven by an assumed gradual ramp in customer activity. As they return more fully to the workplace. It's important to note that the range does not anticipate to return to the lockdowns seen at the height of the pandemic. So, when you put all this together, as I mentioned our current best estimate of Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. Given the fluidity of the situation, there are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3 with testing demand being the most significant swing factor. I will now move on to an update of some of the modeling elements for the full year. With regards to FX, in 2020, we\u2019re now assuming that this is a year-over-year headwind on revenue of $200 million or just under 1%. There's $0.06 of dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, which reflects revenue and operating income headwinds of $105 million and $30 million, respectively. We\u2019re continuing to assume that the acquisitions we completed in 2019 will contribute approximately $160 million to our reported revenue growth in 2020. As a reminder, on the calendar, it was one less day in Q1 and there will be two extra days in Q4 this year. We continue to expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $460 million. This includes the Qiagen acquisition pre-funding completed to-date. In 2020, that equates to a cost of $90 million or $0.17 to adjusted earnings per share. We will continue to look at opportunities to prefund more of the transaction during the remainder of 2020. We continue to assume that adjusted other net income will be about $70 million for the year. And with regards to net capital expenditures, we now expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. This includes approximately $300 million of capital expenditure to support our COVID-19 response. In terms of capital deployment, we completed $1.5 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and are assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We estimate that full year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. And we continue to assume that we\u2019ll return approximately $350 million for capital to shareholders this year through dividends. So to wrap up, as you can see from our outstanding performance in Q2, we continue to manage the Company extremely effectively in a very dynamic environment. With that I'll turn the call back over to Ken.\nKenneth Apicerno: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I appreciate you guys kind of quantifying the COVID tailwinds. I think, as we look a little bit further out in securities market, how you think about the durability on the COVID testing side? You noted the PCR test is now approved and other instruments. You talked about the respiratory panel. So, can you talk a little bit about is that a move forward more automated systems, rolling it into the syndromic panel? And do you need to build out more of a panel for example, into the physician office market? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. Tycho, thanks for the question. As I look to the COVID -- impact of COVID going forward, the largest determinant this year and the impact is going to be related to the testing demand. And certainly, as you get into 2021, you're going to see a larger and larger impact of the activities we do in our pharma services business to support the therapy and vaccine development and ramp up, or we get some of that now. When I look at the going forward for COVID-19 testing, we obviously have a leading position in PCR platform. Around the world, our response has been a very significant ramp-up in capacity. And we anticipate that the demand certainly in Q3 will continue to be at a very strong level. And, most of us are obviously very dominated by U.S. headlines, but what you see is generally demand picking up further in the U.S. but you also see demand weakening in other geographies. Europe, we have lower demand as you saw in Q2. That may change. But the net of it is fairly similar revenues to what we saw in Q2 is what we're expecting for Q3.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then, two follow-ups on Patheon. You had the press release out the other day quantifying 200 programs you're involved with. Can you just help us think about the trial delay headwinds versus the tailwinds on vaccine development for the next couple of quarters? How we should think about the trajectory for Patheon? And then, separately on China down 15%, was that in line with your expectations? Obviously, you've been on the path to recovery. So, that was a little bit worse than these models? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, in terms of the pharma services activity, we're very involved with a very large number of programs. And when I look at sort of the headwinds from the pandemic on clinical trials, outside of the COVID, there was some, but not meaningful. And when I look to China at a high level, we saw demand build throughout the quarter, in terms of where we were. And the way that I would think about is, China was very, very conservative on the opening up of academic institutions. So, that actually was a little bit more muted than what we would have expected back in April. But it's picking up in Q3. It looks to be more encouraging. Thank you, Tycho. \nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe to follow up on the prior question. Marc, can you perhaps size what the vaccine opportunity could mean for the overall life science industry? I understand, at some point, diagnostics could drop off. We've heard a multibillion dollar figure for the industry. I'm just curious on -- just given the scale of the vaccine opportunity we\u2019re thinking, should that perhaps be over time larger than the diagnostic opportunity?\nMarc Casper: When I think about the vaccine opportunity, what's a little bit hard to quantify is what's the vaccine strategy going to be used around the world? So, I'm talking more what's the total amount of vaccine going to be produced? Are we thinking about the world getting high-risk population, are we thinking about the just the countries that can afford a vaccine, or we thinking about 7 billion people ultimately getting a vaccine? And that leads to a massively wide range of what the outcomes are. What I would expect, should there be a successful vaccine, is that, the role of a company like Thermo Fisher and certainly the CDMO industry more generally will play a significant role, based on the fact that the ramp-up under every scenario would be very dramatic. We've been very-active in those projects and many of the high-profile projects that you read about. We are either providing raw materials from our bioproduction or biosciences business to having roles in the production ultimately of what I'll call drug substance or vaccine substance in certain cases, and certainly a very meaningful role in the sterile fill-finish with a final packaging form that a vaccine would be administered. So, we expect if a vaccine is successful that it will be a meaningful tailwind over time with revenue that we've already gotten a little bit of and ramp slowly through the balance of this year and would be more meaningful in 2021-2022 should the vaccine be successful.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then, one on margin, in the guidance for the back half. I think, you guys mentioned, perhaps the organization was prepped up for a pretty drastic outcome. So, clearly, you had outsized volume benefits. So, when you think about the incremental margins for back half, should we think about some of that spend coming back perhaps in the incremental margins, maybe tempering down a little bit? And I'm curious why perhaps we don't have an EPS floor, even if we assume Q4 to be all of the diagnostics tailwinds. So, it still seems the EPS projections here should be pretty strong. Thank you.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, Vijay, I'll take that one. So, when you think about Q2, 11% organic growth drove 28% growth in adjusted EPS. So, it's a very strong performance. So you think about Q3, and most likely outcome based on what we\u2019re thinking right now is 15% organic growth and that would drive very strong adjusted EPS as well. I think about Q3 to Q2, kind of the change in the mix of the business in the 15% versus the 11%. It's likely to be slightly less favorable business mix within that revenue. Obviously, this is scenario where that mix could play out to better, but I think that's a good place, a good way to think about modeling for Q3.\nVijay Kumar: And then, on the EPS floor perhaps, even if we assume all of diagnostics just went away for Q4, I feel like EPS should be certainly in the double-digit range for the year, perhaps in the mid-teens. Is that a reasonable assumption now for the year?\nMarc Casper: So, we chose not to give the full year guidance because when you think about the potential mix and range of growth in each segment, to give a raise that would be useful, the number would be enormously wide. So, what we are looking at is, as we get more predictability into what the world looks like, especially in Q4 where you don't know what the virus looks like, you could have a very bullish scenario. You could actually have a pessimistic scenario, if there was a dramatic -- this current wave gets much worse, you could be more pessimistic. So, we're keeping our thinking on what the right external approach is. We feel good about our outline for Q3. And I think you've got a sense from our Q2 performance, we're going to deliver an outstanding year financially and it'll be managing through whatever environment is thrown at us, we're going to create great opportunities to drive share gains, top-line growth and extraordinary earnings performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions. I think the first one is, I appreciate the color on Q3. I think, where we're getting most of our incoming questions for investors is how do we think about the COVID testing tailwinds going on into \u201821? I mean, Qiagen has put out commentary, talking about double-digit growth in their business, but then decline in 2022 numbers, if you look at the documents filed this morning. I guess, could you just sort of talk about how we do this? Because we obviously -- if you think about modeling for \u201821, I know it's given testing coming down, vaccine production going up like that. But, I think that that's sort of where the bulk of my incoming questions are from people.\nMarc Casper: So, Derik, thanks for the question. Let me tell you how we're planning. That's probably -- it's impossible to predict in a certain way. It feels like a month as far as these days. But, what we're expecting from everything we know is that we're going to be living with the pandemic for a number of quarters. It'll take time for a vaccine to be in the market if it's successful. Well, therapies are making progress again that these will take time and that the virus continues to spread in many countries around the world. So, that this is not a, it's done quickly scenario. And therefore, we're expecting that 2021, we\u2019ll be navigating through both, headwinds of disruptions of some sort related to the pandemic, but also the continued societal response needed to that. And we think we're incredibly well-positioned, based on our quality, scalability of manufacturing and very large installed base and very exquisite customer relationships. We feel good about that will play a meaningful role in 2021 for the testing volumes that are needed by customers. And what that number is going to be, is a very, very enormous range of outcomes. But our manufacturing teams have been remarkable and the power of our PPI business system has been astonishing. And if you think back, when I was at the White House at the end of April, I said that we're working our way to be able to produce 10 million kits a week. And that was late April. And by the end of the quarter, our manufacturing capacity is about that. And that doesn't mean we're selling them any because demand will ebb and flow, but our ability to scale and meet whatever response is out there, we feel highly confident in that.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. And could you talk a little bit more about the academic outlook? I mean, you've got a fairly big chunk of your business tied to academic and university and colleges. And clearly there's a lot of uncertainty to deal with this resurgence about how these are going to open. Can you walk us through academic and government as we look at U.S, Europe, APAC and just to get a sense on what your customers are planning and how labs are, -- how many of your labs you still closed? Just I think some general color. I think that's the other number one -- that's the other big incoming question we have from investors.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, in terms of academic and government end market, you obviously saw disruptions around the world at the beginning of the pandemic with activity very quickly ramping down. As you look at Western Europe, which actually started to strengthen steadily throughout the quarter. The U.S. which faced the pandemic slightly later than Europe is a little behind, but on the same type of trajectory with activity picking up. The interesting country has really been China, was -- actually kept most of its universities closed for most of the quarter. That activity is picking up as well, but actually a little bit more slowly than one would anticipate -- one would have anticipated. So the impact of that is obviously, they weren\u2019t customers able to receive instruments as easily as normal. And so, we would expect that as academic and government customers reopen in that setting, you'll see instruments demand start to pick up as well.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. I'll get back into Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. \nMarc Casper: Good morning.\nJack Meehan: Marc, I was curious to get your take on how much the tailwind and share gains that you're seeing in the business right now. Do you think we're going to end up proving to be more permanent over time versus kind of the outsized benefit you're seeing right now? And I know it's difficult to provide a three-year view when we don't have a one year view. But just given all the moving parts, how do you think your position versus the 5% to 7% target you laid out a year ago?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack, when the team\u2019s view, right, when we were sitting in February and looking at the situation in China, the team's view was having a very clear set of guiding principles, right, which was the obvious. Keep your colleagues safe, support your customers activity, and the third is manage the Company appropriately in this environment. And we came with a very clear view of what that meant, which is, of course, manage costs tightly because there's going to be disruption to demand, but be very aggressive to position the Company for a brighter future to solidify and strengthen and hopefully even increase the growth outlook of the Company for the longer term. Normal for us is 5% to 7% growth, and we've been taking actions to create an even brighter future. So, we need to get higher in that range when you're in a normal environment or above that range. And we have no idea now. But I know we're taking the actions to strengthen the long-term outlook of the Company. And because we've been able to respond so aggressively to help our customers navigate the pandemic, we're obviously in the midst of an incredibly strong year as well. So, we're -- at this point, obviously we had about 7% organic growth when you look at the first half, so at the high end of our normal range. And obviously with the Q3, this could be a very significant year as well in terms of performance.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then, I wanted to also follow up on Qiagen. Clearly unprecedented times, so I can appreciate the justification for the price increase. There have been some questions around whether \u20ac43 is enough. So, I was just hoping you could comment on your appetite or lack thereof to raise the price further? And just walk us through what happens next in the tender process.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. As everybody here knows, we're extraordinarily disciplined in terms of our capital deployment strategy and ensuring that where we deploy our capital, we're going to strengthen the Company strategically and generate strong returns for our shareholders. The dynamics are obviously, as you said, very different, from the beginning of March to now. And Qiagen has done a good job in terms of stepping up and making a real impact on society from a pandemic response. And we thought our way through that and had very good negotiations with Qiagen and came to an agreement at the \u20ac43. And we believe that's the full and fair value. In terms of our view is, we were very clear in the process, and we disclosed that this morning, I think early hours because of the German regulations. That is our best and final offer. And the process is very straightforward. The tender I believe ends around August 10th. And if we clear the 66.67% threshold, then the tender is complete, so mechanism and the deal proceeds. And if we don't get to 66.67%, the deal is over, because there's a cooling off period in Germany. So, there is no revised offer. That is what it is. And, we think it's very appropriate for both sets of shareholders. And we look forward to completing the tender process and then moving forward through the regulatory process and welcoming over 5,000 new colleagues next year into the Company.\nJack Meehan: Makes sense. Thanks Marc.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And again, thanks to the Thermo team for all your efforts over the past several months. Just in terms of my first question, what end market expectations are embedded into your Q3 financial targets, excluding COVID-19 tailwinds?\nMarc Casper: It's not a way that we manage the business quite, Doug. Let me try to get you an answer more about activity levels in the non-COVID, and make some qualitative views around it. So, for Q2 Doug, the non-COVID related businesses declined 10%, right, which was just above what the better end of our expectations that we gave in the guidance process, right? So, that's where it ended. June was down about 5%. So, you saw, April, May were worse. June was about negative five. The range of outcomes that Stephen articulated in the outlook for Q3 was a range of negative 5 to flat. The negative 5 would assume that what we saw in June continues throughout the quarter. The flat basically is a steady improvement throughout the quarter. And when you think about that in normal quarter for us is 5% to 7% growth on that business, right? So, even at flat, you're still 5 to 7 points below what we would have experienced for the last five, seven years, right? So, it's a steady increase in activity is what is assumed. And when you look at that on the non-COVID-related businesses, pharma biotech has continued to be the least impacted and would likely be the least impacted, and academic and government, industrial and applied, and the healthcare, diagnostics, they all should start to see some level of step up throughout the quarter is the way I would think about it.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. That's super helpful. And building off of one thing you touched on there, Marc. I don't think, in your prepared remarks you commented on instrument versus consumable revenue growth in the quarter or the exit rates. Would you be willing to share any details on those data?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. That was very skewed by the tailwinds. When you think about tailwinds at large, they're going to be consumables right now. Excluding that, I clearly instrument purchases were at a lower level of growth than consumables and services. Customer activity has been relatively low. And we expect that to pick up in the second half of the year.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And one last one, really building off of some earlier questions, but trying to get a little more granular. Glaxo has talked about selling vaccines at about $10 per unit, which in their words is around cost. Pfizer this morning just agreed to sell to the U.S. at $19.50 [ph] per unit for their vaccine, which is, I think just a smidge above cost of [Technical Difficulty]. Is there a rule of thumb we can use on what percentage of unit pricing would typically be up for grab for Thermo, whether it's on a per unit vaccine basis or using services? I mean, just using that 10 to 19.50 range, how much of that would normally end up going to Thermo as a component of cost?\nMarc Casper: It's really extraordinarily different to do. Let me just visualize it for you, which is why I really can't give you an answer. If you think about the vaccine, I can give you two different views of how it gets administered in those cases. One is single unit, meaning one vial, one vaccine; another is a vial where you put a syringe and take out the vaccine and you have 10 or 20 units of the vaccine doses in the single thing. You're going to get wildly different CDMO revenue or our revenue based on just even the filling strategy of those companies. So, very hard to do a rule of thumb until you know exactly the dosage form and so forth. And, is it -- what's the technology used in the vaccine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi. Thanks Marc. And congrats on the quarter and impressive quarter here for sure. And thanks for your commitment to both, research and improving the lives here with COVID testing and commitment to vaccines. So, first one, if I could ask on capital deployment, given the COVID benefits you're seeing on testing and the growth you expect to see from vaccines, what is your thinking, long-term thinking on capital deployment, given that the vaccines scenario is actually multiyear, as you pointed out? Are you thinking about capital deployment any differently than before?\nMarc Casper: So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, from a capital deployment strategy, I don't think it really changes too much. What I would say is, over the longer period of time, it's going to be a blend return of capital and the majority being redeployed into M&A in the business. If you think about the past quarter or March forward, obviously a large acquisition in Qiagen, also a nice bolt-on acquisition, which we announced and will close next year in CSL\u2019s biologics facility. And I think, you'll see us do a cadence of smaller and larger deals over time with a steady return of capital. So, our business is performing at a high level. Our expectations for the future is that it's going to perform at a high level. And that's going to give us very substantial cash flow to be able to redeploy.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. And we\u2019ve also increased that CapEx significantly to address capacity and capability enhancements for the COVID-19 response as well.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That's very helpful. And my second question is on, you have a unique vantage point, Marc and a global perspective, given Thermo's position and the scale and the speed that you pointed out to. As you look at research funding across the globe, there's an expectation here that the research funding is likely to grow. Magnitude is unknown at this point. But, could you give us a sense of that, given what you're seeing, given the magnitude of this crisis? What does this mean for the next five years across the life science tools industry? And more importantly for Thermo, when it relates to academic funding and research funding across the globe?\nMarc Casper: So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, as we talk to governments and we talk to our customers and we use our experience, life science tools and diagnostics and our pharma service capabilities, it's a fantastic industry with great market growth characteristics you see in the industry perform well in this environment. My expectation is when the dust settles, the commitment to life science research, healthcare infrastructure systems is going to be even better over time than what the strong period that we enjoyed. And we're seeing some of the early excitement of the importance of the work. And so, I'm very bullish about what the long-term benefit will be. Obviously, there's going to be ebbs and flows because of the economy and affordability and those things. But, if I think the long term perspective, I'm very optimistic for what our industry holds and for the strong competitive position that we\u2019ve built to serve in that industry.\nPuneet Souda: Great, thank you.\nKenneth Apicerno: Operator, we have time for just one more.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for letting me run the anchor leg here. I have a two-parter for Marc as it relates to a couple of subcategories within testing. And then, I have one on the financials for Stephen. Marc, there are a couple of potential drivers of testing prospectively for you and for the space broadly. One is screening. We've heard, just for example, a number of universities talk about reasonably high frequency testing of asymptomatic people on campuses. I wonder if you could speak to what extent asymptomatic screening is or is not in your plan, and whether you think there could be a material tailwind? And then, the second part of my testing question actually relates to serology. Serology did kind of quite as well as we hoped initially. It just doesn't seem to be finding as many instances as we had hoped for in the antibody signal of immunity. Can you speak to how you think that market evolves? Are there ways we could get the yields higher?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Steve, thanks for the question. In terms of screening or asymptomatic patients, what we would say is that's a life type activity, back to work, back to school. We see the interest level dramatically increasing with many different use cases. And we expect to play a role in a number of that. And some of that is embedded in the demand that is in Q3. And my take is that the methodology on asymptomatic screening, not the platform, but things like pooling and so forth could facilitate some of that ramp up over time as a different strategy. So, I think that will create a tailwind over time to support the activity while testing its relevant. On serology, we're developing our assay. We're taking it through the regulatory process. As the medical community better understands the immune response or what it means, serological testing becomes more relevant. And so right now, there's capacity out there. We're bringing out a high quality tests. And as customers need it, we'll be able to supply. You do have one question for Stephen quickly. We should wrap.\nSteve Beuchaw: One question just real quick for Stephen. Can you put any commentary around cost savings that you've identified from things like, lower T&E or other expenses from being virtual that you think are sustainable? Thanks so much.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So clearly, we control costs very effectively and we're all learning to live in a different environment. And T&E expenses are going to be dramatically lower, I think for the long-term, since that\u2019s how we are thinking about managing the Company and taking advantage of the technologies that we've invested in over time. So, it\u2019s my guess is probably a couple of hundred million dollars over time that you get to that level of saving of ongoing costs. So, we're appropriately managing the Company both, short-term and I think the long-term opportunities.\nMarc Casper: So, we'll wrap here with -- first, thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to have delivered an exceptional quarter during a very challenging time. We're proud of our role in helping our customers and society. And we're going to continue to manage the Company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress, and I hope that you stay safe. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by framing our Q2 organic growth performance. As Marc mentioned, we had an outstanding quarter and we grew organically 11%. I think, it is best to break the growth into two elements. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds that we generated during the quarter; and the second is the performance of the rest of our business, including share gain and market growth, as well as the headwinds from COVID-19 caused by disruptions to customer activity. We estimate that the tailwinds from COVID-19 were approximately $1.3 billion or 21% of growth in the quarter, largely driven by testing-related kits and instruments. The tailwinds were significantly stronger than we originally expected, driven by the increased scale and duration of the pandemic, and the speed at which we were able to ramp up our response and extend our relevant offerings to our customers. The rest of the business, excluding the COVID-19 tailwinds performed just about the high end of our initial range of expectations for the quarter. The team executed really well to serve all of our customers throughout Q2. The result is that we delivered outstanding top-line growth in the quarter. We are able to manage the Company very effectively during a period of significant economic disruption and translate that top line growth into excellent bottom line growth. We appropriately managed the businesses with the strongest headwinds while maximizing the tailwind opportunities and continuing to invest for really bright future. All of this enabled us to deliver 26% growth in adjusted operating income and 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share, an excellent quarter overall. I'll now give you some more details of the second quarter results for the total Company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q2 earnings results. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS 28% to $3.89; GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.90, up 5% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 11% organic growth and the foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1%. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter. North America grew 10%, Europe grew in the high teens, Asia Pacific was flat with China down approximately 15%, and the Rest of the World grew 50%. Looking at our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 27%, 350 basis points higher than Q2 last year. We saw very strong volume contributions, positive business mix and continued productivity investments -- improvements driven by our PPI business system, including appropriate cost controls, given the headwinds from COVID-19. During the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in the businesses. This was the last quarter of impact from our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business, which we sold at the end of Q2 2019. The divestiture was approximately $0.02 diluted in the quarter and was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $50 million on revenue, $12 million on just the adjusted operating income and a negligible impact on adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, up 390 basis points from Q2 of the prior year. Gross margin expansion was driven by the same factors as our adjusted operating margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.9% of revenue, an increase of 50 basis points versus Q2 2019. Total R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 5.6%. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $129 million, $8 million higher than Q2 last year. Adjusted other income and expense was net income in the quarter of $16 million, similar to Q2 2019. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.5%, up 50 basis points versus Q2 last year. And average diluted shares were 398 million in Q2, 5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations was very strong in the first half of the year, totaling $2.2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $500 million. We returned approximately $85 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 16% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and $21.3 billion of total debt as we prepare for the financing of the Qiagen acquisition. During the quarter, we raised \u20ac1.2 billion through the issuance of euro-denominated senior notes. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. And wrapping up my comments on our total Company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 12.5%, up 110 basis points from Q2 last year, as we continue to generate very strong returns. So, now, I'll prove some color on the performance of our four business segments. I thought it'd be helpful to start with a couple of framing comments around the impact of segment results. The complexity here shows the breadth of our response to meet the needs of our customers at this critical time. From a revenue standpoint in Q2, approximately three quarters of the COVID-19 tailwinds are reflected in Life Sciences Solutions. That includes testing related kits, instruments and sample preparations. This is recognized in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses.  The Specialty Diagnostics segments include the revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized sales of viral transport media and the microbiology business, as well as sales of tests and PPEs by the healthcare market channel. The Laboratory Products and Services segment also includes revenue from sales of PPE recorded in the research and taking market channels. In addition, this segment includes testing workflow-related plastics made by our lab products business, and vaccine and therapy development and production support from our pharma services business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments. The impact depended on the mix of revenue tailwinds and headwinds, as well as the different levels of pull through on that revenue mix. Across the Company, we used our PPI business system to manage cost appropriately given the uncertain environment, and that had a positive impact in each segment. At the same time, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in our businesses, even in those where COVID-19 was a net headwind. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition, as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. We were able to do this given the strength of the Company's overall performance. Those investments do not necessarily match with the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds and headwinds in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported margins in the segments. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment standpoint but all reflective of very active management of the Company, allowing us to navigate successfully through unprecedented times and positioning us really well for the future. So, moving on to the segment detail, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 52% and organic revenue growth was 55%, driven by exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business as well as continued strong growth in bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 103% and adjusted operating margin was 47.4%, up 12 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity as positive business mix and continued to make significant strategic investments across the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 21% in Q2 and organic revenue decline of 20%. COVID-19 disruption to our customers continues to have a significant impact to the business in this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 53% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, down 870 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity driven by our PPI activities, which was more than offset by volume headwinds, business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments. As a reminder, this is the segment that previously included the anatomical pathology business, which we sold in June last year. In Q2, reported revenue increased by 5%, organic revenue growth was 12%. Some of the businesses in this segment were significantly impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds in the quarter. This was as a result of decrease in doctor visits and related testing. Most impacted were the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. That said, this segment also saw a significant COVID-19-related tailwinds in the quarter. We saw very strong growth in our healthcare market channel and our clinical diagnostics and microbiology businesses. Adjusted operating income decreased 12%, which included a 5% headwind from the divestiture. Adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, down 410 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw a strong volume leverage in productivity. However, this was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q2 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 5%. In the quarter, growth within the segment was led by our pharma services. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q2 decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 10.1%, which was lower than the prior year by 300 basis points. In the quarter, we saw a strong productivity and volume leverage. So, this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic and related customer impact continues to evolve. And as a result, we're still not in a position to provide full year detailed guidance. However, as we did last quarter, I will provide you with some color on how we're viewing organic growth for the coming quarter as well as certain full year 2020 assumptions to help you in your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. There are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3. I will outline of the factors to consider when thinking about our potential growth for the coming quarter. As was the case last quarter, there are two key variables that would drive our growth in Q3. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds; the second is the headwind caused by COVID-19-related disruption to our customers' activity. Regarding the revenue tailwinds, clearly there is a wide range of outcomes here. But, our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 is approximately $1.1 billion of revenue, which would translate to just under 18% of growth. The volume of COVID-19 testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor, determining the expense of our revenue tailwinds in Q3. Regarding the rest of our revenue growth, which is a combination of the COVID-19-related headwinds, underlying market growth, and our share gain activity, we estimate this will be in the range of approximately flat to negative 5% in Q3. This compares to negative 10% in Q2. The improvement quarter-over-quarter is driven by an assumed gradual ramp in customer activity. As they return more fully to the workplace. It's important to note that the range does not anticipate to return to the lockdowns seen at the height of the pandemic. So, when you put all this together, as I mentioned our current best estimate of Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. Given the fluidity of the situation, there are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3 with testing demand being the most significant swing factor. I will now move on to an update of some of the modeling elements for the full year. With regards to FX, in 2020, we're now assuming that this is a year-over-year headwind on revenue of $200 million or just under 1%. There's $0.06 of dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, which reflects revenue and operating income headwinds of $105 million and $30 million, respectively. We're continuing to assume that the acquisitions we completed in 2019 will contribute approximately $160 million to our reported revenue growth in 2020. As a reminder, on the calendar, it was one less day in Q1 and there will be two extra days in Q4 this year. We continue to expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $460 million. This includes the Qiagen acquisition pre-funding completed to-date. In 2020, that equates to a cost of $90 million or $0.17 to adjusted earnings per share. We will continue to look at opportunities to prefund more of the transaction during the remainder of 2020. We continue to assume that adjusted other net income will be about $70 million for the year. And with regards to net capital expenditures, we now expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. This includes approximately $300 million of capital expenditure to support our COVID-19 response. In terms of capital deployment, we completed $1.5 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and are assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We estimate that full year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. And we continue to assume that we'll return approximately $350 million for capital to shareholders this year through dividends. So to wrap up, as you can see from our outstanding performance in Q2, we continue to manage the Company extremely effectively in a very dynamic environment. With that I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Yes. So, Vijay, I'll take that one. So, when you think about Q2, 11% organic growth drove 28% growth in adjusted EPS. So, it's a very strong performance. So you think about Q3, and most likely outcome based on what we're thinking right now is 15% organic growth and that would drive very strong adjusted EPS as well. I think about Q3 to Q2, kind of the change in the mix of the business in the 15% versus the 11%. It's likely to be slightly less favorable business mix within that revenue. Obviously, this is scenario where that mix could play out to better, but I think that's a good place, a good way to think about modeling for Q3. Yes. That was very skewed by the tailwinds. When you think about tailwinds at large, they're going to be consumables right now. Excluding that, I clearly instrument purchases were at a lower level of growth than consumables and services. Customer activity has been relatively low. And we expect that to pick up in the second half of the year. Yes. And we've also increased that CapEx significantly to address capacity and capability enhancements for the COVID-19 response as well. Yes. So clearly, we control costs very effectively and we're all learning to live in a different environment. And T&E expenses are going to be dramatically lower, I think for the long-term, since that's how we are thinking about managing the Company and taking advantage of the technologies that we've invested in over time. So, it's my guess is probably a couple of hundred million dollars over time that you get to that level of saving of ongoing costs. So, we're appropriately managing the Company both, short-term and I think the long-term opportunities."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 second quarter call. What an incredible quarter we just had. When we gave our update during our Q1 call, we provided our best thinking on our Q2 expectations in an environment no one had ever seen before. We were prepared for the most difficult quarter we've seen in the 18 years I've been with Thermo Fisher, and we successfully navigated the environment to deliver truly extraordinary performance. Our teams did a remarkable job of helping our customers respond to the pandemic. Their tireless effort and determination drove very strong results, generating material COVID-19 tailwinds, while minimizing the impact of customer disruption created by lockdowns around the world. Our performance in Q2 put a spotlight on the talent of our team, the advantage of our industry-leading scale and depth of capabilities, and the importance of our role in supporting our customers and society. We continuously built on our strengths. And what we've accomplished in the past few months shows that Thermo Fisher can perform extremely well, even in the most difficult circumstances. I know I'll always think back on this period as among our most -- our finest moments as a team and as a company. I look forward to covering some of the many highlights of the quarter with you this morning. So, I'll start with our financial results, which exceeded our expectations across the board. As you saw in our press release, our reported revenue increased 10% in Q2 year-over-year to $6.92 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 26% to $1.86 billion. And our adjusted operating margin increased to 27% in Q2, which was 350 basis points of expansion. Finally, we grew adjusted EPS by 28% to $3.89 per share in the quarter. We delivered such outstanding financial performance in Q2 because we worked with speed at scale, and quickly mobilized our resources to help our customers respond to the pandemic across the globe. Our solutions met their needs, generating approximately $1.3 billion of COVID revenue tailwinds. Our teams also did an excellent job of mitigating the headwinds in other parts of our Company. And we managed the Company aggressively and appropriately in a very fluid environment to set ourselves up for an even brighter future. Turning to our performance by end markets. Let me start with an overall comment for context. As you know, the pandemic has generated both, significant headwinds and tailwinds in our industry. And this impacted each of our end markets to varying degrees. On one hand, we saw greatly reduced customer activity due to work disruptions; and on the other, we benefited significantly from our COVID-19 response. We managed the Company very effectively through this dynamic to deliver an exceptional quarter. So, starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets. It was another great quarter and we continued to perform very well here in Q2, growing just under 10%. We had particularly strong performance in our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Turning to industrial and applied. We saw a decline of just over 10% in Q2, while in academic and government we declined approximately 20%. Customers in these two end markets were significantly affected by business disruptions during the quarter due to the pandemic. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare. While we saw significant headwinds in this market due to a decrease in doctor visits and related testing, we met the incredible demand for COVID-19 testing and were able to deliver growth of just over 70% in Q2. We're providing customers with our proprietary diagnostic test kits, instrumentation and viral transport media, as well as reagents used for laboratory developed tests. And I'll talk more about our involvement later in my remarks. To wrap up our end market commentary, our teams put forth an amazing effort supporting our customers and meeting the societal response of the pandemic, while effectively managing the Company to deliver outstanding growth in Q2. Turning to the business highlights for the quarter. On our Q1 call, I departed from my typical agenda bit and talked about the three guiding principles we're following to manage through these unprecedented times. To remind you, the first is ensuring the safety of our colleagues; our second guiding principle is to maintain business continuity, so we can continue to support our customers, whether they're directly responding to the pandemic or continuing their work more broadly; and third, we manage our Company appropriately, so we come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. As I reflect on Q2, those guiding principles have served us very well. We've successfully implemented numerous safety protocols at our sites that has kept our business running so we can continue to serve our customers at a time when they need us most. Let me focus today on the last guiding principle, managing the Company appropriately. And to reiterate, it's a combination of relentless focus on executing a long-term growth strategy while ensuring that we successfully navigate the short-term challenges and generate new opportunities as well. During this time, we've been carefully managing costs while confidently investing to position the business for long-term share gain and accelerated growth. This includes continuing to invest in key R&D programs, even in parts of the business where demand is temporarily impacted. For example, we had a great showing at the virtual American Society of Mass Spectrometry conference in June, where we launched two new Orbitrap Exploris instruments to advance biotherapeutic research. These types of investments across our businesses will position us well to capture the opportunities as customer activity returns to more normal levels. The second quarter reinforced why we're recognized as a world leader in serving science. I've been overwhelmed by the outreach we've had from the most senior government officials around the globe, to the leaders of healthcare institutions, to the top executives of the world's largest companies. They're all navigating challenges never experienced before, whether they're protecting the safety of their own workforce or communities managing the incredible volume of testing with trying to understand the virus, to identify therapies and accelerate the development of vaccines. We are in the best position to help them meet these challenges because we remain focused on executing our growth strategy by continuously innovating, leveraging our scale and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. We're involved in virtually every aspect of the pandemic response from providing research tools, to personal protective equipment, to diagnostics, as well as supporting the development and production of therapies and vaccines. Our mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer, and it highlights the critical role we play. This morning, I'm going to focus on the two most prominent aspects of our involvement, diagnostic testing, and the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics. First, testing. It was an exceptional quarter for us, given the role we play in COVID-19 diagnostics. We created a major business line in a few months and have continued to expand our capabilities. I'll cover just some of the highlights. As you know, our industry-leading PCR franchise has always played a role in our customers' ability to provide lab developed tests. And our reagents and consumables support many COVID-19 tests in use around the world. But our role significantly expanded when we received regulatory approvals back in March for our TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Our PCR-based workflow is widely used in 50 countries. And these tests are considered the gold standard, given their high level of accuracy. April was all about ramping up manufacturing and helping getting our customers to get their labs ready to handle the significant volume of testing. Our teams rapidly scaled production at an incredible pace, and we ended the quarter with enough capacity to produce more than 10 million tests per week, should our customers need that level of testing. Our field services team and application specialists did a remarkable job of getting our customers ramped up to COVID-19 testing. In May, we received an expanded emergency use authorization or EUA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allowed more of our PCR instruments to run these tests to help address the huge demand. The EUA also provided more options for reagents and consumables, which provides customers with greater flexibility in testing workflow. The overwhelming demand for testing created significant strain on the industry's supply of sample collection materials. The swabs, vials and media needed to effectively collect and transport the specimen to a testing lab for processing. The U.S. government came to us for help. And given our understanding of the challenge, we worked with them to significantly ramp up production of highly specialized viral transport media or VTM, to address this need. VTM is critical to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 test results, and must be manufactured and dispensed into vials in an aseptic environment. We designed and built a new factory in Lenexa, Kansas in about six weeks, and we produced our first VTM vials at this new facility on the July 4, the exact date we set out in our ambitious project plan. This was a very exciting accomplishment for our teams. Whether it was in Lenexa or all of the other ramp-up projects related to COVID, our industry-leading scale and the power of our PPI business system were key enablers in achieving these milestones in such a short period of time, while managing enormous complexity and meeting all the regulatory requirements. Looking forward, in addition to our PCR-based TaqPath kit, which determines if a patient has an active infection, we plan on launching additional tests. We're developing a serological test that can tell if a patient has ever been exposed to the virus. And in addition, we're developing a respiratory panel to help doctors determine whether a person has COVID-19 or different respiratory disease. And our goal is to launch this panel as of the flu season. We're working through the regulatory processes to make both of these tests available to customers globally. The other significant aspect of our involvement is the work we're doing to support our pharma and biotech customers in the ways to launch COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. As you know, we're a leader in the development and production of vaccines, antivirals and other therapies through our pharma services business. And we're currently working on more than 200 COVID-related projects globally. We're leveraging our global network to support governments and customers as they accelerate these projects, including some that are undergoing human clinical trials, by providing critical capacity and expertise to get new products to market and ultimately to patients. To give you one example, we're playing a key role in the U.S. government's pandemic countermeasure program, managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA. We received funding to support the expansion of our manufacturing capacity for sterile injectables, which can be used to fill a high volume of vaccine doses. In addition, we're expanding capacity for customers who are developing COVID-19 therapies, including promising antivirals to compress timelines to meet the expected surge in demand. While we continue to increase our support of the pandemic response, we're also expanding our pharma services capacity globally to ensure that we can deliver critical medicines for treating a range of serious health conditions. I'll highlight two examples from the quarter. One is the new site we're building in Plainville, Massachusetts, which will essentially double our viral vector manufacturing capacity. This is another in our series of expansions in the U.S. that will help us meet demand for the development and production of gene therapies. The other development is our strategic partnership with CSL, the global biotech company to help to meet high demand for biologics. We will support CSL's product portfolio by leveraging our entire network, including drug development, production, packaging and clinical trials. And under a long-term agreement, we will also take over CSL's state-of-the-art biologics facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, which is currently under construction and expected to be completed in the 2021. This site will feature both, high-volume stainless steel and highly flexible single-use bioproduction technologies, and our plan is just to expand its use to support a number of customers. All of these strategic investments will ensure that we can deliver on our value proposition for pharma and biotech customers through a powerful combination of expertise, flexibility and scale. Turning now to capital deployment, I'll make a couple of comments on pending acquisition of Qiagen. As you saw in our press release last Thursday, we announced that we renegotiated certain aspects of our acquisition agreement. Given the considerable changes in industry dynamics since we originally announced the transaction in early March, we revised our offer. Qiagen is making a significant contribution to the global pandemic response, and we believe our new all-cash offer of \u20ac43 per share, reflects the full and fair value of the business in the current environment, while generating strong returns for both sets of shareholders. We're very excited about this transaction. We look forward to bringing together our complementary offerings to help our customers fight the ongoing pandemic and combat other infectious diseases and emerging health needs. For our shareholders, we expect strong returns and believe that the accretion will be slightly more favorable than what we articulated in early March. While there is still much of work to be done over the next several months, we're on track with the regulatory process and expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021. Qiagen is an excellent fit for our Company, and we're excited about the new opportunities we'll have following the close. Now, I'll make a quick comment on guidance. As you know, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance in early April due to the uncertainty around the pandemic and its potential impact on our customers. Now, here we are in late July, and it's obviously still a very uncertain time. Similar to Q1, while we're not ready to reinstate annual guidance, we want to provide you with as much color as possible on our expectations for the current quarter. Stephen will review the specifics in his remarks, including our organic growth expectations and key assumptions for Q3. Before I turn the call to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We're playing a significant role in helping our customers to respond to the pandemic and making a huge impact on society. Our teams are managing the business very well through this unprecedented time to mitigate the headwinds and create new opportunities. We're continuing to execute our growth strategy to position Thermo Fisher for an even brighter future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes. Tycho, thanks for the question. As I look to the COVID -- impact of COVID going forward, the largest determinant this year and the impact is going to be related to the testing demand. And certainly, as you get into 2021, you're going to see a larger and larger impact of the activities we do in our pharma services business to support the therapy and vaccine development and ramp up, or we get some of that now. When I look at the going forward for COVID-19 testing, we obviously have a leading position in PCR platform. Around the world, our response has been a very significant ramp-up in capacity. And we anticipate that the demand certainly in Q3 will continue to be at a very strong level. And, most of us are obviously very dominated by U.S. headlines, but what you see is generally demand picking up further in the U.S. but you also see demand weakening in other geographies. Europe, we have lower demand as you saw in Q2. That may change. But the net of it is fairly similar revenues to what we saw in Q2 is what we're expecting for Q3. Yes. So, in terms of the pharma services activity, we're very involved with a very large number of programs. And when I look at sort of the headwinds from the pandemic on clinical trials, outside of the COVID, there was some, but not meaningful. And when I look to China at a high level, we saw demand build throughout the quarter, in terms of where we were. And the way that I would think about is, China was very, very conservative on the opening up of academic institutions. So, that actually was a little bit more muted than what we would have expected back in April. But it's picking up in Q3. It looks to be more encouraging. Thank you, Tycho. When I think about the vaccine opportunity, what's a little bit hard to quantify is what's the vaccine strategy going to be used around the world? So, I'm talking more what's the total amount of vaccine going to be produced? Are we thinking about the world getting high-risk population, are we thinking about the just the countries that can afford a vaccine, or we thinking about 7 billion people ultimately getting a vaccine? And that leads to a massively wide range of what the outcomes are. What I would expect, should there be a successful vaccine, is that, the role of a company like Thermo Fisher and certainly the CDMO industry more generally will play a significant role, based on the fact that the ramp-up under every scenario would be very dramatic. We've been very-active in those projects and many of the high-profile projects that you read about. We are either providing raw materials from our bioproduction or biosciences business to having roles in the production ultimately of what I'll call drug substance or vaccine substance in certain cases, and certainly a very meaningful role in the sterile fill-finish with a final packaging form that a vaccine would be administered. So, we expect if a vaccine is successful that it will be a meaningful tailwind over time with revenue that we've already gotten a little bit of and ramp slowly through the balance of this year and would be more meaningful in 2021-2022 should the vaccine be successful. So, we chose not to give the full year guidance because when you think about the potential mix and range of growth in each segment, to give a raise that would be useful, the number would be enormously wide. So, what we are looking at is, as we get more predictability into what the world looks like, especially in Q4 where you don't know what the virus looks like, you could have a very bullish scenario. You could actually have a pessimistic scenario, if there was a dramatic -- this current wave gets much worse, you could be more pessimistic. So, we're keeping our thinking on what the right external approach is. We feel good about our outline for Q3. And I think you've got a sense from our Q2 performance, we're going to deliver an outstanding year financially and it'll be managing through whatever environment is thrown at us, we're going to create great opportunities to drive share gains, top-line growth and extraordinary earnings performance. So, Derik, thanks for the question. Let me tell you how we're planning. That's probably -- it's impossible to predict in a certain way. It feels like a month as far as these days. But, what we're expecting from everything we know is that we're going to be living with the pandemic for a number of quarters. It'll take time for a vaccine to be in the market if it's successful. Well, therapies are making progress again that these will take time and that the virus continues to spread in many countries around the world. So, that this is not a, it's done quickly scenario. And therefore, we're expecting that 2021, we'll be navigating through both, headwinds of disruptions of some sort related to the pandemic, but also the continued societal response needed to that. And we think we're incredibly well-positioned, based on our quality, scalability of manufacturing and very large installed base and very exquisite customer relationships. We feel good about that will play a meaningful role in 2021 for the testing volumes that are needed by customers. And what that number is going to be, is a very, very enormous range of outcomes. But our manufacturing teams have been remarkable and the power of our PPI business system has been astonishing. And if you think back, when I was at the White House at the end of April, I said that we're working our way to be able to produce 10 million kits a week. And that was late April. And by the end of the quarter, our manufacturing capacity is about that. And that doesn't mean we're selling them any because demand will ebb and flow, but our ability to scale and meet whatever response is out there, we feel highly confident in that. Yes. So, in terms of academic and government end market, you obviously saw disruptions around the world at the beginning of the pandemic with activity very quickly ramping down. As you look at Western Europe, which actually started to strengthen steadily throughout the quarter. The U.S. which faced the pandemic slightly later than Europe is a little behind, but on the same type of trajectory with activity picking up. The interesting country has really been China, was -- actually kept most of its universities closed for most of the quarter. That activity is picking up as well, but actually a little bit more slowly than one would anticipate -- one would have anticipated. So the impact of that is obviously, they weren't customers able to receive instruments as easily as normal. And so, we would expect that as academic and government customers reopen in that setting, you'll see instruments demand start to pick up as well. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So Jack, when the team's view, right, when we were sitting in February and looking at the situation in China, the team's view was having a very clear set of guiding principles, right, which was the obvious. Keep your colleagues safe, support your customers activity, and the third is manage the Company appropriately in this environment. And we came with a very clear view of what that meant, which is, of course, manage costs tightly because there's going to be disruption to demand, but be very aggressive to position the Company for a brighter future to solidify and strengthen and hopefully even increase the growth outlook of the Company for the longer term. Normal for us is 5% to 7% growth, and we've been taking actions to create an even brighter future. So, we need to get higher in that range when you're in a normal environment or above that range. And we have no idea now. But I know we're taking the actions to strengthen the long-term outlook of the Company. And because we've been able to respond so aggressively to help our customers navigate the pandemic, we're obviously in the midst of an incredibly strong year as well. So, we're -- at this point, obviously we had about 7% organic growth when you look at the first half, so at the high end of our normal range. And obviously with the Q3, this could be a very significant year as well in terms of performance. Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. As everybody here knows, we're extraordinarily disciplined in terms of our capital deployment strategy and ensuring that where we deploy our capital, we're going to strengthen the Company strategically and generate strong returns for our shareholders. The dynamics are obviously, as you said, very different, from the beginning of March to now. And Qiagen has done a good job in terms of stepping up and making a real impact on society from a pandemic response. And we thought our way through that and had very good negotiations with Qiagen and came to an agreement at the \u20ac43. And we believe that's the full and fair value. In terms of our view is, we were very clear in the process, and we disclosed that this morning, I think early hours because of the German regulations. That is our best and final offer. And the process is very straightforward. The tender I believe ends around August 10th. And if we clear the 66.67% threshold, then the tender is complete, so mechanism and the deal proceeds. And if we don't get to 66.67%, the deal is over, because there's a cooling off period in Germany. So, there is no revised offer. That is what it is. And, we think it's very appropriate for both sets of shareholders. And we look forward to completing the tender process and then moving forward through the regulatory process and welcoming over 5,000 new colleagues next year into the Company. It's not a way that we manage the business quite, Doug. Let me try to get you an answer more about activity levels in the non-COVID, and make some qualitative views around it. So, for Q2 Doug, the non-COVID related businesses declined 10%, right, which was just above what the better end of our expectations that we gave in the guidance process, right? So, that's where it ended. June was down about 5%. So, you saw, April, May were worse. June was about negative five. The range of outcomes that Stephen articulated in the outlook for Q3 was a range of negative 5 to flat. The negative 5 would assume that what we saw in June continues throughout the quarter. The flat basically is a steady improvement throughout the quarter. And when you think about that in normal quarter for us is 5% to 7% growth on that business, right? So, even at flat, you're still 5 to 7 points below what we would have experienced for the last five, seven years, right? So, it's a steady increase in activity is what is assumed. And when you look at that on the non-COVID-related businesses, pharma biotech has continued to be the least impacted and would likely be the least impacted, and academic and government, industrial and applied, and the healthcare, diagnostics, they all should start to see some level of step up throughout the quarter is the way I would think about it. It's really extraordinarily different to do. Let me just visualize it for you, which is why I really can't give you an answer. If you think about the vaccine, I can give you two different views of how it gets administered in those cases. One is single unit, meaning one vial, one vaccine; another is a vial where you put a syringe and take out the vaccine and you have 10 or 20 units of the vaccine doses in the single thing. You're going to get wildly different CDMO revenue or our revenue based on just even the filling strategy of those companies. So, very hard to do a rule of thumb until you know exactly the dosage form and so forth. And, is it -- what's the technology used in the vaccine. So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, from a capital deployment strategy, I don't think it really changes too much. What I would say is, over the longer period of time, it's going to be a blend return of capital and the majority being redeployed into M&A in the business. If you think about the past quarter or March forward, obviously a large acquisition in Qiagen, also a nice bolt-on acquisition, which we announced and will close next year in CSL's biologics facility. And I think, you'll see us do a cadence of smaller and larger deals over time with a steady return of capital. So, our business is performing at a high level. Our expectations for the future is that it's going to perform at a high level. And that's going to give us very substantial cash flow to be able to redeploy. So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, as we talk to governments and we talk to our customers and we use our experience, life science tools and diagnostics and our pharma service capabilities, it's a fantastic industry with great market growth characteristics you see in the industry perform well in this environment. My expectation is when the dust settles, the commitment to life science research, healthcare infrastructure systems is going to be even better over time than what the strong period that we enjoyed. And we're seeing some of the early excitement of the importance of the work. And so, I'm very bullish about what the long-term benefit will be. Obviously, there's going to be ebbs and flows because of the economy and affordability and those things. But, if I think the long term perspective, I'm very optimistic for what our industry holds and for the strong competitive position that we've built to serve in that industry. Yes. So, Steve, thanks for the question. In terms of screening or asymptomatic patients, what we would say is that's a life type activity, back to work, back to school. We see the interest level dramatically increasing with many different use cases. And we expect to play a role in a number of that. And some of that is embedded in the demand that is in Q3. And my take is that the methodology on asymptomatic screening, not the platform, but things like pooling and so forth could facilitate some of that ramp up over time as a different strategy. So, I think that will create a tailwind over time to support the activity while testing its relevant. On serology, we're developing our assay. We're taking it through the regulatory process. As the medical community better understands the immune response or what it means, serological testing becomes more relevant. And so right now, there's capacity out there. We're bringing out a high quality tests. And as customers need it, we'll be able to supply. You do have one question for Stephen quickly. We should wrap. So, we'll wrap here with -- first, thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to have delivered an exceptional quarter during a very challenging time. We're proud of our role in helping our customers and society. And we're going to continue to manage the Company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress, and I hope that you stay safe. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PPD's First Quarter two020 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nate Speicher, Senior Vice President of Finance for PPD. Mr. Speicher, you may begin.\nNate Speicher: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the earnings call. Today, we'll review our financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2020. Joining me on the call today are David Simmons, PPD's Chairman and CEO; Bill Sharbaugh, our COO; and Chris Scully, our CFO. Please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the current business environment and as such, includes certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. More information about potential risk factors can be found in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our upcoming Form 10-Q filing. Also, in addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, we will be discussing financial measures that do not conform to GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures enhance the understanding of our performance because they are more representative of how we internally measure our business. Please note these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is available in the press release we issued last night and supplemental investor presentation posted to our Investor Relations website. Lastly, regarding the basis of presentation for today's discussion, please note that all P&L metrics discussed, including revenue, segment revenue and adjusted EBITDA on an ASC 606 basis. For commercial metrics discussed, including net authorizations, net book-to-bill, backlog and backlog conversion, those remain on a historical as-awarded ASC 605 direct-only basis unless otherwise noted. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Simmons: Thank you, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 2020 earnings call. I'd like to start by saying I hope you, your families and your colleagues are safe amidst the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our collective focus on COVID 19, in addition to reviewing our Q1 results, we plan to spend a sizable amount of our time this morning discussing the impact to our business stemming from the virus as well as our ability to minimize the negative impacts and to continue playing a critical role, aiding solution development in the form of treatments and vaccines. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we've withdrawn our previously issued guidance for the full year 2020 and today, are issuing new guidance for the second quarter, which Chris will cover in his remarks. Regarding the first quarter results, during the quarter, we saw strong growth across both key commercial and P&L metrics. A few highlights include: net authorizations of $1.06 billion resulting in a Q1 net book-to-bill of 1.3x and notably, we did not see any unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19; a record ending backlog of $7.3 billion, an increase of 11.9% year-on-year; double-digit P&L growth with revenue of $1.07 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million, representing 11.3% and 17.3% growth versus the prior year, respectively, with strong underlying contributions from both our clinical and laboratory segments, which had top line growth of 8% and 31%, respectively; ending cash of $738 million, our highest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years; continued progress on our balance sheet objectives, with net leverage declining from 6.9x as of Q4 to 4.7x, immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of the end of Q1. While we're pleased with our first quarter results, we continue to be focused on the here and now and managing through this pandemic. Fundamentally, clinical trials exist to address unmet patient needs, and these needs have not gone away as a result of the pandemic. In fact, PPD's purpose and mission have never been more clear and inspiring to our organization than they are at this time. The pandemic has presented headwinds to our business, yet we feel confident that the mitigating actions we've taken and the tailwinds we are experiencing from COVID-19-related work will allow us to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position. During our Q4 earnings call, I shared PPD's three priorities related to COVID-19 and I'd like to provide an update across these priorities. First, our main priority is employee and patient safety. We quickly organized a Pandemic Committee, co-chaired by our Chief Medical Officer and Chief HR Officer to protect colleague and patient safety. Through this team's leadership, we quickly moved to remote work for all remote-capable employees, closed domiciling at our Phase I clinics and instituted measures across our offices, sites and labs to maximize employee safety. Our second priority has been business continuity with the dual goals of delivering for our customers and maintaining financial strength. Across both of these goals, we entered the pandemic from a position of strength. Our long-standing reputation of delivery excellence coupled with our investments in owned-site networks, digital and virtual trial solutions and remote site monitoring tools have enabled us to provide trial continuity solutions for our customers. Our teams are working hand-in-hand with our customers to ensure continuity of their studies. And our customers are looking for our guidance and partnership related to digital and virtual solutions across their pipelines. Bill will provide further details on this front, but the power of our enterprise to fulfill customers' needs has never been more clear. Although more than half of active investigator sites have been impacted, we have adapted and shifted our resources to continue to make progress on our customer studies, such as focusing our team on the trial work not related to site visits and shifting available resources to support new COVID-19 clinical trials. The adaptability of our organization across all levels, our low turnover and the cross-training of our team members continues to embed confidence in our customers that PPD is their partner of choice through this pandemic. Regarding financial strength, it has been important to PPD to maintain our balance sheet while minimizing the impact to our talented colleagues. We have taken a balanced approach to cost mitigation and implemented a program we call Choice, where employees are permitted to take a short-term sabbatical or temporary hours reduction. With more than 600 employees taking us up on this entirely voluntary program, it is clear that this was a needed offering for employees to balance work and family needs while delivering cost savings to the company. Most importantly, this program positions us well to quickly mobilize resources as sites resume clinical trial activity. This last point is critical because we believe when we do get back to something close to normalcy, we will have to execute on our full plan of work plus catch-up work that has been building up. In addition to the Choice program, we have implemented a suite of more typical cost control actions, including fast and severe restrictions on travel, a salary freeze for executive management and paused hiring in areas where demand is delayed while still adding targeted resources for areas of work expansion such as COVID-19-related work. Speaking of COVID-19 work, we are proud to be an active part of the solution to this pandemic. The strength of our infectious diseases and vaccines franchises with experience on 300 trials over the last five years, coupled with our regulatory expertise in this space, has allowed us to build a leadership position in COVID-19-related vaccines and treatments, with 39 awards to date, spanning our clinical and lab segments. We continue to be actively involved in bidding on several dozen additional clinical trials targeting COVID-19. In anticipation of the growing demand for our services, we are proactively building capacity across functions to partner with our customers as they tackle treatment and vaccine development for COVID-19. As you'll recall from the Q4 earnings call, I mentioned that we quickly mobilized a team who has proactively engaged all companies that have announced COVID-19 work in the public domain. I did not expect at that time the depth and breadth of studies that would launch. It has been incredible to see the power of the industry and how fast our customers have turned on a dime to address this global health crisis. And our team has reacted just as quickly. Current treatment studies that we're partnered on are projected to enroll upwards of 13,000 patients. Looking forward, we remain fundamentally bullish about the outlook for PPD in our industry. This pandemic represents a dramatic real-world example of the value the innovative life sciences industry provides to society. I expect this crisis to have a positive impact to R&D investment levels in the coming years as well as aiding accelerated adoption of innovative approaches to trial conduct. We are also experiencing even greater collaboration between pharma sponsors, CROs and regulators, which bodes well for the future of innovative new medicines. Lastly, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 examples I discussed, we believe our differentiated services, unique customer engagement model and continued commitment to operational excellence, will be increasingly important to customers and positions us well for continued strong growth post this pandemic. I'd like to close by saying how proud I am of our 24,000-plus colleagues around the world. Their willingness to go above and beyond for our customers and patients, while exercising caution to blunt the spread of the virus has been truly remarkable, and I'm thankful for their dedication and hard work. We'll continue to provide updates on this topic in the coming quarters as the situation evolves. I'll now turn it over to Bill Sharbaugh, our Chief Operating Officer, to review our operating results.\nBill Sharbaugh: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we saw continued operating momentum across the business with strong financial performance from both our segments. I would call out the exceptionally strong results within our Laboratory Services segment. Our labs produced organic revenue growth in excess of 30% versus prior year, resulting from strong authorizations, rapid customer uptake of new facility expansions in our GMP lab and increased FTE contracts in the vaccine lab. Given the focus on COVID-19, my comments will largely center on our business continuity efforts and how we are responding to the crisis. Our long-standing history of operational excellence, along with our unique mix of clinical and lab services, put us in a strong position heading into the pandemic. Before I go through the segments, I would note that while we are sharing certain operating metrics, as our peers have done, these are inherently difficult to compare across the space. I'll start with commentary on our Clinical Development Services business. Our clinical business is impacted in three ways. First, as David noted earlier, the majority of studies are continuing, and we haven't seen an increase in cancellations. But we have seen several sponsors implement enrollment pauses for studies that have not started or studies with at-risk patient populations, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. For those studies that have yet to start-up, some sponsors are requesting us to complete preenrollment tasks, such as country in-site selection, remote site initiation visits, study, design and planning and database building so that the new trial can start quickly once given the green light. Overall, we estimate that approximately 10% of our clinical services backlog is impacted by these pauses while 90% continues. Second, physical access to sites has been disrupted despite regulatory agencies around the world issuing guidance supporting the continuance of clinical trials while protecting patient safety. In our case, we've seen approximately 54% of site institutions impacted whether it be a suspension of CRA site visits or other site-related activities. About 70% of our clinical trial revenue is not related to site monitoring. Of the 30% tied to monitoring, we've been able to migrate more than half our work to a remote-based approach. We've also deployed several strategies to ensure patient participation can continue. Our logistics network allows us to ship supplies and medications directly to the patient where appropriate. In addition, we are using digital techniques to screen, monitor and enroll patients for some clinical trials. PPD is also looking beyond digital and virtual solutions and traditional sites to find other ways to help customers continue their clinical trials. As an example, within a matter of weeks, PPD designed and operationalized a program that allows the transfer of clinical trial patients from sites that have closed due to the pandemic to our network of 180 research sites, which have remained open and can rescue delayed clinical trials. In addition, several customers moved volume to our medical communications call center as smaller competitors were unable to maintain business continuity. Third, we have won a significant amount of fast burning COVID-19 work, which is helping to partially offset the impacts I've mentioned. Our teams are working tirelessly to launch and execute these studies. In several cases, working through the night to activate sites to allow dosing of critically ill patients the following day. New COVID-19 studies, coupled with the backlog of tasks from ongoing clinical trials, position us for a busy period as we enter recovery. While we have seen work resume with a quickening pace in countries like China, including site monitoring visits and new activations, we expect the recovery to be more gradual throughout the rest of the world. We are poised to accelerate trial delivery as soon as sites reopen. I believe the strength of our people managers and our industry-low turnover will enable us to continue high-quality execution throughout the pandemic and into recovery. Chris will discuss the financial impacts in his comments. Now turning to the Laboratory Services segment. Let me provide some context on how this business has been impacted. To minimize the pandemic impacts, the lab's leadership team mobilized quickly to establish clear safety protocols, implement split shifts, segregate departmental teams and move remote-capable employees home. These strategies, in addition to close coordination with state and local authorities, ensured our scientific staff have access to facilities to progress work in a safe and efficient manner. As a reminder, PPD Labs is comprised of a broad range of capabilities focused on drug development and organized into bioanalytical, GMP, vaccine and central labs. In order of magnitude, our GMP, BioA and vaccine lab together represents about 2/3 of our Laboratory business. Our GMP, BioA and vaccine labs are not reliant on sample volumes. Rather, the key drivers for these labs are staff availability and facility capacity. With respect to the central lab, we have seen disruption to sample volumes, but as sites reopen, we are seeing volumes recover. Lastly, PPD is one of the leading experts in infectious disease and vaccines, and this is underpinned by our 30-plus years of experience, which includes 15 FDA-approved vaccines and experience in over 300 infectious disease and vaccine trials. As a result, our labs are actively involved in a significant amount of COVID-19 work, which we expect to increase going forward. While the pandemic has no doubt presented challenges, our operations remain strong, our leaders and employees are adapting and we have and will find ways to ensure colleague and patient safety. I'll now turn it over to Chris Scully, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results.\nChris Scully: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments on today's call, I'll be covering our quarter one results; updating you on our cash, liquidity position and capital structure, given increased investor focus on balance sheets amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; and lastly, providing you with an update on our forward guidance before opening up for Q&A. Before diving in, as Nate mentioned, throughout my comments when referring to our P&L, I'll be doing so on an ASC 606 basis. To that end, as you likely saw in our earnings release and investor supplement, we've now migrated our segment disclosures to be in an ASC 606 basis, based on how we now manage the business and to reduce the administrative burden of having to maintain and reconcile two sets of books. When referring to other metrics such as net authorizations, backlog, net book-to-bill ratios and DSOS, these will currently remain on a historical ASC 605 basis to maintain comparability for investors. However, we have additionally included in our investor press release and our investor supplement these metrics on an ASC 606 basis, both with and without indirects. In addition, given the exceptional circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we have expanded the operational and financial metrics that we are providing on this call, along with sharing quarterly guidance for quarter two. That said, I'd like to note that we are unlikely to provide similar levels of disclosure on an ongoing basis post the pandemic. Turning to quarter one. As David noted, the first quarter was strong for us in terms of awards, in which we booked $1.06 billion in net authorizations, resulting in a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.30x and a record ending-backlog of $7.31 billion, which is up 11.9% from quarter one, 2019. Putting this in context, the 1.30x net book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was our highest book-to-bill ratio in eight quarters, significantly above the 1.20x that has historically translated into double-digit revenue growth based on our backlog conversion rates. As David and Bill both noted, during the quarter, we saw no unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19. With respect to the P&L, quarter one revenue of $1.072 billion increased 11.3% over the first quarter of 2019 with strong contributions from both our Clinical Development Services segment, which grew 7.6%; and our Laboratory Services segment, which grew 30.6% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million increased 17.3% over the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Let me begin by saying that through quarter one, we did not experience a negative impact to cash flow as a result of COVID-19. In fact, our DSO declined in quarter one, 2020 to 39 days as compared to 41 days in quarter one of 2019, and we saw further improvement in our AR aging profile versus prior year. I'd add, in our preliminary April results, we have seen no deterioration in any of these metrics. Rather, we've seen an increase in our cash collections and our cash balance versus March. While this is good news, it is not surprising to us, given the strength of our large biopharma and biotech customer balance sheets and what has remained a healthy funding environment. Further, as we've shared previously, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is in Phase IIb or later studies, which tend to be lower risk and better funded than earlier stage assets. Despite these positive dynamics, out of an abundance of caution given the volatility in global markets, we drew down $150 million from our $300 million revolving credit facility and parked it as cash on our balance sheet. Inclusive of the revolver draw, we ended quarter one with cash and cash equivalents of $738 million, which is our largest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years and equates to approximately four years of annual cash interest expense. I'd also point out that historically, our cash conversion is meaningfully lower during the first quarter of the year due to the payout of the annual incentive compensation awards. As a result, setting aside potential COVID-19 impacts, we would otherwise expect to see stronger cash flows in the quarter two through quarter four period as compared to the first quarter. With the above, we feel we are in strong shape in terms of our cash and liquidity position. Turning to the capital structure. On our last call, we had previously guided to reducing our net leverage ratio to the low 4s by the end of this year and into the 3s next year. We've made great progress towards this target with net leverage dropping from 6.9x pre-IPO at the start of the year to 4.7x immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of quarter one. In addition, our capital structure has ample flexibility with our nearest maturity or material debt maturity not until August 2022, and we have only one covenant of note, which relates to our revolver, which states that net secured leverage can't be higher than 5.0x. As of quarter one, our actual net secured leverage ratio was 3.1x, which is almost 40% below this threshold. Put another way, if you hold our cash balance static, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $300 million for us to trigger the covenant. Turning to forward-looking guidance. Given the uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we are withdrawing our full year guidance. However, to assist investors in understanding the near-term outlook, we are providing financial guidance for the next quarter on an exceptional basis on today's call. As you heard in David and Bill's remarks, the COVID-19 pandemic will have negative impacts from sponsor holds and disruption from the pandemic on patient enrollment, site start-up and monitoring in our Clinical segment and reduced samples volumes in our central labs. These impacts will be partially offset by revenues from faster burning COVID-19 awards and actions to manage our cost base, including the employee Choice program and executive pay freezes discussed earlier, slowdowns of nonessential hirings in areas where demand is reduced, lower employee travel expense and managing corporate costs and other actions. With that in mind, our second quarter two020 guidance is: revenues of $907 million to $946 million, which equates to a minus 9% to minus 5% decline versus quarter two of 2019; adjusted EBITDA of $170 million to $177 million, which equates to a minus 12% to a minus 8% decline versus quarter two of 2019 on an as-reported basis. So to wrap things up, quarter one was an exceptional quarter from both a commercial and financial perspective despite expanded COVID-19-related impacts in the second half of March. While we expect the impacts from the pandemic to increase in quarter two, our robust liquidity and extensive state of mitigation efforts have helped us to navigate the crisis to date and positions us well for strong growth post COVID-19. With that, I'll now hand over to the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hi, good morning. I appreciate you're not giving full year guidance. But as we think about sites getting back up and reopened, I'm wondering if you could just give us some general parameters as to how you're thinking about number of sites that may be accessible in the back half of the year and by year-end? And how will Acurian help get \u2013 sites get back up and running faster?\nDavid Simmons: Yes. Thanks, Tycho, for the question. I'll start this, and then you may want Chris and Bill to comment on the two follow-up points of what we're looking at relative to financial impacts and then how we see Acurian and our site network through the year. So first, I'd say, it's a very difficult question because we don't know how the recovery is going to come, and we don't feel it would be prudent to try to project whether this is V shaped, U shaped or some other shape. We do think, and in our Q2 guidance, we have the impact that's at its most extreme form that we've faced thus far continuing through the second quarter. So that might be one point that helps. As we see sites coming back on, we probably have the most positive example based on what's happening in China. We don't forecast that Western Europe and U.S. will follow the speed of recovery that happened in China. Maybe that's conservative. In retrospect, we might look back and say it was conservative, but that's what we've currently planned. Let me see if Chris and then Bill want to add anything to that.\nChris Scully: The only thing I would add is, I think, David, your comments apply to what we've forecasted for our quarter two kind of business. That doesn't mean operationally that we're not prepared to kind of accelerate kind of things if the pandemic's impacts are slower than that.\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes. Tycho, this is Bill. As David mentioned, China is a comparator, but we're not sure it's the best comparator because activity has accelerated faster than we thought it would and forecasted it would. We've seen project initiations increase, IRB approvals increase, contract negotiations increase, site initiation visits increase, enrollments increasing, site audits are increasing. And based on our data and survey data we've seen suggests that they're back and sort of have recovered about 60%. Don't \u2013 as David said, don't expect the same necessary trajectory in Europe and in the U.S., but we are prepared. So from a resourcing perspective, we're in really good shape. So our site network, look, we think this is a good asset to have in our mix of services, and it can be used as a rescue mechanism for delayed studies, and we're in those kinds of conversations with customers. It's true it does have a fixed cost base associated with it that needs to be covered, but that's clearly offset by its strategic value and its use by customers and its uniqueness. So it's early days, but we think this is a good asset and part of the solution to help delayed clinical trials.\nTycho Peterson: That's helpful. And then for the follow-up on the 2Q guidance, are you able to give us any color on clinical versus lab? How you're thinking about one versus the other?\nChris Scully: Thanks for the question, Tycho. I think the answer to that is that we don't plan on giving specific guidance beyond what we have for the total company at the segment level. That said, per Bill's comments earlier on as well as some of the ones I made in the prepared comments for the call, we did kind of indicate that our clinical business is more greatly impacted than our labs business. So in our labs business, specifically, we have lower sample volumes in the central labs. However, that's less than 1/3 of the total business. BioA and GMP are impacted by less of a degree. It's likely that they're not going to continue to grow at the same rate that they had in quarter one, given it was a phenomenal growth rate. That said, we continue to expect for them to grow faster than the market.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the collaboration that you're seeing between you and clients and the FDA. So maybe if you can just kind of like give some more examples and color there. And also, as you think longer-term post COVID, what do you think of the \u2013 the FDA has been a lot more flexible. What do you think is going to stick post COVID? And if you think about the approach that clients have, clients that are bringing new RFPs on, are they starting to think kind of like longer-term beyond COVID of making changes and adding things as a result of what we're seeing now?\nDavid Simmons: The last part of the question, when you say adding things, could you be a little more specific?\nRicky Goldwasser: Meaning, when we kind of talked in the past about RFPs, I think there was this sense that some of the remote monitoring capabilities, right, we're not as entrenched in those RFPs. So are you starting to see clients having conversations that think about how are we thinking about trial design post COVID or are all the conversation focused on the here and now?\nDavid Simmons: Okay. And that's also linked to the second part of the question around FDA flexibility. You're hitting on the same thing?\nRicky Goldwasser: That's right.\nDavid Simmons: Okay. Let me take those two at the back, and then we'll see if we have some examples of collaboration that are going to hit the mark on this. So as we had in the prepared remarks, we do think that there'll be an accelerated adoption of virtual digital technologies into trials to be more patient-centric, to remove the burden on the patient, to be able to take more of the trial to the patient as opposed to the patient having to come to a physical infrastructure. The ability to do that is different across different therapeutic areas and different studies. So I wouldn't look at this as one big general statement. It's going to be very nuanced, but some studies do lend themselves towards more virtualization, if you can accept that term. So the way we look at it in terms of trying to sense the acceleration of adoption, you've hit on two of them. One is the regulators' posture towards adoption of these technologies and deviations to more status quo approaches to trial conduct. Second is readiness of the digital and virtual technologies to be applied to studies. Let me just tick that one off now. That looks really solid. The technologies work. They're able to go. So you give that one a box tick. And then the third that you hit on is clients' willingness to challenge the status quo and adopt these new technologies into the studies. So if I pick that off, let's go with customers first because the number of customer engagements that's been going on with us has not changed pre COVID and post COVID, meaning the volume of interactions we have are just as significant and robust as pre the crisis. They're just happening all over virtual technologies like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WebEx, things like that. In those conversations, there is a dramatic increase in the volume of conversations around adapting these technologies into studies. Twofold. First is adopting the technologies and approaches into studies that are already actively in process in our backlog. We've got active conversations of changes to be considered being put in on 10% of the active studies that were running in our backlog. So that's a dramatic increase in volume of real discussions to modify the protocols to adopt these technologies. And the conversations have extended into future pipeline for the customers. So on that collaboration, I would give you that volume has increased dramatically from pre COVID to in the midst of COVID, and it's not just related to the COVID studies. It's also related to future pipeline. So that's one of the major reasons we said that we see an accelerated adoption. Now on the regulatory side, the regulators \u2013 and we're not just focused on the FDA. Regulators around the world have given guidance during the pandemic to help studies continue and to help patients continue to receive medicines, continue to participate in the studies because it may be part of the practice of care and be very important to them. So they're accepting deviations to the protocols to use these types of technologies. We've had cases of the Italian regulators, when the hospitals were overwhelmed, were allowing patients in a study that couldn't get into an investigator site that was burdened by COVID-19 treatment of patients to go to another site on the study that was not shut down due to COVID-19 treatments and continue the protocol there. So that's an example. It's not technology based. They also accepted the use of televisits for patient follow up. So that's an example of regulators leaning in. The big question we have, and we don't know the answer to is post pandemic, do the regulators continue to be embracing the use of these type of technologies or do they shift back to a more conservative approach of back to the status quo of trials. And that point, we don't know. But given all those three dimensions, customers have clearly leaned into this more and their appetite to apply these technologies is greater. Regulators have shown more flexibility during the pandemic, but the big question is, will they continue that post pandemic.\nRicky Goldwasser: And just a quick follow-up there. Are there any \u2013 given the change in client appetite, are there any strategic assets that you think that are interesting for you to add to meet this change in appetite and demand?\nDavid Simmons: Not specifically. We're generally on the lookout beyond the partnerships and investments we have as we engage on specific trials and look at the right deployment of digital and virtual technologies onto each of these trials, how much are covered by partners we already work with on the technology and virtualization side. And as we see things that might be missing, and it's not always technology related. Some of it is also nontechnology related to be able to enable the trial going to the patient's home, for example. So we're keeping an eye on this and screening, but we don't have anything specifically that we think we need at this point.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJack Rogoff: Great, thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Rogoff on for Bob. Can you help us understand the 31% growth in the Lab segment? It sounded like a good amount of vaccine work and GMP capacity uptake. I'm curious how much of this was more of a lumpy pull forward of higher capacity build-outs versus more sustainable growth for you guys?\nChris Scully: So this is Chris. I'll start with that and Bill may want to fill in some additional details beyond what I share. But quarter one growth in Labs was a result of a combination of favorable factors, including what we ended with last year is a really robust starting backlog. Second is the authorizations wins that we had in the current quarter. That led to faster expected customer utilization of some of the capacity expansions that we did last year. And we also benefited from major accelerations in a vaccines development program at one of our key customers. So it was a combination of multiple factors that went into it. I don't know if, Bill, you'd like to add something?\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes. Maybe just to add some color to Chris' commentary. We've got a diverse set of laboratories. We think they are one, two or three in their respective niches. And we're a recognized leader in our labs. So your question was, is this lumpy? Well, we \u2013 in Q1, you can see our authorization results and Labs were certainly a big contributor to that, and we've had strong authorization growth. So look, we've added capacity, but we usually add capacity in a kind of a smart way. It's aligned with customer demand, but you have to build out enough capacity when you go the trouble and apply the CapEx to sustain you for a year or 2. So we certainly have enough capacity to grow, and we have a customer and market demand that suggests we're in a good space. We had an outstanding quarter in Q1, no doubt about it, but we feel good about our laboratory segment going forward.\nJack Rogoff: Got it. That's helpful. And then are you expecting any change in your CapEx outlook this year? Or are things progressing as normal in this area?\nChris Scully: Yes. We're not guiding specifically to where we'll end up in terms of CapEx for the year. We tend to be a business that's a little bit less capital-intensive than many others. So we've averaged around 4% of ASC 605 kind of sales per year, I think, a little bit below that on an ASC 606 basis. You may see us hold back slightly on some of these expenditures where we deem that they're nonessential given the pandemic and our desire to strengthen up liquidity. But we're going to continue to kind of invest at the same time where there's opportunities that we have a high degree of confidence or need and that are going to aid our customers.\nJack Rogoff: Make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning gentlemen. On \u2013 I wanted to get some follow-up on a comment that Bill has made a couple of times around China. You talked about \u2013 you gave us a litany of contracts, site activations, things like that. I'm wondering, since we kind of don't fully trust the data we see in the major kind of infection trackers. Are you seeing any spike in infection rate that would worry you that you would have to kind of retrench back into a more restricted environment in China? Or is that continuing to progress without inhibition?\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes, Dave, I couldn't comment on the infection rate in China overall. I'll leave that to international health authorities in China. All I can do is tell you what we've seen in our business. This is an interesting factoid and makes me really happy, but none of our employees in China contracted the virus so far, which is amazing. And reviewing with our team the progress that's being made, I'm just suggesting that we're seeing activity resume in China. The metrics in the month of, recently have suggested that there's an uptick in activity in China. So that's positive, and we're going to see what happens. But I couldn't really comment on the infection rate in that country or anything of that nature.\nDave Windley: Got it. I was just digging for, have you and your business had to rein back at any point in the last, say, couple of months, but it sounds like no. The second question that I wanted to explore was around your cost controls, which seemed pretty significant. I guess, quantitatively, I'm basically looking at a kind of 1Q to 2Q sequential decremental margin that is lower than your reported EBITDA margin in the first quarter. So kind of looks like you're reducing costs by more than 100% of your costs. And I hear you talking about putting capacity in place for COVID-related trials. You have a lab business that obviously has a fair amount of fixed capacity in it. And I just want to better understand where you're able to pull levers on cost to mitigate the impact to EBITDA as you go into 2Q?\nChris Scully: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'm not sure if we kind of look at the math the same way that you're looking at. As I kind of look at it, our margin improved slightly from I believe it's about 18.4% in quarter one to 18.7% next quarter. That does have embedded within it a fair degree of cost control. One thing you have to keep in mind is in terms of the staffing or the resourcing is to the extent that there are kind of colleagues that would not have demand if it weren't for COVID-19 awards, we're able, in large part, to kind of shift some of those bodies where they have the capabilities to support the COVID-19 kind of work. That's what David referred to in his section about basically people being cross-trained and really having a great degree of flexibility, which has been part and parcel of how we've been able to manage our cost base as tightly as we have the last several years. So that adaptability and flexibility definitely plays out favorably amidst a crisis like this.\nDave Windley: Okay. But it does suggest that you're actually assuming greater productivity sequentially despite the disruption and having to shift people around.\nBill Sharbaugh: Dave, this is Bill. I might answer it in this way. Look, personnel is the biggest cost in our business, right? And \u2013 given its nature, so utilization is key to us and we have a lot of capability here analytically and to control that. And to your point, given the current situation, there's a lot of tension between cost containment and the expected increase in demand. Look, we certainly slowed hiring. Our utilization is holding up pretty good. It's certainly not a target, as you would expect. And we have taken an approach of reallocating team members between projects and shifting team members between functions in some cases. And so overall, our priority is quality and ensuring that we can keep business continuity for customers and studies and patients. And so we're doing that through a variety of mechanisms, and we're poised as recovery occurs to take advantage of that. Now look, clearly, a lot of other drivers of cost, travel costs have gone way down, et cetera. David mentioned some activities in his commentary. And we've had employees who have voluntarily chosen to reduce their hours in the Choice program that David mentioned. So I mean, we have a lot of levers we're pulling on the cost side appropriately with the situation, but we are poised to recover.\nDave Windley: Okay, thank you.\nChris Scully: Yes. Just one other thing to add, Dave, on the question is, as you know, these are some complicated kind of businesses. So in addition to all those things, which we're doing to kind of manage some other factors could skew the percentages a little bit here and there, including the FX rates for the quarter, the ratio of indirects to directs, what we're kind of doing in our variable compensation. So a series of those things could also twist it. But basically, overall, I think the story is, is that, that this is a team that has a lot of experience in terms of managing utilization and staffing, and we do a great job at that, and this is not the first time we've been at it, and we're going to execute this really well in quarter two.\nDave Windley: Excellent, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. Can you tell us how well are the Phase I clinics holding up? I would think they're probably getting hit harder than some of your other areas.\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes, John, this is Bill. Our Phase I clinics are part of our early development services business, which is in clinical. And so it's a subset of that broad category defined as early development. Look, we \u2013 what we did as the situation was developing in March. We finished out ongoing studies that were near completion for clients. We took a look at the situation. We decided to shut down that clinic. We furloughed some of the employees, and we thought that was the right thing to do because we didn't want to domicile healthy normal patients based on all the guidance from international, national and our local health authorities. So I would \u2013 we looked at the marketplace. We saw about half of those providing those services, kept them open and some reduced capacity and about half closed. We are in the camp of closing because we thought that was the right thing to do. So that's a subset of our business. We have clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Austin, Texas and in Orlando, Florida. And we're in the process of planning for reopening, depending on how the virus progresses, but I would see us taking a phased approach where these open up at the end of Q2 for a small subset of studies, a whole bunch of new procedures put in place. And then through the course of Q3, ramp up and then be at full capacity in Q4. That's how we're sort of thinking of our Phase I clinics. There's a lot of detail around it, but our team has done an excellent job, and we think we've done the right thing as a company to protect both our staff and patients.\nDavid Simmons: John, it's David. One thing to add \u2013 one thing to emphasize what Bill said and then something to add. First thing to emphasize is that colleague and patient safety has come first. Of the three objectives that we're working on, if they ever come in conflict, colleague and patient safety wins. Hence, the very fast decision to shut down the clinics. That's the point I would emphasize, Bill brought up. The point I would add is that customer demand for these services is very strong. So customers are \u2013 keep asking us when are we going to be able to reopen the Phase I clinics.\nJohn Kreger: That's very helpful. And then a follow-up around the site network. I'm guessing the patient flow there is better than what you're seeing in sites that you don't own or manage. Any metrics that you could provide on that? I'm just curious how your site network patient volumes might have trended in the quarter compared to the other sites where you work?\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes, John, this is Bill. So first of all, our site network has remained open, okay? Number one. Number two, ongoing clinical trials, many ongoing clinical trials have continued, albeit at a slower pace. And then some clinical trials have been put on hold by customers because they represented these at-risk patient populations that I mentioned earlier, immunocompromised patients or elderly patients. So it's a bit of a mixed bag there. The key thing is it has remained open, they are screening, recruiting and enrolling patients. And as I said, it's a rescue mechanism for ongoing clinical trials, and we're having discussions with customers around that right now. We put into place a couple of virtual solutions to help keep patients engaged and enrolled in those trials. Customers are very concerned about patients lost to follow-up. We've been able to maintain a lot of continuity there. So we have experienced some studies that are delayed to enrollment or paused on enrollment just because of the nature of those patients, but it's remained open, and many studies are continuing. So we think as recovery strengthens that our site network is going to be a great solution. And then those studies that are on pause are going to resume.\nJohn Kreger: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Erin Wright of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. Biotech funding, I would expect to be a little bit more volatile, obviously, in this environment. I mean, what are you seeing and hearing across that cohort of customers compared to large pharma?\nDavid Simmons: Thanks for that question, Erin. First, I'm going to say that biotech funding looks as robust as it's ever been in Q1. What we're seeing is funding from IPO and debt financing, probably off a little bit or flattish, but funding from venture capital increased in Q1. So the total was a very robust funding environment. So we're not seeing any signs of funding weakness on the biotech front. Second part is we continue to see cash on balance sheets of the funded biotech companies sitting at about two to three and trending to the three-year number in terms of cash on the balance sheet at current levels of R&D spending. So those are those two elements of the amount of capital flowing in and the amount of cash on balance sheets that the well-funded biotech companies are sitting on are both as strong as they've ever been. So that's the first point. The second is, I think, specific to PPD, I would bring out, which is in our backlog, if you look at the authorizations in our backlog from our biotech customers, approximately 80% of that award volume is for Phase II and later stage studies, which tend to be lower risk studies than the earlier stage biotech study. So you got an overall funding environment is strong and then the particular types of work we do in the later stages of development, which makes up on a dollar value, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is relatively less risky.\nErin Wright: Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned the success you're seeing in COVID-related business wins. How should we be thinking about how meaningful those are from a financial perspective?\nDavid Simmons: Yes. A couple of things to consider, as you think about them is, one, they're fast burning. So this is \u2013 tends to be revenue that's going to run this year and into 2021. So that's the first point. Second is, we think that the COVID book of work is dynamic meaning, you've got a lot \u2013 the industry has really responded rapidly and are doing a lot of testing of scientific hypothesis around COVID. And some are going to be good hypothesis that will get early data that's positive, and others will be not so good hypothesis. So I would expect with the awards that are coming in, some will cancel, some will expand. And we've already seen some expansions in the work we've won. So we mentioned 39 awards. Another way to think about this is that 39 awards, about 2/3 of those awards are for treatments, 1/3 of those awards are for vaccines. So the first and fastest kind of runs out of the blocks were the treatment programs, and those that had really good early data have already expanded scope. So another thing to think about is as you see awards, they're starting in the earlier stage. But if the data comes out very positively, you can see rapid expansions of these programs. An example of that is we had one treatment program that we were working on, where our original scoping was to enroll approximately 700 patients. Within four weeks and the early data readouts on that, the scope expansion went to well over 6,000 patients. I mean it's just a rapid and massive increase in scope. And Bill talked about our people going 24 hours a day, trying to make sure that we're able to enroll patients and get medicines to patients. That's actually tied to this specific example. Vaccines are lagging a little bit because it's being tested in healthy volunteers. But I would expect that the good vaccines programs are going to see scope expansion start to pop in Q2. Now the question is, you've got this double force, which early data readouts aren't going to be so positive, so there could be some cancellations or just the studies stop after that early stage. And then others where the data is positive is going to be relatively large scope expansions. And then because that's why we do these studies, it's hard to project what the volume is going to be in the future.\nErin Wright: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Juan Avendano of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJuan Avendano: Hi, thank you. Can you give us an update on the percentage of your overall patients that you are able to recruit from your site network? And also, what is the percentage of your sites that are exclusively dedicated to clinical research and thus potentially seeing a smaller impact from health care resources being diverted to COVID-19?\nDavid Simmons: I'm sorry, can I get the second part of your question again, Juan?\nJuan Avendano: Yes. And so what is the percentage of your overall sites that are exclusively dedicated to clinical research and thus potentially seeing a smaller impact from health care resources being diverted to COVID-19?\nDavid Simmons: Okay. I mean, we don't have the specific data to disclose on either of those fronts, but let me try to help with the questions. On the percent of patients related to our site network versus other site networks, say proportionality hasn't changed through this COVID-19 crisis, meaning the majority of patients are still flowing through the traditional site network versus the 180 sites we have. I would say that we, on our sites, while they're open and patients have been resilient, meaning patients are willing to participate in clinical trial conduct, the biggest factor affecting our own site network has been customer holds. Where if you flip and go to the traditional investigator sites, the biggest impact has been investigator sites as part of hospitals that are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. And there's severe impediments to our ability to do on-site activity, which Bill framed the proportionality in his opening comments. So you have this kind of different impact from COVID in our sites, which is more driven by customer holds in proportionality standpoint and zero impact on the sites being opened from the pandemic versus traditional sites, which are more impacted by the pandemic than from customer holds. So that would be, to try to help inform your question without disclosing the specific numbers you're asking for. Bill, is there anything you want to add to that?\nBill Sharbaugh: No. I think you hit it.\nJuan Avendano: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Thanks for taking the questions. David, you mentioned during the prepared remarks, that you think COVID could actually have a net positive impact on the overall R&D spend, I think, for biopharma. I was wondering in that context, a topic we've tried to think about is when we look out beyond 2020, the ability for CROs to [Audio Dip] So could you just speak a little bit about, maybe give a little more color on the overall level of R&D and COVID impact? And is there an ability, is there a slack capacity, whether it be at the sites, investigators or in CRAs to actually have an ability to catch up for what's been delayed?\nDavid Simmons: Yes. I think there's \u2013 you were getting cut off in the question, but I think the question had two parts is what was behind the statement of believing that this COVID experience will have a positive effect on R&D investment. And then I think your second question was around what \u2013 how do we see the complexity or challenge of catch-up once we get back to normalcy. So assuming that was the gist of the questions. So on the first piece, the statement on R&D investment levels is not a technically based feeling or belief. It's twofold. It's one, that I think with the pandemic going out, I think society is realizing that in the face of extreme health challenges or risks to health, where does one turn for solutions? And the innovative biopharma and biotech industries is the place that's mobilized on their own at speed and at pace and are having real impacts already. I mean, just if we look at remdesivir's approval and the amount of work going on. So one, I think since all the, maybe pre COVID, you may have seen just the general narrative out in the public being one that's more negative to the industry because of drug pricing and a political focus on drug pricing. I think society is probably seeing very clearly the role that this industry plays. So I think the belief and the importance of this industry to society is pronounced in this. That's the main driver behind the R&D investment levels. I think probably a sub chapter of that is maybe a renewed focus in public-private and what I believe would lead to a public-private discussion on infectious disease preparedness, which maybe was lacking a bit, heading into this. So that's the first piece on the R&D investment side. On the recovery side, this is a really tough topic, and it's one that we spend a lot of time on, and business by business within the total of PPD, it looks different. But fundamentally, we have to be prepared for different types of recovery curves, whether they be V shaped, U shaped or W shaped with reoccurrence of the pandemic. But we do believe that we're going to get back to a point where we're going to have to run whatever time period, let's say, it's fourth quarter. Again, we don't know what it's going to be. Let's say, fourth quarter, where we get back to the requirement where we've got to run the full expected book of work for that quarter that was planned. And then we have all of this catch-up work for delayed activities that have gone on. So resourcing becomes very, very important. And this is why we've been very loathe to take draconian actions on our cost base. Our leaders have done a great job adapting resourcing and reshifting resourcing to keep utilization as high as we can, but it has taken a bit of a knock. And this Choice program has been key. So people are managing their lives better, but we haven't given up that capacity, that flex capacity to come back in. But we do believe when that period of time hits where we have to do our normally planned volume of work and do the catch up work, that we're going to have to ramp up hiring. And the timing of the ramp-up of hiring at or in advance of this spike is something PPD does really well and calibrates really well. And we're going to have \u2013 this is going to test our ability probably unlike any other spike buildup that we've seen in the past. I just want to see if Bill wants to add anything to this.\nBill Sharbaugh: Yes. David, I think you framed it quite well. I think the challenges aren't technical in nature. It's going to be access to sites, right? So access is a challenge. Clearly, there's new procedures that will be in place that various countries, institutions, et cetera, will put into place. And we and you will have to react to that so that our CRAs are prepared and able to enter those sites. And then it's the nature of our business. It's core. But clearly, there's a lot of protocol amendments that have been put in place around clinical trials as we've added digital services, as we're in a rescue mode, opening up new sites, catching up on activities that are required to be done at the site. We've done a lot of this work in advance, as I've said, to the extent we can to start-up a new clinical trial. But that's our bread and butter, those protocol amendments. And like David said, from a resourcing perspective, we're planning for recovery and ready for recovery.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Simmons for closing remarks.\nDavid Simmons: Yes. I want to thank everyone that participated in the call. We appreciate your time and allocation of time to PPD. As you can tell, we're very pleased with the quarter one results, but that's behind us now. Our full focus is on managing PPD and being part of the solution to this pandemic as we go through Q2 and into the rest of 2020. So again, thank you for your time, and we'll close the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "David Simmons",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 2020 earnings call. I'd like to start by saying I hope you, your families and your colleagues are safe amidst the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our collective focus on COVID 19, in addition to reviewing our Q1 results, we plan to spend a sizable amount of our time this morning discussing the impact to our business stemming from the virus as well as our ability to minimize the negative impacts and to continue playing a critical role, aiding solution development in the form of treatments and vaccines. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we've withdrawn our previously issued guidance for the full year 2020 and today, are issuing new guidance for the second quarter, which Chris will cover in his remarks. Regarding the first quarter results, during the quarter, we saw strong growth across both key commercial and P&L metrics. A few highlights include: net authorizations of $1.06 billion resulting in a Q1 net book-to-bill of 1.3x and notably, we did not see any unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19; a record ending backlog of $7.3 billion, an increase of 11.9% year-on-year; double-digit P&L growth with revenue of $1.07 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million, representing 11.3% and 17.3% growth versus the prior year, respectively, with strong underlying contributions from both our clinical and laboratory segments, which had top line growth of 8% and 31%, respectively; ending cash of $738 million, our highest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years; continued progress on our balance sheet objectives, with net leverage declining from 6.9x as of Q4 to 4.7x, immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of the end of Q1. While we're pleased with our first quarter results, we continue to be focused on the here and now and managing through this pandemic. Fundamentally, clinical trials exist to address unmet patient needs, and these needs have not gone away as a result of the pandemic. In fact, PPD's purpose and mission have never been more clear and inspiring to our organization than they are at this time. The pandemic has presented headwinds to our business, yet we feel confident that the mitigating actions we've taken and the tailwinds we are experiencing from COVID-19-related work will allow us to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position. During our Q4 earnings call, I shared PPD's three priorities related to COVID-19 and I'd like to provide an update across these priorities. First, our main priority is employee and patient safety. We quickly organized a Pandemic Committee, co-chaired by our Chief Medical Officer and Chief HR Officer to protect colleague and patient safety. Through this team's leadership, we quickly moved to remote work for all remote-capable employees, closed domiciling at our Phase I clinics and instituted measures across our offices, sites and labs to maximize employee safety. Our second priority has been business continuity with the dual goals of delivering for our customers and maintaining financial strength. Across both of these goals, we entered the pandemic from a position of strength. Our long-standing reputation of delivery excellence coupled with our investments in owned-site networks, digital and virtual trial solutions and remote site monitoring tools have enabled us to provide trial continuity solutions for our customers. Our teams are working hand-in-hand with our customers to ensure continuity of their studies. And our customers are looking for our guidance and partnership related to digital and virtual solutions across their pipelines. Bill will provide further details on this front, but the power of our enterprise to fulfill customers' needs has never been more clear. Although more than half of active investigator sites have been impacted, we have adapted and shifted our resources to continue to make progress on our customer studies, such as focusing our team on the trial work not related to site visits and shifting available resources to support new COVID-19 clinical trials. The adaptability of our organization across all levels, our low turnover and the cross-training of our team members continues to embed confidence in our customers that PPD is their partner of choice through this pandemic. Regarding financial strength, it has been important to PPD to maintain our balance sheet while minimizing the impact to our talented colleagues. We have taken a balanced approach to cost mitigation and implemented a program we call Choice, where employees are permitted to take a short-term sabbatical or temporary hours reduction. With more than 600 employees taking us up on this entirely voluntary program, it is clear that this was a needed offering for employees to balance work and family needs while delivering cost savings to the company. Most importantly, this program positions us well to quickly mobilize resources as sites resume clinical trial activity. This last point is critical because we believe when we do get back to something close to normalcy, we will have to execute on our full plan of work plus catch-up work that has been building up. In addition to the Choice program, we have implemented a suite of more typical cost control actions, including fast and severe restrictions on travel, a salary freeze for executive management and paused hiring in areas where demand is delayed while still adding targeted resources for areas of work expansion such as COVID-19-related work. Speaking of COVID-19 work, we are proud to be an active part of the solution to this pandemic. The strength of our infectious diseases and vaccines franchises with experience on 300 trials over the last five years, coupled with our regulatory expertise in this space, has allowed us to build a leadership position in COVID-19-related vaccines and treatments, with 39 awards to date, spanning our clinical and lab segments. We continue to be actively involved in bidding on several dozen additional clinical trials targeting COVID-19. In anticipation of the growing demand for our services, we are proactively building capacity across functions to partner with our customers as they tackle treatment and vaccine development for COVID-19. As you'll recall from the Q4 earnings call, I mentioned that we quickly mobilized a team who has proactively engaged all companies that have announced COVID-19 work in the public domain. I did not expect at that time the depth and breadth of studies that would launch. It has been incredible to see the power of the industry and how fast our customers have turned on a dime to address this global health crisis. And our team has reacted just as quickly. Current treatment studies that we're partnered on are projected to enroll upwards of 13,000 patients. Looking forward, we remain fundamentally bullish about the outlook for PPD in our industry. This pandemic represents a dramatic real-world example of the value the innovative life sciences industry provides to society. I expect this crisis to have a positive impact to R&D investment levels in the coming years as well as aiding accelerated adoption of innovative approaches to trial conduct. We are also experiencing even greater collaboration between pharma sponsors, CROs and regulators, which bodes well for the future of innovative new medicines. Lastly, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 examples I discussed, we believe our differentiated services, unique customer engagement model and continued commitment to operational excellence, will be increasingly important to customers and positions us well for continued strong growth post this pandemic. I'd like to close by saying how proud I am of our 24,000-plus colleagues around the world. Their willingness to go above and beyond for our customers and patients, while exercising caution to blunt the spread of the virus has been truly remarkable, and I'm thankful for their dedication and hard work. We'll continue to provide updates on this topic in the coming quarters as the situation evolves. I'll now turn it over to Bill Sharbaugh, our Chief Operating Officer, to review our operating results. Yes. Thanks, Tycho, for the question. I'll start this, and then you may want Chris and Bill to comment on the two follow-up points of what we're looking at relative to financial impacts and then how we see Acurian and our site network through the year. So first, I'd say, it's a very difficult question because we don't know how the recovery is going to come, and we don't feel it would be prudent to try to project whether this is V shaped, U shaped or some other shape. We do think, and in our Q2 guidance, we have the impact that's at its most extreme form that we've faced thus far continuing through the second quarter. So that might be one point that helps. As we see sites coming back on, we probably have the most positive example based on what's happening in China. We don't forecast that Western Europe and U.S. will follow the speed of recovery that happened in China. Maybe that's conservative. In retrospect, we might look back and say it was conservative, but that's what we've currently planned. Let me see if Chris and then Bill want to add anything to that. The last part of the question, when you say adding things, could you be a little more specific? Okay. And that's also linked to the second part of the question around FDA flexibility. You're hitting on the same thing? Okay. Let me take those two at the back, and then we'll see if we have some examples of collaboration that are going to hit the mark on this. So as we had in the prepared remarks, we do think that there'll be an accelerated adoption of virtual digital technologies into trials to be more patient-centric, to remove the burden on the patient, to be able to take more of the trial to the patient as opposed to the patient having to come to a physical infrastructure. The ability to do that is different across different therapeutic areas and different studies. So I wouldn't look at this as one big general statement. It's going to be very nuanced, but some studies do lend themselves towards more virtualization, if you can accept that term. So the way we look at it in terms of trying to sense the acceleration of adoption, you've hit on two of them. One is the regulators' posture towards adoption of these technologies and deviations to more status quo approaches to trial conduct. Second is readiness of the digital and virtual technologies to be applied to studies. Let me just tick that one off now. That looks really solid. The technologies work. They're able to go. So you give that one a box tick. And then the third that you hit on is clients' willingness to challenge the status quo and adopt these new technologies into the studies. So if I pick that off, let's go with customers first because the number of customer engagements that's been going on with us has not changed pre COVID and post COVID, meaning the volume of interactions we have are just as significant and robust as pre the crisis. They're just happening all over virtual technologies like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WebEx, things like that. In those conversations, there is a dramatic increase in the volume of conversations around adapting these technologies into studies. Twofold. First is adopting the technologies and approaches into studies that are already actively in process in our backlog. We've got active conversations of changes to be considered being put in on 10% of the active studies that were running in our backlog. So that's a dramatic increase in volume of real discussions to modify the protocols to adopt these technologies. And the conversations have extended into future pipeline for the customers. So on that collaboration, I would give you that volume has increased dramatically from pre COVID to in the midst of COVID, and it's not just related to the COVID studies. It's also related to future pipeline. So that's one of the major reasons we said that we see an accelerated adoption. Now on the regulatory side, the regulators \u2013 and we're not just focused on the FDA. Regulators around the world have given guidance during the pandemic to help studies continue and to help patients continue to receive medicines, continue to participate in the studies because it may be part of the practice of care and be very important to them. So they're accepting deviations to the protocols to use these types of technologies. We've had cases of the Italian regulators, when the hospitals were overwhelmed, were allowing patients in a study that couldn't get into an investigator site that was burdened by COVID-19 treatment of patients to go to another site on the study that was not shut down due to COVID-19 treatments and continue the protocol there. So that's an example. It's not technology based. They also accepted the use of televisits for patient follow up. So that's an example of regulators leaning in. The big question we have, and we don't know the answer to is post pandemic, do the regulators continue to be embracing the use of these type of technologies or do they shift back to a more conservative approach of back to the status quo of trials. And that point, we don't know. But given all those three dimensions, customers have clearly leaned into this more and their appetite to apply these technologies is greater. Regulators have shown more flexibility during the pandemic, but the big question is, will they continue that post pandemic. Not specifically. We're generally on the lookout beyond the partnerships and investments we have as we engage on specific trials and look at the right deployment of digital and virtual technologies onto each of these trials, how much are covered by partners we already work with on the technology and virtualization side. And as we see things that might be missing, and it's not always technology related. Some of it is also nontechnology related to be able to enable the trial going to the patient's home, for example. So we're keeping an eye on this and screening, but we don't have anything specifically that we think we need at this point. John, it's David. One thing to add \u2013 one thing to emphasize what Bill said and then something to add. First thing to emphasize is that colleague and patient safety has come first. Of the three objectives that we're working on, if they ever come in conflict, colleague and patient safety wins. Hence, the very fast decision to shut down the clinics. That's the point I would emphasize, Bill brought up. The point I would add is that customer demand for these services is very strong. So customers are \u2013 keep asking us when are we going to be able to reopen the Phase I clinics. Thanks for that question, Erin. First, I'm going to say that biotech funding looks as robust as it's ever been in Q1. What we're seeing is funding from IPO and debt financing, probably off a little bit or flattish, but funding from venture capital increased in Q1. So the total was a very robust funding environment. So we're not seeing any signs of funding weakness on the biotech front. Second part is we continue to see cash on balance sheets of the funded biotech companies sitting at about two to three and trending to the three-year number in terms of cash on the balance sheet at current levels of R&D spending. So those are those two elements of the amount of capital flowing in and the amount of cash on balance sheets that the well-funded biotech companies are sitting on are both as strong as they've ever been. So that's the first point. The second is, I think, specific to PPD, I would bring out, which is in our backlog, if you look at the authorizations in our backlog from our biotech customers, approximately 80% of that award volume is for Phase II and later stage studies, which tend to be lower risk studies than the earlier stage biotech study. So you got an overall funding environment is strong and then the particular types of work we do in the later stages of development, which makes up on a dollar value, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is relatively less risky. Yes. A couple of things to consider, as you think about them is, one, they're fast burning. So this is \u2013 tends to be revenue that's going to run this year and into 2021. So that's the first point. Second is, we think that the COVID book of work is dynamic meaning, you've got a lot \u2013 the industry has really responded rapidly and are doing a lot of testing of scientific hypothesis around COVID. And some are going to be good hypothesis that will get early data that's positive, and others will be not so good hypothesis. So I would expect with the awards that are coming in, some will cancel, some will expand. And we've already seen some expansions in the work we've won. So we mentioned 39 awards. Another way to think about this is that 39 awards, about 2/3 of those awards are for treatments, 1/3 of those awards are for vaccines. So the first and fastest kind of runs out of the blocks were the treatment programs, and those that had really good early data have already expanded scope. So another thing to think about is as you see awards, they're starting in the earlier stage. But if the data comes out very positively, you can see rapid expansions of these programs. An example of that is we had one treatment program that we were working on, where our original scoping was to enroll approximately 700 patients. Within four weeks and the early data readouts on that, the scope expansion went to well over 6,000 patients. I mean it's just a rapid and massive increase in scope. And Bill talked about our people going 24 hours a day, trying to make sure that we're able to enroll patients and get medicines to patients. That's actually tied to this specific example. Vaccines are lagging a little bit because it's being tested in healthy volunteers. But I would expect that the good vaccines programs are going to see scope expansion start to pop in Q2. Now the question is, you've got this double force, which early data readouts aren't going to be so positive, so there could be some cancellations or just the studies stop after that early stage. And then others where the data is positive is going to be relatively large scope expansions. And then because that's why we do these studies, it's hard to project what the volume is going to be in the future. I'm sorry, can I get the second part of your question again, Juan? Okay. I mean, we don't have the specific data to disclose on either of those fronts, but let me try to help with the questions.

In my prepared comments on today's call, I'll be covering our quarter one results; updating you on our cash, liquidity position and capital structure, given increased investor focus on balance sheets amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; and lastly, providing you with an update on our forward guidance before opening up for Q&A. Before diving in, as Nate mentioned, throughout my comments when referring to our P&L, I'll be doing so on an ASC 606 basis. To that end, as you likely saw in our earnings release and investor supplement, we've now migrated our segment disclosures to be in an ASC 606 basis, based on how we now manage the business and to reduce the administrative burden of having to maintain and reconcile two sets of books. When referring to other metrics such as net authorizations, backlog, net book-to-bill ratios and DSOS, these will currently remain on a historical ASC 605 basis to maintain comparability for investors. However, we have additionally included in our investor press release and our investor supplement these metrics on an ASC 606 basis, both with and without indirects. In addition, given the exceptional circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we have expanded the operational and financial metrics that we are providing on this call, along with sharing quarterly guidance for quarter two. That said, I'd like to note that we are unlikely to provide similar levels of disclosure on an ongoing basis post the pandemic. Turning to quarter one. As David noted, the first quarter was strong for us in terms of awards, in which we booked $1.06 billion in net authorizations, resulting in a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.30x and a record ending-backlog of $7.31 billion, which is up 11.9% from quarter one, 2019. Putting this in context, the 1.30x net book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was our highest book-to-bill ratio in eight quarters, significantly above the 1.20x that has historically translated into double-digit revenue growth based on our backlog conversion rates. As David and Bill both noted, during the quarter, we saw no unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19. With respect to the P&L, quarter one revenue of $1.072 billion increased 11.3% over the first quarter of 2019 with strong contributions from both our Clinical Development Services segment, which grew 7.6%; and our Laboratory Services segment, which grew 30.6% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million increased 17.3% over the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Let me begin by saying that through quarter one, we did not experience a negative impact to cash flow as a result of COVID-19. In fact, our DSO declined in quarter one, 2020 to 39 days as compared to 41 days in quarter one of 2019, and we saw further improvement in our AR aging profile versus prior year. I'd add, in our preliminary April results, we have seen no deterioration in any of these metrics. Rather, we've seen an increase in our cash collections and our cash balance versus March. While this is good news, it is not surprising to us, given the strength of our large biopharma and biotech customer balance sheets and what has remained a healthy funding environment. Further, as we've shared previously, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is in Phase IIb or later studies, which tend to be lower risk and better funded than earlier stage assets. Despite these positive dynamics, out of an abundance of caution given the volatility in global markets, we drew down $150 million from our $300 million revolving credit facility and parked it as cash on our balance sheet. Inclusive of the revolver draw, we ended quarter one with cash and cash equivalents of $738 million, which is our largest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years and equates to approximately four years of annual cash interest expense. I'd also point out that historically, our cash conversion is meaningfully lower during the first quarter of the year due to the payout of the annual incentive compensation awards. As a result, setting aside potential COVID-19 impacts, we would otherwise expect to see stronger cash flows in the quarter two through quarter four period as compared to the first quarter. With the above, we feel we are in strong shape in terms of our cash and liquidity position. Turning to the capital structure. On our last call, we had previously guided to reducing our net leverage ratio to the low 4s by the end of this year and into the 3s next year. We've made great progress towards this target with net leverage dropping from 6.9x pre-IPO at the start of the year to 4.7x immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of quarter one. In addition, our capital structure has ample flexibility with our nearest maturity or material debt maturity not until August 2022, and we have only one covenant of note, which relates to our revolver, which states that net secured leverage can't be higher than 5.0x. As of quarter one, our actual net secured leverage ratio was 3.1x, which is almost 40% below this threshold. Put another way, if you hold our cash balance static, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $300 million for us to trigger the covenant. Turning to forward-looking guidance. Given the uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we are withdrawing our full year guidance. However, to assist investors in understanding the near-term outlook, we are providing financial guidance for the next quarter on an exceptional basis on today's call. As you heard in David and Bill's remarks, the COVID-19 pandemic will have negative impacts from sponsor holds and disruption from the pandemic on patient enrollment, site start-up and monitoring in our Clinical segment and reduced samples volumes in our central labs. These impacts will be partially offset by revenues from faster burning COVID-19 awards and actions to manage our cost base, including the employee Choice program and executive pay freezes discussed earlier, slowdowns of nonessential hirings in areas where demand is reduced, lower employee travel expense and managing corporate costs and other actions. With that in mind, our second quarter two020 guidance is: revenues of $907 million to $946 million, which equates to a minus 9% to minus 5% decline versus quarter two of 2019; adjusted EBITDA of $170 million to $177 million, which equates to a minus 12% to a minus 8% decline versus quarter two of 2019 on an as-reported basis. So to wrap things up, quarter one was an exceptional quarter from both a commercial and financial perspective despite expanded COVID-19-related impacts in the second half of March. While we expect the impacts from the pandemic to increase in quarter two, our robust liquidity and extensive state of mitigation efforts have helped us to navigate the crisis to date and positions us well for strong growth post COVID-19. With that, I'll now hand over to the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. The only thing I would add is, I think, David, your comments apply to what we've forecasted for our quarter two kind of business. That doesn't mean operationally that we're not prepared to kind of accelerate kind of things if the pandemic's impacts are slower than that. Thanks for the question, Tycho. I think the answer to that is that we don't plan on giving specific guidance beyond what we have for the total company at the segment level. That said, per Bill's comments earlier on as well as some of the ones I made in the prepared comments for the call, we did kind of indicate that our clinical business is more greatly impacted than our labs business. So in our labs business, specifically, we have lower sample volumes in the central labs. However, that's less than 1/3 of the total business. BioA and GMP are impacted by less of a degree. It's likely that they're not going to continue to grow at the same rate that they had in quarter one, given it was a phenomenal growth rate. That said, we continue to expect for them to grow faster than the market. So this is Chris. I'll start with that and Bill may want to fill in some additional details beyond what I share. But quarter one growth in Labs was a result of a combination of favorable factors, including what we ended with last year is a really robust starting backlog. Second is the authorizations wins that we had in the current quarter. That led to faster expected customer utilization of some of the capacity expansions that we did last year. And we also benefited from major accelerations in a vaccines development program at one of our key customers. So it was a combination of multiple factors that went into it. I don't know if, Bill, you'd like to add something? Yes. We're not guiding specifically to where we'll end up in terms of CapEx for the year. We tend to be a business that's a little bit less capital-intensive than many others. So we've averaged around 4% of ASC 605 kind of sales per year, I think, a little bit below that on an ASC 606 basis. You may see us hold back slightly on some of these expenditures where we deem that they're nonessential given the pandemic and our desire to strengthen up liquidity. But we're going to continue to kind of invest at the same time where there's opportunities that we have a high degree of confidence or need and that are going to aid our customers. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'm not sure if we kind of look at the math the same way that you're looking at. As I kind of look at it, our margin improved slightly from I believe it's about 18.4% in quarter one to 18.7% next quarter. That does have embedded within it a fair degree of cost control. One thing you have to keep in mind is in terms of the staffing or the resourcing is to the extent that there are kind of colleagues that would not have demand if it weren't for COVID-19 awards, we're able, in large part, to kind of shift some of those bodies where they have the capabilities to support the COVID-19 kind of work. That's what David referred to in his section about basically people being cross-trained and really having a great degree of flexibility, which has been part and parcel of how we've been able to manage our cost base as tightly as we have the last several years. So that adaptability and flexibility definitely plays out favorably amidst a crisis like this. Yes. Just one other thing to add, Dave, on the question is, as you know, these are some complicated kind of businesses. So in addition to all those things, which we're doing to kind of manage some other factors could skew the percentages a little bit here and there, including the FX rates for the quarter, the ratio of indirects to directs, what we're kind of doing in our variable compensation. So a series of those things could also twist it. But basically, overall, I think the story is, is that, that this is a team that has a lot of experience in terms of managing utilization and staffing, and we do a great job at that, and this is not the first time we've been at it, and we're going to execute this really well in quarter two."

            "name": "Bill Sharbaugh",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we saw continued operating momentum across the business with strong financial performance from both our segments. I would call out the exceptionally strong results within our Laboratory Services segment. Our labs produced organic revenue growth in excess of 30% versus prior year, resulting from strong authorizations, rapid customer uptake of new facility expansions in our GMP lab and increased FTE contracts in the vaccine lab. Given the focus on COVID-19, my comments will largely center on our business continuity efforts and how we are responding to the crisis. Our long-standing history of operational excellence, along with our unique mix of clinical and lab services, put us in a strong position heading into the pandemic. Before I go through the segments, I would note that while we are sharing certain operating metrics, as our peers have done, these are inherently difficult to compare across the space. I'll start with commentary on our Clinical Development Services business. Our clinical business is impacted in three ways. First, as David noted earlier, the majority of studies are continuing, and we haven't seen an increase in cancellations. But we have seen several sponsors implement enrollment pauses for studies that have not started or studies with at-risk patient populations, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. For those studies that have yet to start-up, some sponsors are requesting us to complete preenrollment tasks, such as country in-site selection, remote site initiation visits, study, design and planning and database building so that the new trial can start quickly once given the green light. Overall, we estimate that approximately 10% of our clinical services backlog is impacted by these pauses while 90% continues. Second, physical access to sites has been disrupted despite regulatory agencies around the world issuing guidance supporting the continuance of clinical trials while protecting patient safety. In our case, we've seen approximately 54% of site institutions impacted whether it be a suspension of CRA site visits or other site-related activities. About 70% of our clinical trial revenue is not related to site monitoring. Of the 30% tied to monitoring, we've been able to migrate more than half our work to a remote-based approach. We've also deployed several strategies to ensure patient participation can continue. Our logistics network allows us to ship supplies and medications directly to the patient where appropriate. In addition, we are using digital techniques to screen, monitor and enroll patients for some clinical trials. PPD is also looking beyond digital and virtual solutions and traditional sites to find other ways to help customers continue their clinical trials. As an example, within a matter of weeks, PPD designed and operationalized a program that allows the transfer of clinical trial patients from sites that have closed due to the pandemic to our network of 180 research sites, which have remained open and can rescue delayed clinical trials. In addition, several customers moved volume to our medical communications call center as smaller competitors were unable to maintain business continuity. Third, we have won a significant amount of fast burning COVID-19 work, which is helping to partially offset the impacts I've mentioned. Our teams are working tirelessly to launch and execute these studies. In several cases, working through the night to activate sites to allow dosing of critically ill patients the following day. New COVID-19 studies, coupled with the backlog of tasks from ongoing clinical trials, position us for a busy period as we enter recovery. While we have seen work resume with a quickening pace in countries like China, including site monitoring visits and new activations, we expect the recovery to be more gradual throughout the rest of the world. We are poised to accelerate trial delivery as soon as sites reopen. I believe the strength of our people managers and our industry-low turnover will enable us to continue high-quality execution throughout the pandemic and into recovery. Chris will discuss the financial impacts in his comments. Now turning to the Laboratory Services segment. Let me provide some context on how this business has been impacted. To minimize the pandemic impacts, the lab's leadership team mobilized quickly to establish clear safety protocols, implement split shifts, segregate departmental teams and move remote-capable employees home. These strategies, in addition to close coordination with state and local authorities, ensured our scientific staff have access to facilities to progress work in a safe and efficient manner. As a reminder, PPD Labs is comprised of a broad range of capabilities focused on drug development and organized into bioanalytical, GMP, vaccine and central labs. In order of magnitude, our GMP, BioA and vaccine lab together represents about 2/3 of our Laboratory business. Our GMP, BioA and vaccine labs are not reliant on sample volumes. Rather, the key drivers for these labs are staff availability and facility capacity. With respect to the central lab, we have seen disruption to sample volumes, but as sites reopen, we are seeing volumes recover. Lastly, PPD is one of the leading experts in infectious disease and vaccines, and this is underpinned by our 30-plus years of experience, which includes 15 FDA-approved vaccines and experience in over 300 infectious disease and vaccine trials. As a result, our labs are actively involved in a significant amount of COVID-19 work, which we expect to increase going forward. While the pandemic has no doubt presented challenges, our operations remain strong, our leaders and employees are adapting and we have and will find ways to ensure colleague and patient safety. I'll now turn it over to Chris Scully, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results. Yes. Tycho, this is Bill. As David mentioned, China is a comparator, but we're not sure it's the best comparator because activity has accelerated faster than we thought it would and forecasted it would. We've seen project initiations increase, IRB approvals increase, contract negotiations increase, site initiation visits increase, enrollments increasing, site audits are increasing. And based on our data and survey data we've seen suggests that they're back and sort of have recovered about 60%. Don't \u2013 as David said, don't expect the same necessary trajectory in Europe and in the U.S., but we are prepared. So from a resourcing perspective, we're in really good shape. So our site network, look, we think this is a good asset to have in our mix of services, and it can be used as a rescue mechanism for delayed studies, and we're in those kinds of conversations with customers. It's true it does have a fixed cost base associated with it that needs to be covered, but that's clearly offset by its strategic value and its use by customers and its uniqueness. So it's early days, but we think this is a good asset and part of the solution to help delayed clinical trials. Yes. Maybe just to add some color to Chris' commentary. We've got a diverse set of laboratories. We think they are one, two or three in their respective niches. And we're a recognized leader in our labs. So your question was, is this lumpy? Well, we \u2013 in Q1, you can see our authorization results and Labs were certainly a big contributor to that, and we've had strong authorization growth. So look, we've added capacity, but we usually add capacity in a kind of a smart way. It's aligned with customer demand, but you have to build out enough capacity when you go the trouble and apply the CapEx to sustain you for a year or 2. So we certainly have enough capacity to grow, and we have a customer and market demand that suggests we're in a good space. We had an outstanding quarter in Q1, no doubt about it, but we feel good about our laboratory segment going forward. Yes, Dave, I couldn't comment on the infection rate in China overall. I'll leave that to international health authorities in China. All I can do is tell you what we've seen in our business. This is an interesting factoid and makes me really happy, but none of our employees in China contracted the virus so far, which is amazing. And reviewing with our team the progress that's being made, I'm just suggesting that we're seeing activity resume in China. The metrics in the month of, recently have suggested that there's an uptick in activity in China. So that's positive, and we're going to see what happens. But I couldn't really comment on the infection rate in that country or anything of that nature. Dave, this is Bill. I might answer it in this way. Look, personnel is the biggest cost in our business, right? And \u2013 given its nature, so utilization is key to us and we have a lot of capability here analytically and to control that. And to your point, given the current situation, there's a lot of tension between cost containment and the expected increase in demand. Look, we certainly slowed hiring. Our utilization is holding up pretty good. It's certainly not a target, as you would expect. And we have taken an approach of reallocating team members between projects and shifting team members between functions in some cases. And so overall, our priority is quality and ensuring that we can keep business continuity for customers and studies and patients. And so we're doing that through a variety of mechanisms, and we're poised as recovery occurs to take advantage of that. Now look, clearly, a lot of other drivers of cost, travel costs have gone way down, et cetera. David mentioned some activities in his commentary. And we've had employees who have voluntarily chosen to reduce their hours in the Choice program that David mentioned. So I mean, we have a lot of levers we're pulling on the cost side appropriately with the situation, but we are poised to recover. Yes, John, this is Bill. Our Phase I clinics are part of our early development services business, which is in clinical. And so it's a subset of that broad category defined as early development. Look, we \u2013 what we did as the situation was developing in March. We finished out ongoing studies that were near completion for clients. We took a look at the situation. We decided to shut down that clinic. We furloughed some of the employees, and we thought that was the right thing to do because we didn't want to domicile healthy normal patients based on all the guidance from international, national and our local health authorities. So I would \u2013 we looked at the marketplace. We saw about half of those providing those services, kept them open and some reduced capacity and about half closed. We are in the camp of closing because we thought that was the right thing to do. So that's a subset of our business. We have clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Austin, Texas and in Orlando, Florida. And we're in the process of planning for reopening, depending on how the virus progresses, but I would see us taking a phased approach where these open up at the end of Q2 for a small subset of studies, a whole bunch of new procedures put in place. And then through the course of Q3, ramp up and then be at full capacity in Q4. That's how we're sort of thinking of our Phase I clinics. There's a lot of detail around it, but our team has done an excellent job, and we think we've done the right thing as a company to protect both our staff and patients. Yes, John, this is Bill. So first of all, our site network has remained open, okay? Number one. Number two, ongoing clinical trials, many ongoing clinical trials have continued, albeit at a slower pace. And then some clinical trials have been put on hold by customers because they represented these at-risk patient populations that I mentioned earlier, immunocompromised patients or elderly patients. So it's a bit of a mixed bag there. The key thing is it has remained open, they are screening, recruiting and enrolling patients. And as I said, it's a rescue mechanism for ongoing clinical trials, and we're having discussions with customers around that right now. We put into place a couple of virtual solutions to help keep patients engaged and enrolled in those trials. Customers are very concerned about patients lost to follow-up. We've been able to maintain a lot of continuity there. So we have experienced some studies that are delayed to enrollment or paused on enrollment just because of the nature of those patients, but it's remained open, and many studies are continuing. So we think as recovery strengthens that our site network is going to be a great solution. And then those studies that are on pause are going to resume. No. I think you hit it. Yes. David, I think you framed it quite well. I think the challenges aren't technical in nature. It's going to be access to sites, right? So access is a challenge. Clearly, there's new procedures that will be in place that various countries, institutions, et cetera, will put into place. And we and you will have to react to that so that our CRAs are prepared and able to enter those sites. And then it's the nature of our business. It's core. But clearly, there's a lot of protocol amendments that have been put in place around clinical trials as we've added digital services, as we're in a rescue mode, opening up new sites, catching up on activities that are required to be done at the site. We've done a lot of this work in advance, as I've said, to the extent we can to start-up a new clinical trial. But that's our bread and butter, those protocol amendments. And like David said, from a resourcing perspective, we're planning for recovery and ready for recovery."

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of very strong results. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System continues to drive outstanding financial performance. Customer demand is strong. Our core business is performing very well, we're gaining market share and we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID-19. And finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $3.16 billion. And our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%. Adjusted EPS was $6.54 per share. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%. And we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted EPS to $25.13 per share. Building on the tremendous success that we had in 2020, I'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021. It's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gain. Let me now give you a color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance delivering growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year. In addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading goal in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. During the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we declined in the low single-digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year. During the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens during the quarter, and we grew in the high teens for the full year. During the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy, and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year. Throughout the year the team executed really well to support customers' testing needs. And in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Before I move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID-19 response related revenue. This was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production. Throughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies. I'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic. At the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well. Let me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know, developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. We made outstanding progress in 2021. Let me share a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar. It was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation. In 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work. In our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive single-use bioreactor. Available in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot scale studies through commercial production. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development. During the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. And during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceutical. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors. And in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets, and I'll highlight a few examples. To increase our capacity for single-use technology, we opened new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers. In South Korea, we continue to enhance our own capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers. These additional capabilities position us really well to support our customers' needs. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. We've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers. In 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short- and long-term customer demand. Highlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids and lab products capacity. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year. They enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value proposition. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we were very active, investing $24 billion in M&A and completing ten transactions to further strengthen our customer value proposition. This was highlighted by the addition of PPD, which we closed in December. We're super excited to have our PPD colleagues as part of the company and share their expertise as we work together to enhance innovation and productivity for our pharma and biotech customers. PPD is performing at a very high level. The business delivered great results in 2021 and is entering 2022 with outstanding momentum, significantly ahead of our original expectations at the time of the deal announcement. The customer feedback has been extremely positive and we're excited about the pipeline of opportunities that we're building. We're executing our proven integration methodology, which is a key element of our PPI Business System to create value for all of our stakeholders. We're well positioned to deliver year three cost synergies of $75 million and $50 million in operating income from revenue synergies. And we're on track to deliver $40 million in cost synergies in 2022. At the end of the year, we completed the acquisition of PeproTech, a leading provider of recombinant proteins, which is an excellent complement to our industry-leading biosciences business. In 2021, we also returned $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG priorities, I'm very proud that over the past year we significantly advanced our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our mission, to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant. Highlights this year include our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our earlier goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% across our operations by 2030. Enhancing the reporting and transparency through our expanded corporate social responsibility report and alignment of multiple ESG reporting frameworks. And we're actively engaging with our community. Our Foundation for Science reached more than 100,000 students globally through our STEM education programs. Our goal is to make a very positive impact in the communities in which we live and work. With that, I'd like to now review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're significantly raising both our revenue and earnings guidance. This increase is a result of both the strong performance of our core business and an increase in the assumption for COVID-19 testing-related revenue. We're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, which would result in 7% revenue growth over 2021. And we're increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43 per share. So to summarize our key takeaways from 2021; we executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver outstanding financial performance. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. Our exceptional performance in 2021 and momentum entering 2022, enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022, and we're incredibly well positioned for the future. Our proven growth strategy positions us to deliver long-term core organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an excellent quarter, capping off another outstanding year. For the full year 2021, we delivered 17% organic growth that included 14% organic base business growth and $9.2 billion of COVID-19 response revenue. We delivered 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and over $7 billion of free cash flow, all while significantly investing in our company to enable a really bright future. I'm very proud of what the team accomplished this year. These results are significantly ahead of our prior guidance. So let me walk you through the key elements of the beat. We delivered $2.1 billion more revenue than included in our prior guide. This included $1.5 billion higher COVID-19 response revenue, $375 million of revenue from the PPD acquisition and $200 million higher base business revenue. On our last earnings call, we derisked testing response revenue in our guidance. And we said that if for any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L, and that's exactly what we did in Q4. Let me turn to the base business. In Q4, we delivered 8% base business organic growth, which was 3 percentage points higher than assumed in the prior guide. This is very good performance, particularly given the four fewer selling days in the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our core business is on a great growth trajectory, and we continue to step up and meet our customers' testing needs. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate great pull-through on the very strong revenue performance in Q4, leading to excellent adjusted EPS performance. We delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter and $25.13 for the full year; this was $1.76 ahead of our prior guide. So a broad-based beat to round out an outstanding year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $25.13, up 28% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.17. And for the full year 2021, GAAP EPS was $19.46, up 22% versus the prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue increase included a 4% organic revenue decrease, a 6% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. And as I mentioned, the base business organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%. For the full year 2021, reported revenue increased 22%, this includes 17% organic growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange. The full year base business organic growth was 14%. And in 2021, we delivered $9.23 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, which includes $2 billion of vaccines and therapy support revenue. Turning to our performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior year as well as four fewer selling days in Q4 2021 versus the prior year quarter. For Q4, North America declined in the low teens. Europe grew high single digits. Asia Pacific and China grew in the high single digits. And rest of the world grew mid-single digits. For the full year, North America grew low double digits. Europe grew over 25%. Asia Pacific grew over 20%, including just under 20% growth in China. And rest of the world grew mid-teens. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, 380 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is 130 basis points higher than 2020. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enables to deliver strong volume leverage on the base business, and strong productivity. This was more than offset by the impact of lower testing response revenue and our ongoing strategic investments across our business to support our near- and long-term growth. For the full year, we drove positive volume leverage and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by our strategic investments. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.5%, 340 basis points lower than Q4 last year. And for the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 17.3% of revenue. And for the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.1% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $390 million in Q4. And for the full year, R&D expense was $1.4 billion, representing growth of 19% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $150 million, $16 million higher than Q4 last year, largely due to the PPD financing activities? Net interest expense for the full year was $493 million, an increase of $5 million from 2020. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $7 million, $8 million higher than Q4 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $38 million, which is $8 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.8%. This was 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, mainly due to the different levels of pretax profitability year-over-year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.6% or 30 basis points higher than 2020. Average diluted shares were 398 million in Q4, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. And for the full year, the average diluted shares were 397 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 was $9.5 billion, up 15% over the prior year. And free cash flow for the year was $7 billion after investing $2.5 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects strong returns we're generating in the short-term and the investments that we'll make for the long-term. During the year, we returned approximately $2.4 million of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends and we ended Q4 with $4.5 billion in cash. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $34.9 billion, up $13.2 billion sequentially from Q3, largely as a result of the financing activities related to the PPD acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.3 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, up 180 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. So I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, and let me start with a few framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 response revenue varies by segments that has been consistent throughout the year. We continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the response revenue in each segment that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And during Q4, we had four fewer selling days than the year-ago quarter. And finally, we recently renamed Laboratory Products segment to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. It's now Laboratory Products in Biopharma Services segment. And also going forward, we'll refer to PPD as our clinical research business within this segment. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in the segment decreased 5% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 28% and organic revenue increased 23%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.2%, down 490 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 50%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2020. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q4 and organic growth was 6%. Growth in this segment this quarter was driven by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 18% and organic revenue increased 17%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we saw favorable business mix and delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. That was partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 390 basis points versus 2020. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q4, reported revenue and organic revenue were both 26% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 6% and organic revenue increased 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 43% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 20.5%, down 590 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus 2020. Then finally, Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q4, reported revenue in this segment increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 5%. During Q4, we saw strong growth in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses and we recognized $375 million of revenue for PPD to clinical research business. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 21% and organic revenue increased 15%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 42% and adjusted operating margin was 11.5%, which is 210 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity by our PPI Business System and saw a favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2020. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. Before I get into the details, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about our definition of core business, which we introduced at our Investor Day last year and notably transitioned to it in 2022. Core includes our base business, the vaccines and therapies response revenue and the PPD acquisition. Given the scale of the PPD acquisition, our core organic growth calculation will include PPD on a full year basis, if we think that gives you the best view of how to look at the total company business and how it's performing. For full transparency, we'll also continue to provide total company organic growth when reporting our actual performance in 2022. So moving on to our guidance, as Marc mentioned we're significantly increasing our full year 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. We're raising our full year 2022 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43. This very strong raise reflects the excellent strength of the business and we continue to expect 8% core organic revenue growth in 2022. Let me now provide you with additional details on the updated guidance. Starting with revenue, where there are four elements driving the $1.5 billion raise. A $1 billion increase in the COVID-19 testing assumption, a $900 million increase for the core business, a $500 million decrease due to the change in FX rates, and $100 million increase to reflect the PeproTech acquisition, which closed just before the year-end. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance under a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $1.75 billion of testing revenue in 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level and should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in 2021, we'll flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook. In terms of the core revenue raise, $600 million relates to PPD and reflects the excellent strength of that business and to a lesser extent the recent GAAP changes around deferred revenue measurement for acquisitions. We now expect PPD, our new clinical research business to deliver $6.5 billion in revenue in full year 2022. This represents 8% organic growth on a full year basis on top of 30% growth it delivered in 2021. And the remaining $300 million of the core revenue raise is to reflect the strong finish to 2021 by the rest of the core business. Our core business is in great shape. It ended 2021 with even more scale and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect that it will grow 8% organically in 2022. So a very strong raise overall for our revenue guidance. And we will use our PPI Business System to generate strong pull-through on that revenue. And we now expect adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022, that's a 20 basis points higher than what we assumed in our prior guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS. Our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from $21.36 to $22.43, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. As I mentioned PPD is expected to deliver $6.5 billion of revenue and $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022. This acquisition is now expected to contribute $1.90 to adjusted EPS in the year. PeproTech is expected to deliver revenue of just over $100 million in 2022 and $0.05 of adjusted EPS. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $500 million in revenue or 1.3% and $0.31 from adjusted EPS. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13% in 2022. We now expect full year net interest cost to be approximately $490 million and other income to be $10 million. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks to be already completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 395 million and 396 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling. In terms of revenue dollars, the assumption in the guide is the revenue dollars are fairly linear for the year, with Q1 and Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. The derisked assumption for COVID-19 testing used in this guidance assumes that this revenue is very front-end loaded in the first half of the year, and then as an assumed endemic run rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. Organic growth of the core business is expected to be fairly consistent throughout the year. And then in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, this guidance assumes slightly more weighting towards the first half of the year than the phasing we had last year, with Q1 being about the same percentage of the full year as we had in 2021. To conclude, we delivered another outstanding year, and we're in great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you and good morning.\nMarc Casper: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to start with PPD and the higher \u2013 good morning, Marc. Wanted to start with PPD and the higher 2022 growth trajectory here. Can you provide some more color around just your confidence in the handoff from the COVID-related work last year to other projects? PPD has been one of the leaders in biotech. So was curious to get your thought if some of that confidence is driven by some of the large Phase 3 mRNA studies, which are getting kicked off?\nMarc Casper: So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research business, PPD has really had a really excellent 2021 with 30% growth. And it was broad-based strength across biotech, biopharma, all the very important therapy areas that they're focused on, including work in the support of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. As we look at the authorizations, we're very strong last year, which gives the business great momentum coming into 2022 and 2023. And we feel good to be able to grow that business in line with our core average of about 8% this year. So we feel very good about the outlook for the business.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then for both you and Stephen, a big area of focus has been inflation in the market. So was wondering what your assumption is for pricing for 2022? Where you able to capture that across the portfolio? And how is that translating to revenue and earnings growth for the year?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Jack, so we have been very active on using the pricing lever as part of our PPI Business System, and we have a great team that helps our businesses do that in a very appropriate way. And we've seen basically in the second half of 2021, and as we project forward to 2022, pricing around about 2 times the normal level given the inflationary environment we're facing. So that's in aggregate across the whole portfolio. It's different by different areas of the business, but that's the aggregate result, and we're offsetting the impact of inflation through that pricing activity.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, guys.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: We take our next question from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. Marc, maybe just on the guidance raise, that core $400 million raise or so. Can you just talk through; I guess the end markets that you're seeing where you're feeling incrementally better going into 2022 versus a few months ago at the Analyst Day and then obviously, the 3Q update as well? Just kind of curious the confidence level going into 2022, you guys obviously sound quite bullish for the year. But maybe if you can just talk through some of the upside levers as we go into this year?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Patrick, we really ended the year with really strong performance. And you see that in the 17% organic growth that we delivered for the full year. You see that in the very strong base business growth of 14%. And bookings in the fourth quarter was once again ahead of revenue. So we enter the year with very strong momentum. As we thought about the outlook for the year, obviously we were quite bullish with the 8% back in September with the Analyst Day. And the way that we thought about it was all of the additional revenue in the core; we're basically going to grow that. We're going to keep that and then grow that by 8% as well. And that's sort of what's implied in the guidance. So we feel very well positioned given what our outlook was in September, how the business finished the fourth quarter, the strength of the bookings, and therefore, 2022 should be another quite year for the company.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. And Patrick, that \u2013 the extra \u2013 days was pretty broad across the business when I think about the impact in Q4.\nPatrick Donnelly: Understood. Okay. And then maybe just one on the capital deployment side. Obviously, you guys have been very active, another $2 billion to start the year here on the share repo. You kind of talked about the $7 billion free cash flow for the year. Can you just talk about the pipeline of opportunities on the deal side? Again, PeproTech seems like a nice fit. How active we should expect you to be, again, leverage seasonable at 2.3 coming out. So maybe just talk about the pipeline and the expectations for the year there?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So if you reflect back on last year, right, very active year with 10 transactions, and the bolt-ons about $4 billion worth of transactions, $20 billion roughly for PPD. So actually a really nice year of bolt-on activity. And if this was any other quarter in the fourth quarter, we actually were talking about PeproTech quite a bit, right, in terms of classic bolt-on, great growth prospects, good technology that is already performing well and will flourish under our ownership and the strength of our Biosciences business. So that's kind of the look back, right? And it gives you a sense that there's plenty of opportunity. Our pipeline is busy, right? We have plenty of financial capacity. We'll be incredibly disciplined to make sure that it fits our strict criteria, it creates shareholder value and that it really is additive to the portfolio. But we're actively looking at a number of transactions, and we'll see how they play out. The return of capital is also an important part of our strategy. And as you noted, we deployed already $2 billion on buybacks in the beginning of the year and we're excited to be able to do that for our shareholders as well.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks Marc.\nMarc Casper: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan, please go ahead.\nDan Arias: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Marc, maybe just following up on Patrick's M&A question there. I'm just curious about whether or not you're actually seeing assets become more attractive these days given the market moves? I mean, we've all seen valuations in the public markets come in. So it feels tempting to say, yes, but I imagine that the management teams of these companies remember their stocks being a lot higher, not too long ago. And on the private side maybe sort of a similar thing relative to the last raise or something. So I guess the question is, are assets any more approachable than they used to be in reality or not really?\nMarc Casper: Yes. I think it's early to see that that changes increases the pool, if you will of potential actionable transactions, right? And because it takes a while for valuation expectations to really settle down. And obviously, the stock market has bounced around a bunch. So it's \u2013 I think it will take a while for expectations to change. Our pipeline is busy, right? And we are truly disciplined. And you've heard me say in the past, right, when valuations are more elevated, you're going to think about businesses that have a very favorable risk reward profile. So you don't have scenarios where the businesses that you acquire aren't creating shareholder value. And obviously, if you get in a period where valuations are more favorable from an M&A perspective, then that's going to open up the pool, right? But I don't think that happens in the first month or two of the year. I think it's more of a, we'll see how the year plays out.\nDan Arias: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe on the clinical channel, how would you describe the spending environment in the hospital landscape right now when it just comes to sort of non-COVID-related items as we start off the year? It seems like things were normalizing, but then we did get some hospital capacity constraints as Omicron surged. So just curious how you're seeing things trend and how spending priorities are looking in demand overall in the clinical segment?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So when I think about the core health care and diagnostics portion of the business, I look back at last year, we had solid growth in the \u2013 in that routine activity or Specialty Diagnostics. What I would say is its better than it's growing again, but there's still some level of noise in terms of volume disruption, right? So it's not at the consistent growth that you would have seen in 2018, 2019. You lose two or three weeks because of Omicron that has some minor effect. It's fully baked into our numbers, and it would be truly in the noise level for us in terms of what our outlook is. But you're not yet at sort of maximum diagnostic growth outside of COVID testing until you really have no capacity utilization in the hospitals.\nDan Arias: Got it. Okay. Thanks Marc.\nOperator: The next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hey good morning.\nMarc Casper: Good morning.\nDerik De Bruin: So, Marc I don't know if you can do this, but it's the question we're getting from investors. But if you look at that 25.4% operating margin guide for 2022, what's the \u2013 I guess, can you do \u2013 can you talk to the push and takes on contributions or \u2013 what's the FX headwind? What's the decrease from PPD? And just \u2013 and basically in COVID sort of walk through the basis on what's sort of like the underlying margin? I think we're getting a lot of questions on that as people sort of think about sort of like the future trajectory.\nMarc Casper: Let me give you the 80,000 foot and I will not bridge you and Stephen will. We increased our operating margin outlook from the Investor Day. Actually, I think at the Investor Day, we did a really nice job of explaining, you bring PPD in at a lower margin in year one and margins expand. We talked a little bit about how the COVID would unwind, but also actually the longer-term view. So, we're kind of in a way, so let's go to the endpoint in the next three-year model or four-year model. And so that you can take all of the COVID out and you see the growth in margins off of that level. So actually, I'm super excited to come here and actually, we've been able to increase it. But Stephen, maybe you might want to add a little bit more.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, in terms of the long-term model, we said margins are greater than 26%. And that's all incorporated in this guidance as we think about 2022 as the year in that three-year long-term model. So, we raised our guidance for revenue. PPD is part of that, which is kind of mid-teens margin. FX is slightly more of a hurt in terms of the change versus the prior guide. And then the higher testing and the higher core business growth is coming through the decent margin. So that's the kind of puts and takes that gets you the 20 basis point increase. And it's all in line. It's actually slightly higher than what included in that full year model that we gave out at the Investor Day.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. And Marc, your APAC and China business actually ended the year quite strong. Do you sort of like give us your current thoughts on sort of like how you see China moving forward in 2022 and 2023 and just your high-growth markets in general, just how things are tracking there? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Derik thanks for the question. So, we had very strong growth in APAC, about 20% for the year and China just below, I think, 19%. So, it's kind of in the same range. When I look at the outlook, China being the largest of the countries in that region, it represents about 8% of our total revenue despite context. We expect it to be and continue to be one of our fastest-growing end markets. Significant investment in pharma and biotech, biotech in particular, in the country. We're well positioned to continue to serve that very well. So, the team in China is bullish about the outlook. There are clearly geopolitical tensions and we'll. Navigate those appropriately. And so that's part of it. And so, we feel good about what the outlook is there. And then we've had really good strength beyond China, right? South Korea continues to perform at a really good level. We played very strong role in India, and that's expanding nicely. The region has been good for us, and I'm very proud of how the team has performed in Asia-Pacific and obviously around the world.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. And if I can sneak one more in. The academic and government number in Q4, was that four less selling days and people not being back in the lab, some COVID headwinds just sort of talking, if you can sort of talk about that number?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So obviously, for the year, with the low double-digit growth, very strong. We had low single-digit decline, as you said, in the fourth quarter. Really, it's the combination, as you said, four selling days less. We also had a very strong comparison in academic and government in the prior year period. So that's probably the other factor beyond any Omicron-type disruption. So, as I thought about it, there was not much to read into it in terms of what the activity level was, what customers are talking about, pipeline stuff seems fairly normal.\nStephen Williamson: And then Derik, just reflecting on the margin \u2013 Derik, just reflecting on your margin question, when I think about the additional guide in terms of revenue for testing, that's assumed to come through at the average for the pull-through of the rest of the company as well. So not a significantly high margin profile, so I guess is the [indiscernible].\nRafael Tejada: Thanks, Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: Great, helpful.\nOperator: We take our next question from Luke Sergott from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLuke Sergott : Hey guys, good morning. I think everybody right now is trying to figure out the industry's capacity to absorb the COVID vaccine roll off. And given you guys supply, also manufacture and then do the clinical side, your thoughts here would be really helpful. But really just trying to figure out what indications or technologies are you guys are looking at that can replace any of that roll off?\nMarc Casper: Luke thanks for the question. So, when I think about the demand profile and capacity expansions, obviously, there has been very significant demand across the industry for supporting all of the COVID therapy and vaccine activity. And the industry, obviously, utilization went up hugely, probably unsustainably high. So, some of the investments you're seeing within our own company and sure, across others, is to bring utilization rates back to normal, right. So, that's the first thing to remind. Within our own business, if I think about the investments, I think about the nature of the customer contracts, I think about who the customers are, what else they have in their pipelines, our ability to transition the COVID-related activity to other therapeutic areas is something that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to do that. You don't do it necessarily in one quarter, right. It takes a few quarters to get all of that smooth out. But we have good line of sight in terms of how to backfill when COVID demand is, God willing, less needed around the world, right, as we all hope that it's something that, at some point, wanes to a certain extent. So, our ability to do that, and you can think about a visualize right, sterile fill-finish activities, really all of the biologics that are used for any indication run through that capacity, right? So, we've added capacity and we're running flat out. And if there's less of a need longer term for vaccines, then you would see that capacity go to other critical areas. So that would be \u2013 you can visualize it that way. The capacity is truly generic to all of the indications out there.\nLuke Sergott : All right that's really helpful. And then lastly, as you guys look at that $1.75 billion on testing, Mesa appears to have had a really strong quarter. Can you just give us a sense of the number of customers there? I know it's such a small product line, but it's a key new platform for you. So, as you think about number of customers, placements and as the menu kind of expands there.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so you have two different things going on with our rapid diagnostic systems, our PCR, that we acquired early in 2021. You have the long-term menu expenditure beyond the respiratory panel and the COVID-19 test. That's a multiyear investment that really leverages the technology for the long term. And we're excited about that, right? When I think about \u2013 the second aspect of it is the role in COVID response, demand there has been very, very high. And while I could say the exact number of customers, you would see it in the pharmacies, is a natural application where it's been used, you see it in the doctor offices, as well as in number of back-to-life settings. I've been to meetings where that technology has been used to clear people to be able to attend the meeting and you get a result in 30 minutes. So, it's an exclusive technology to get a PCR result that quickly. So, I feel good about the acquisition, how the technology road map is developing and how it's performing.\nLuke Sergott : Great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. Stephen, maybe one on the guidance here. Good morning to you. On the guide here, 8% core, I guess, I heard you say in your core revenues was raised by $300 million, $400 million-ish. Shouldn't you core be 9%? Like it feels like it's improved versus your last guidance. Is that the right way to think about your core accelerating?\nStephen Williamson: So, Vijay, good morning. The raise is because of the scale of the business has gotten larger in 2021, and then we're growing that at 8% going forward in 2022. So, the growth rate is still the same as our prior guidance for core, which is a very strong 8%. But the base in which it's growing is actually larger because of the way that we finished in the end of 2021.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then one on margins in bioprocessing. Did your COVID testing margin assumptions change. I'm curious Marc on this DynaDrive single-use bioprocessing reactor. Do you expect any share shift in the industry? It looks like you guys are quite optimistic about this product. So, I'm curious if this is a share gain opportunity for Thermo?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Vijay in terms of the bioproduction activity. So, in that we say the word bioproduction, what we're meaning here is our cell culture media, our single-use technologies, our purification resins. That's part of a much bigger set of production activities for pharma and biotech, which includes pharma services and our bioscience reagents, some of those activities. I called out the DynaDrive specifically because today, when you think about a customer choice for most probably 70% to 75% of medicines and indications that are biologics, you can use single-use technology. That doesn't mean that that's the share that is used, which you can economically and the alternative is stainless steel. And that's a 2,000-liter scale. Our technology allows you to go to 5,000-liter scale. That effectively opens it up for almost all medicines could be made. And it's probably a couple of very high-volume ones want to do a stainless steel. Now how fast customers will ultimately adopt it? Will take some time. We've obviously adopted it in one of our biologics facilities. And we're super excited about the capability because the economics and the quality is fantastic. So, I think the technology is exquisite, and it's unique to us. So yes, I think it allows us to grow our share over time.\nStephen Williamson: Basically, it expands our served end market in effect.\nMarc Casper: Yes.\nVijay Kumar: Got you. And Stephen, sorry, did your COVID testing margin assumptions change versus the last guide?\nStephen Williamson: In terms of the 2022 version, no. There is an assumption that it's going to contribute \u2013 come in the contribution margin around about the company average.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thank you, guys.\nRafael Tejada: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Marc, just a quick just comment, just kick it off. I'm still unsure on Zach, what knowing [indiscernible] the last five means certainly gives me some hope. I just wanted to ask a question on the base biologics business, ex-COVID. I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks, but you may have discussed it. So how did that business grow in the quarter? Could you give some color on what the bookings trends were in the quarter? And kind of what's assumed implied in the 2022 growth for that business?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Dan, when I think about our biologics, our production activities, I think, it's probably good to put it into the macro context. Roughly $20 billion of our revenue today including PPD serves, pharma and biotech. About half of it is in the production part of the business, right? And in general, the production goes a little faster than the other activities we do in pharma and biotech. And when you look at the company's long-term 7% to 9% core organic growth outlook, pharma and biotech will be the fastest of the growing end markets are growing faster than that on average going forward. So, we entered the year, obviously with very strong momentum, right, with 25% growth in pharma and biotech for the full year, a very special year. And we're excited about the growth prospects we have this year with the 8% core growth.\nDan Brennan: Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, just on the diagnostic testing side, you guys are obviously tremendously successful with COVID testing. I'm just wondering if you can comment on all the PCR platforms that you've expanded globally. What's the strategy? And what's some of the revenue contribution as COVID flows to kind of monetize maybe some content on those boxes? Is there something baked in to the base business or just how do we think about that opportunity for Thermo?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Dan, one of the things that we get questions \u2013 your question we get periodically. So, we try to at least frame it a bit in Stephen's remarks, where we expect in an endemic phase of COVID, about $100 million a quarter, $400 million a year of molecular diagnostics revenue related to the increased installed base, supporting COVID testing, the increased sample prep installed base. So that's a rough number. We'll give it more precision when we're actually in the endemic phase, but that's the view. When that exactly happens, we just assume that that starts in Q3, but that's an assumption, just like all of our testing things. We'll update that as we see how the pandemic plays out.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Dan.\nStephen Williamson: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. So, our final question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in here. Marc, one question for you on the M&A pipeline. I know it came up earlier in the call as well. But just curious as to philosophically get your view on how do you think of growth assets, specifically if an asset is not sort of minor EPS accretive near term, is that still sort of something that you would look at over here? Or would you sort of prefer kind of like the more PPD flavor of M&A?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so it's a great question, right. The way we think about acquisitions is really along our criteria, right. We start with is it strengthen the company strategically? Would our customers value it? And ultimately, does it create shareholder value? We start with the return on invested capital, the internal rates of returns. Before we get into the EPS or any of that stuff, we just say, is this a good long-term investment, right? And if it is, then we'll look at the shorter-term financials and say, is that an acceptable risk reward to us to take the activity? So, as you know, if you think about the many deals we have done, we actually haven't focused on, is it accretive to our organic growth or we've actually just focused on, is it a really strategic fit that strengthens the company that will create shareholder value. And we have an incredible track record of accelerating the growth of the businesses we acquire, right? So that's the cool thing. And you've seen us where over the years, we bought businesses like Life Technologies that was growing slower than the company average. Obviously, it's been unbelievable in terms of how fast it's grown in terms of at scale. And we're excited about PeproTech, which is a higher growth business, and we're excited about the prospects around PPD. So, thank you for the question.\nMarc Casper: So, let me wrap up and thank everybody for participating. We're obviously pleased with how we performed in 2021. We're in a really great position to achieve another excellent year in 2022. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's call. This now concludes. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an excellent quarter, capping off another outstanding year. For the full year 2021, we delivered 17% organic growth that included 14% organic base business growth and $9.2 billion of COVID-19 response revenue. We delivered 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and over $7 billion of free cash flow, all while significantly investing in our company to enable a really bright future. I'm very proud of what the team accomplished this year. These results are significantly ahead of our prior guidance. So let me walk you through the key elements of the beat. We delivered $2.1 billion more revenue than included in our prior guide. This included $1.5 billion higher COVID-19 response revenue, $375 million of revenue from the PPD acquisition and $200 million higher base business revenue. On our last earnings call, we derisked testing response revenue in our guidance. And we said that if for any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L, and that's exactly what we did in Q4. Let me turn to the base business. In Q4, we delivered 8% base business organic growth, which was 3 percentage points higher than assumed in the prior guide. This is very good performance, particularly given the four fewer selling days in the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our core business is on a great growth trajectory, and we continue to step up and meet our customers' testing needs. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate great pull-through on the very strong revenue performance in Q4, leading to excellent adjusted EPS performance. We delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter and $25.13 for the full year; this was $1.76 ahead of our prior guide. So a broad-based beat to round out an outstanding year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $25.13, up 28% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.17. And for the full year 2021, GAAP EPS was $19.46, up 22% versus the prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue increase included a 4% organic revenue decrease, a 6% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. And as I mentioned, the base business organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%. For the full year 2021, reported revenue increased 22%, this includes 17% organic growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange. The full year base business organic growth was 14%. And in 2021, we delivered $9.23 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, which includes $2 billion of vaccines and therapy support revenue. Turning to our performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior year as well as four fewer selling days in Q4 2021 versus the prior year quarter. For Q4, North America declined in the low teens. Europe grew high single digits. Asia Pacific and China grew in the high single digits. And rest of the world grew mid-single digits. For the full year, North America grew low double digits. Europe grew over 25%. Asia Pacific grew over 20%, including just under 20% growth in China. And rest of the world grew mid-teens. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, 380 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is 130 basis points higher than 2020. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enables to deliver strong volume leverage on the base business, and strong productivity. This was more than offset by the impact of lower testing response revenue and our ongoing strategic investments across our business to support our near- and long-term growth. For the full year, we drove positive volume leverage and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by our strategic investments. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.5%, 340 basis points lower than Q4 last year. And for the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 17.3% of revenue. And for the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.1% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $390 million in Q4. And for the full year, R&D expense was $1.4 billion, representing growth of 19% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $150 million, $16 million higher than Q4 last year, largely due to the PPD financing activities? Net interest expense for the full year was $493 million, an increase of $5 million from 2020. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $7 million, $8 million higher than Q4 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $38 million, which is $8 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.8%. This was 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, mainly due to the different levels of pretax profitability year-over-year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.6% or 30 basis points higher than 2020. Average diluted shares were 398 million in Q4, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. And for the full year, the average diluted shares were 397 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 was $9.5 billion, up 15% over the prior year. And free cash flow for the year was $7 billion after investing $2.5 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects strong returns we're generating in the short-term and the investments that we'll make for the long-term. During the year, we returned approximately $2.4 million of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends and we ended Q4 with $4.5 billion in cash. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $34.9 billion, up $13.2 billion sequentially from Q3, largely as a result of the financing activities related to the PPD acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.3 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, up 180 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. So I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, and let me start with a few framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 response revenue varies by segments that has been consistent throughout the year. We continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the response revenue in each segment that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And during Q4, we had four fewer selling days than the year-ago quarter. And finally, we recently renamed Laboratory Products segment to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. It's now Laboratory Products in Biopharma Services segment. And also going forward, we'll refer to PPD as our clinical research business within this segment. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in the segment decreased 5% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 28% and organic revenue increased 23%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.2%, down 490 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 50%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2020. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q4 and organic growth was 6%. Growth in this segment this quarter was driven by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 18% and organic revenue increased 17%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we saw favorable business mix and delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. That was partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 390 basis points versus 2020. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q4, reported revenue and organic revenue were both 26% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 6% and organic revenue increased 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 43% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 20.5%, down 590 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus 2020. Then finally, Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q4, reported revenue in this segment increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 5%. During Q4, we saw strong growth in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses and we recognized $375 million of revenue for PPD to clinical research business. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 21% and organic revenue increased 15%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 42% and adjusted operating margin was 11.5%, which is 210 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity by our PPI Business System and saw a favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2020. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. Before I get into the details, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about our definition of core business, which we introduced at our Investor Day last year and notably transitioned to it in 2022. Core includes our base business, the vaccines and therapies response revenue and the PPD acquisition. Given the scale of the PPD acquisition, our core organic growth calculation will include PPD on a full year basis, if we think that gives you the best view of how to look at the total company business and how it's performing. For full transparency, we'll also continue to provide total company organic growth when reporting our actual performance in 2022. So moving on to our guidance, as Marc mentioned we're significantly increasing our full year 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. We're raising our full year 2022 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43. This very strong raise reflects the excellent strength of the business and we continue to expect 8% core organic revenue growth in 2022. Let me now provide you with additional details on the updated guidance. Starting with revenue, where there are four elements driving the $1.5 billion raise. A $1 billion increase in the COVID-19 testing assumption, a $900 million increase for the core business, a $500 million decrease due to the change in FX rates, and $100 million increase to reflect the PeproTech acquisition, which closed just before the year-end. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance under a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $1.75 billion of testing revenue in 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level and should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in 2021, we'll flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook. In terms of the core revenue raise, $600 million relates to PPD and reflects the excellent strength of that business and to a lesser extent the recent GAAP changes around deferred revenue measurement for acquisitions. We now expect PPD, our new clinical research business to deliver $6.5 billion in revenue in full year 2022. This represents 8% organic growth on a full year basis on top of 30% growth it delivered in 2021. And the remaining $300 million of the core revenue raise is to reflect the strong finish to 2021 by the rest of the core business. Our core business is in great shape. It ended 2021 with even more scale and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect that it will grow 8% organically in 2022. So a very strong raise overall for our revenue guidance. And we will use our PPI Business System to generate strong pull-through on that revenue. And we now expect adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022, that's a 20 basis points higher than what we assumed in our prior guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS. Our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from $21.36 to $22.43, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. As I mentioned PPD is expected to deliver $6.5 billion of revenue and $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022. This acquisition is now expected to contribute $1.90 to adjusted EPS in the year. PeproTech is expected to deliver revenue of just over $100 million in 2022 and $0.05 of adjusted EPS. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $500 million in revenue or 1.3% and $0.31 from adjusted EPS. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13% in 2022. We now expect full year net interest cost to be approximately $490 million and other income to be $10 million. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks to be already completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 395 million and 396 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling. In terms of revenue dollars, the assumption in the guide is the revenue dollars are fairly linear for the year, with Q1 and Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. The derisked assumption for COVID-19 testing used in this guidance assumes that this revenue is very front-end loaded in the first half of the year, and then as an assumed endemic run rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. Organic growth of the core business is expected to be fairly consistent throughout the year. And then in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, this guidance assumes slightly more weighting towards the first half of the year than the phasing we had last year, with Q1 being about the same percentage of the full year as we had in 2021. To conclude, we delivered another outstanding year, and we're in great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. So Jack, so we have been very active on using the pricing lever as part of our PPI Business System, and we have a great team that helps our businesses do that in a very appropriate way. And we've seen basically in the second half of 2021, and as we project forward to 2022, pricing around about 2 times the normal level given the inflationary environment we're facing. So that's in aggregate across the whole portfolio. It's different by different areas of the business, but that's the aggregate result, and we're offsetting the impact of inflation through that pricing activity. Yes. And Patrick, that \u2013 the extra \u2013 days was pretty broad across the business when I think about the impact in Q4. Yes. So, in terms of the long-term model, we said margins are greater than 26%. And that's all incorporated in this guidance as we think about 2022 as the year in that three-year long-term model. So, we raised our guidance for revenue. PPD is part of that, which is kind of mid-teens margin. FX is slightly more of a hurt in terms of the change versus the prior guide. And then the higher testing and the higher core business growth is coming through the decent margin. So that's the kind of puts and takes that gets you the 20 basis point increase. And it's all in line. It's actually slightly higher than what included in that full year model that we gave out at the Investor Day. And then Derik, just reflecting on the margin \u2013 Derik, just reflecting on your margin question, when I think about the additional guide in terms of revenue for testing, that's assumed to come through at the average for the pull-through of the rest of the company as well. So not a significantly high margin profile, so I guess is the [indiscernible]. So, Vijay, good morning. The raise is because of the scale of the business has gotten larger in 2021, and then we're growing that at 8% going forward in 2022. So, the growth rate is still the same as our prior guidance for core, which is a very strong 8%. But the base in which it's growing is actually larger because of the way that we finished in the end of 2021. Basically, it expands our served end market in effect. In terms of the 2022 version, no. There is an assumption that it's going to contribute \u2013 come in the contribution margin around about the company average. Thank you, Dan."

            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of very strong results. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System continues to drive outstanding financial performance. Customer demand is strong. Our core business is performing very well, we're gaining market share and we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID-19. And finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $3.16 billion. And our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%. Adjusted EPS was $6.54 per share. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%. And we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted EPS to $25.13 per share. Building on the tremendous success that we had in 2020, I'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021. It's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gain. Let me now give you a color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance delivering growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year. In addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading goal in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. During the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we declined in the low single-digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year. During the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens during the quarter, and we grew in the high teens for the full year. During the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy, and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year. Throughout the year the team executed really well to support customers' testing needs. And in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Before I move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID-19 response related revenue. This was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production. Throughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies. I'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic. At the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well. Let me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know, developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. We made outstanding progress in 2021. Let me share a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar. It was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation. In 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work. In our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive single-use bioreactor. Available in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot scale studies through commercial production. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development. During the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. And during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceutical. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors. And in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets, and I'll highlight a few examples. To increase our capacity for single-use technology, we opened new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers. In South Korea, we continue to enhance our own capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers. These additional capabilities position us really well to support our customers' needs. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. We've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers. In 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short- and long-term customer demand. Highlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids and lab products capacity. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year. They enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value proposition. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we were very active, investing $24 billion in M&A and completing ten transactions to further strengthen our customer value proposition. This was highlighted by the addition of PPD, which we closed in December. We're super excited to have our PPD colleagues as part of the company and share their expertise as we work together to enhance innovation and productivity for our pharma and biotech customers. PPD is performing at a very high level. The business delivered great results in 2021 and is entering 2022 with outstanding momentum, significantly ahead of our original expectations at the time of the deal announcement. The customer feedback has been extremely positive and we're excited about the pipeline of opportunities that we're building. We're executing our proven integration methodology, which is a key element of our PPI Business System to create value for all of our stakeholders. We're well positioned to deliver year three cost synergies of $75 million and $50 million in operating income from revenue synergies. And we're on track to deliver $40 million in cost synergies in 2022. At the end of the year, we completed the acquisition of PeproTech, a leading provider of recombinant proteins, which is an excellent complement to our industry-leading biosciences business. In 2021, we also returned $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG priorities, I'm very proud that over the past year we significantly advanced our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our mission, to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant. Highlights this year include our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our earlier goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% across our operations by 2030. Enhancing the reporting and transparency through our expanded corporate social responsibility report and alignment of multiple ESG reporting frameworks. And we're actively engaging with our community. Our Foundation for Science reached more than 100,000 students globally through our STEM education programs. Our goal is to make a very positive impact in the communities in which we live and work. With that, I'd like to now review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're significantly raising both our revenue and earnings guidance. This increase is a result of both the strong performance of our core business and an increase in the assumption for COVID-19 testing-related revenue. We're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, which would result in 7% revenue growth over 2021. And we're increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43 per share. So to summarize our key takeaways from 2021; we executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver outstanding financial performance. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. Our exceptional performance in 2021 and momentum entering 2022, enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022, and we're incredibly well positioned for the future. Our proven growth strategy positions us to deliver long-term core organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Good morning, Jack. So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research business, PPD has really had a really excellent 2021 with 30% growth. And it was broad-based strength across biotech, biopharma, all the very important therapy areas that they're focused on, including work in the support of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. As we look at the authorizations, we're very strong last year, which gives the business great momentum coming into 2022 and 2023. And we feel good to be able to grow that business in line with our core average of about 8% this year. So we feel very good about the outlook for the business. Thanks Jack. Yes. So Patrick, we really ended the year with really strong performance. And you see that in the 17% organic growth that we delivered for the full year. You see that in the very strong base business growth of 14%. And bookings in the fourth quarter was once again ahead of revenue. So we enter the year with very strong momentum. As we thought about the outlook for the year, obviously we were quite bullish with the 8% back in September with the Analyst Day. And the way that we thought about it was all of the additional revenue in the core; we're basically going to grow that. We're going to keep that and then grow that by 8% as well. And that's sort of what's implied in the guidance. So we feel very well positioned given what our outlook was in September, how the business finished the fourth quarter, the strength of the bookings, and therefore, 2022 should be another quite year for the company. Yes. So if you reflect back on last year, right, very active year with 10 transactions, and the bolt-ons about $4 billion worth of transactions, $20 billion roughly for PPD. So actually a really nice year of bolt-on activity. And if this was any other quarter in the fourth quarter, we actually were talking about PeproTech quite a bit, right, in terms of classic bolt-on, great growth prospects, good technology that is already performing well and will flourish under our ownership and the strength of our Biosciences business. So that's kind of the look back, right? And it gives you a sense that there's plenty of opportunity. Our pipeline is busy, right? We have plenty of financial capacity. We'll be incredibly disciplined to make sure that it fits our strict criteria, it creates shareholder value and that it really is additive to the portfolio. But we're actively looking at a number of transactions, and we'll see how they play out. The return of capital is also an important part of our strategy. And as you noted, we deployed already $2 billion on buybacks in the beginning of the year and we're excited to be able to do that for our shareholders as well. You are welcome. Yes. I think it's early to see that that changes increases the pool, if you will of potential actionable transactions, right? And because it takes a while for valuation expectations to really settle down. And obviously, the stock market has bounced around a bunch. So it's \u2013 I think it will take a while for expectations to change. Our pipeline is busy, right? And we are truly disciplined. And you've heard me say in the past, right, when valuations are more elevated, you're going to think about businesses that have a very favorable risk reward profile. So you don't have scenarios where the businesses that you acquire aren't creating shareholder value. And obviously, if you get in a period where valuations are more favorable from an M&A perspective, then that's going to open up the pool, right? But I don't think that happens in the first month or two of the year. I think it's more of a, we'll see how the year plays out. Yes. So when I think about the core health care and diagnostics portion of the business, I look back at last year, we had solid growth in the \u2013 in that routine activity or Specialty Diagnostics. What I would say is its better than it's growing again, but there's still some level of noise in terms of volume disruption, right? So it's not at the consistent growth that you would have seen in 2018, 2019. You lose two or three weeks because of Omicron that has some minor effect. It's fully baked into our numbers, and it would be truly in the noise level for us in terms of what our outlook is. But you're not yet at sort of maximum diagnostic growth outside of COVID testing until you really have no capacity utilization in the hospitals. Good morning. Let me give you the 80,000 foot and I will not bridge you and Stephen will. We increased our operating margin outlook from the Investor Day. Actually, I think at the Investor Day, we did a really nice job of explaining, you bring PPD in at a lower margin in year one and margins expand. We talked a little bit about how the COVID would unwind, but also actually the longer-term view. So, we're kind of in a way, so let's go to the endpoint in the next three-year model or four-year model. And so that you can take all of the COVID out and you see the growth in margins off of that level. So actually, I'm super excited to come here and actually, we've been able to increase it. But Stephen, maybe you might want to add a little bit more. Yes. So, Derik thanks for the question. So, we had very strong growth in APAC, about 20% for the year and China just below, I think, 19%. So, it's kind of in the same range. When I look at the outlook, China being the largest of the countries in that region, it represents about 8% of our total revenue despite context. We expect it to be and continue to be one of our fastest-growing end markets. Significant investment in pharma and biotech, biotech in particular, in the country. We're well positioned to continue to serve that very well. So, the team in China is bullish about the outlook. There are clearly geopolitical tensions and we'll. Navigate those appropriately. And so that's part of it. And so, we feel good about what the outlook is there. And then we've had really good strength beyond China, right? South Korea continues to perform at a really good level. We played very strong role in India, and that's expanding nicely. The region has been good for us, and I'm very proud of how the team has performed in Asia-Pacific and obviously around the world. Yes. So obviously, for the year, with the low double-digit growth, very strong. We had low single-digit decline, as you said, in the fourth quarter. Really, it's the combination, as you said, four selling days less. We also had a very strong comparison in academic and government in the prior year period. So that's probably the other factor beyond any Omicron-type disruption. So, as I thought about it, there was not much to read into it in terms of what the activity level was, what customers are talking about, pipeline stuff seems fairly normal. Luke thanks for the question. So, when I think about the demand profile and capacity expansions, obviously, there has been very significant demand across the industry for supporting all of the COVID therapy and vaccine activity. And the industry, obviously, utilization went up hugely, probably unsustainably high. So, some of the investments you're seeing within our own company and sure, across others, is to bring utilization rates back to normal, right. So, that's the first thing to remind. Within our own business, if I think about the investments, I think about the nature of the customer contracts, I think about who the customers are, what else they have in their pipelines, our ability to transition the COVID-related activity to other therapeutic areas is something that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to do that. You don't do it necessarily in one quarter, right. It takes a few quarters to get all of that smooth out. But we have good line of sight in terms of how to backfill when COVID demand is, God willing, less needed around the world, right, as we all hope that it's something that, at some point, wanes to a certain extent. So, our ability to do that, and you can think about a visualize right, sterile fill-finish activities, really all of the biologics that are used for any indication run through that capacity, right? So, we've added capacity and we're running flat out. And if there's less of a need longer term for vaccines, then you would see that capacity go to other critical areas. So that would be \u2013 you can visualize it that way. The capacity is truly generic to all of the indications out there. Yes, so you have two different things going on with our rapid diagnostic systems, our PCR, that we acquired early in 2021. You have the long-term menu expenditure beyond the respiratory panel and the COVID-19 test. That's a multiyear investment that really leverages the technology for the long term. And we're excited about that, right? When I think about \u2013 the second aspect of it is the role in COVID response, demand there has been very, very high. And while I could say the exact number of customers, you would see it in the pharmacies, is a natural application where it's been used, you see it in the doctor offices, as well as in number of back-to-life settings. I've been to meetings where that technology has been used to clear people to be able to attend the meeting and you get a result in 30 minutes. So, it's an exclusive technology to get a PCR result that quickly. So, I feel good about the acquisition, how the technology road map is developing and how it's performing. Yes. So, Vijay in terms of the bioproduction activity. So, in that we say the word bioproduction, what we're meaning here is our cell culture media, our single-use technologies, our purification resins. That's part of a much bigger set of production activities for pharma and biotech, which includes pharma services and our bioscience reagents, some of those activities. I called out the DynaDrive specifically because today, when you think about a customer choice for most probably 70% to 75% of medicines and indications that are biologics, you can use single-use technology. That doesn't mean that that's the share that is used, which you can economically and the alternative is stainless steel. And that's a 2,000-liter scale. Our technology allows you to go to 5,000-liter scale. That effectively opens it up for almost all medicines could be made. And it's probably a couple of very high-volume ones want to do a stainless steel. Now how fast customers will ultimately adopt it? Will take some time. We've obviously adopted it in one of our biologics facilities. And we're super excited about the capability because the economics and the quality is fantastic. So, I think the technology is exquisite, and it's unique to us. So yes, I think it allows us to grow our share over time. Yes. Yes. So, Dan, when I think about our biologics, our production activities, I think, it's probably good to put it into the macro context. Roughly $20 billion of our revenue today including PPD serves, pharma and biotech. About half of it is in the production part of the business, right? And in general, the production goes a little faster than the other activities we do in pharma and biotech. And when you look at the company's long-term 7% to 9% core organic growth outlook, pharma and biotech will be the fastest of the growing end markets are growing faster than that on average going forward. So, we entered the year, obviously with very strong momentum, right, with 25% growth in pharma and biotech for the full year, a very special year. And we're excited about the growth prospects we have this year with the 8% core growth. Yes. So, Dan, one of the things that we get questions \u2013 your question we get periodically. So, we try to at least frame it a bit in Stephen's remarks, where we expect in an endemic phase of COVID, about $100 million a quarter, $400 million a year of molecular diagnostics revenue related to the increased installed base, supporting COVID testing, the increased sample prep installed base. So that's a rough number. We'll give it more precision when we're actually in the endemic phase, but that's the view. When that exactly happens, we just assume that that starts in Q3, but that's an assumption, just like all of our testing things. We'll update that as we see how the pandemic plays out. Thanks Dan. Yes, so it's a great question, right. The way we think about acquisitions is really along our criteria, right. We start with is it strengthen the company strategically? Would our customers value it? And ultimately, does it create shareholder value? We start with the return on invested capital, the internal rates of returns. Before we get into the EPS or any of that stuff, we just say, is this a good long-term investment, right? And if it is, then we'll look at the shorter-term financials and say, is that an acceptable risk reward to us to take the activity? So, as you know, if you think about the many deals we have done, we actually haven't focused on, is it accretive to our organic growth or we've actually just focused on, is it a really strategic fit that strengthens the company that will create shareholder value. And we have an incredible track record of accelerating the growth of the businesses we acquire, right? So that's the cool thing. And you've seen us where over the years, we bought businesses like Life Technologies that was growing slower than the company average. Obviously, it's been unbelievable in terms of how fast it's grown in terms of at scale. And we're excited about PeproTech, which is a higher growth business, and we're excited about the prospects around PPD. So, thank you for the question. So, let me wrap up and thank everybody for participating. We're obviously pleased with how we performed in 2021. We're in a really great position to achieve another excellent year in 2022. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone."

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Raf. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Third Quarter call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, achieving exceptional financial performance while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. As I reflect on the year so far, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is driving outstanding financial performance. Our base business is performing very well and we're playing a leading role in our industry's response to COVID-19. And we continue to build on our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our unique customer value proposition.  All of this gives me great confidence and a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, I will get into more detail on these in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q3 increased to $9.33 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $2.78 billion and our adjusted operating margin was 29.8% for the quarter. Finally, we increased adjusted EPS by 2% - $5.76 per share.  So another outstanding quarter. Turning to our end markets in Q3, market conditions were strong and our team executed well to deliver another fantastic quarter. Starting with Pharma and Biotech, we continue to have outstanding performance in this end market with growth of just over 20% driven once again by strong market dynamics, our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  Our trusted partner status earned over many years with these customers continues to drive robust growth. In this end market, we saw a broad-based strength, including in our bioproduction, pharma services, Biosciences, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as in the Research and Safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the mid-single-digits in the quarter with very good growth in Biosciences, and the Research and Safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens. In Q3, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in the Research and Safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined 11%. Performance in our base business was strong, driven by immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostics.  The team also executed very well to support customers COVID-19 testing needs, delivering $1.55 billion of revenue this quarter versus $1.8 billion in Q3 last year. Before I move on to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our industry-leading role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.05 billion in COVID-19 response-related revenue. With the surge in the Delta variant, we saw a strong testing demand around the world in Q3. We also played a very meaningful role in vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 generating just over $500 million in the quarter from these activities.  The underlying demand for our product and service offerings used in the production and development of vaccines is very robust and over time, we expect this demand to transition to non-COVID revenue. Our industry-leading response to the pandemic has enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy, strengthen customer relationships, and accelerate investments, which contributed to our ability to raise our long-term core organic growth guidance to 7% to 9% as we communicated at our recent Investor Day. Let me now give you an update on our growth strategy, which consists of three elements. Continuously developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale on the high-growth in emerging markets and delivering unique value proposition to our customers. Let me provide a few examples of how we're delivering on our growth strategy.  Starting with innovation, we launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and make the world a better place. In our genetic sciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems Quantz Studio Absolute Q Digital PCR system. This is the first fully integrated Digital PCR system featuring simplified workflows and designed to provide highly accurate results in only 90 minutes.  This system will help events our customers innovation efforts in areas like oncology and cell and gene therapy. And chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched three new Thermo Fisher Scientific TSQ plus triple quadruple mass spectrometers to address the growing need for faster throughput and increased sensitivity across a range of applications in Biopharma and applied science, including clinical research for large and small molecules, toxicology from Safety and environmental analysis. We also launched the Thermal Scientific Vanquish NEO UHPLC system and the Thermo Scientific Tech map Neo, UHPLC columns designed for use in proteomics precision medicine, and translational research.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers and high-growth in emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent performance we are delivering across Asia-Pacific, where we delivered growth in the low double-digits during the quarter. We continue to build our presence and capabilities in the region. During the quarter, we opened a bioprocess design center in South Korea. This facility features laboratory and educational space and more than 100 instruments that support pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes. This center will help our pharm and biotech customers advance their important work.  Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. As I mentioned last quarter, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in Capex this year. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. Building our pharma services capabilities in Q3, we brought on additional capacity online to support vaccine and therapy production.  As part of the previously announced strategic partnership with CSL limited, we assumed operating responsibility for our new state-of-the-art biologics site and like now in [Indiscernible] The site will feature highly flexible bioproduction technologies, including single-use and stainless steel to provide a pathway from development to large-scale production as customers needs evolve. To support growing demand in the biopharmaceutical industry, we announced plans to open a new bioproduction facility in Nashville, Tennessee to manufacturer single-use technologies. The facility will be one of our largest SUT sites in the world. In addition to support disease research and diagnostic testing, we announced our commitment to co-invest with the U.S. government in building a state-of-the-art facility to manufacturer pipette tips.  The new facility will be located in North Carolina and designed in line with Thermo Fisher Scientific's carbon neutrality goals. These investments are value proposition, demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in [indiscernible]. Now, let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we are super excited for acquisition of PPD. The business is performing well.  The regulatory process is on track, and we expect to close by year-end. As a reminder, PPD will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and yet highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. Integration planning is going very well. Financing is largely complete, and we're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher later this year. Before turning to our guidance, let me update you on our progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in [Indiscernible] science, we know we have a responsibility to use our industry leadership position to make the world a better place.  And to that end, we continue to advance our sustainability and social impact initiatives. During the quarter we committed to expand our use of ACT product labeling to include our entire cold storage portfolio by the end of the year. ACT labeling clearly details environmental impact of the product, empowering our customers to make sustainable choices and ultimately helping them achieve their own goals for environmental stewardship. Our 90,000 colleagues are also passionate about the difference they can make. And our local site-based community action counsels support a number of charitable and stem education activities throughout the year. We have amplified our -- supporting these efforts by investing in additional $15 million in our foundation for science.  And we continue to support the historically black colleges and universities to deliver accurate COVID-19 testing to students and staff, helping to ensure campus safety and the ability to confidently deliver in-person learning. With that, I'd like to review our guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This increase is a result of our strong Q3 operational performance in our base business. And the continued strength of our COVID-19 response revenue.  We're raising our revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, which would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by a $1.30 to $23.37 per share, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. The 2022 guidance raise reflects the increased Outlook for the core business and adds to the very strong Outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day. We're raising our 2022 full-year revenue guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion, and increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. To summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we executed very well to continue our growth momentum, and deliver excellent revenue in earnings performance. Our business is performing very well and we continue to play a leading role in the pandemic response.  We continue to expand our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanding capabilities to further enhance our customer value proposition. And our exceptional performance through the third quarter enabled us to raise our outlook for the year and sets us up for an even brighter future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen.\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc. And good morning everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base business and the vaccines and therapies response revenue, and of course core will also include the PPD acquisition. So moving on to the details in Q3, it was another excellent quarter.  Let me provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. Yet the broad-based beat versus the prior guide. Revenue was $1.2 billion higher, driven by $900 million higher testing response revenue, $250 million higher core business revenue, and $50 million more favorable core-FX. On our last earnings call, our guidance de-risk testing response revenue and we said that if there were any additional opportunities to support customer's testing needs, we'd be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L.  That's exactly what we did in Q3, in total delivering $1.55 billion of testing response revenue in the quarter. We also had a great strength in the core business. In Q3, the base business organic growth was 10%, which is 3%, or $190 million higher than included in our prior guide. Also in the core, vaccines and therapies response revenue was $60 million higher than in that prior guide, and worth $510 million for the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top-line. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top-line performance. And at the same time, execute really well on that significant growth investments.  And as a result, adjusted BPS in Q3 was a $1.30 higher than included in our prior guide. And the the components that's over achievement or a dollar from testing response revenue, $0.20 from the core business, and $0.10 from FX on the base business. Overall, another excellent quarter. Let me now provide some color on the Q3 performance. Beginning with our Q3 earnings results, as you saw on our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to GAAP EPS in the quarter with $4.79 down 1% from Q3 last year. On the top-line our Q3, reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 7% organic growth, a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange, and 1% contribution from acquisitions.  As I mentioned, the base business organic growth in the quarter was 10%. Change by our performance by geography during the quarter, North America was flat. Europe grew over 20% Asia-Pacific grew low double-digits. China grew in the low single-digits and rest of the world decline in the high single-digits. The organic growth rate by geo are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior quarters, as well as the scale of the impact of the pandemic on the base business in the prior year. Since our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, 310 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver strong productivity, which has more than offset by unfavorable business mix, and the ongoing strategic investments across that businesses.  Including investments in our colleagues, all of these are being made to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 51.4%, 90 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The decrease in gross margin had similar drivers to those I've just mentioned for adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, an increase of 190 basis points versus Q3 of 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million representing growth of 19% versus Q3 2020. It reflects our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense with a $190 million $17 million lower than Q3 last year, largely due to lower average interest rate on our debt.  Adjusted other income expense with net income in the quarter of $9 million, $7 million pile in Q3 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating effect. But the tax rate in the quarter was 14.2%. Down a 150 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were 397 million in Q3, 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet, cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System continued to be very strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, up 27% from the same period last year. And that's after investing $1.7 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short-term and investments we're making for the long-term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects some 18% dividend increase announced in February. And during the quarter we issued $3.1 billion in new debt as part of the prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. We ended Q3 with $12 billion in cash and $21.7 billion was the total debt. And leverage ratio at the end the quarter with 1.6 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.7 times on a Net debt basis.  Concluding my comments on total Company performance adjusted ROIC was 22.3%, up 740 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate exceptional returns. Now provide some color on the performance for that full business segments. Similar to last quarter's, I'll start with some spring thoughts on the impact of COVID-19 response in that segments. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the past quarters, the majority of our COVID-19 response revenue was recognized in life sciences solutions. With the remainder recognizing the public products and services, especially diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses.  Besides, those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in these segments. That does skew some of the reported in the segment margin. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q3 reported revenue in this segment increased 9%, an organic growth was 4%. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, down 600 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a positive volume leverage, which is more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q3, and organic growth with 9%.  Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by the electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 54%, and adjusted margin was 17.8%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which is partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across those segments. In respect to the diagnostics in Q3, reported revenue decreased by 5% and the segment declined organically by 5%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostic businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, down 520 basis points from the prior year. In Q3, in drug positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System, this was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the quarter. Finally, in the [Indiscernible] products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 12%, organic growth was 10%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 11%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove good volume pull-through, and productivity by our PPI Business System, which was more than offset by strategic investments.  With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're increasing full-year guidance for both 2021 and 2021. For 2021, we're banking the Q3 beat and maintaining our prior guidance assumptions for Q4. Then for 2022, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies beat from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers. This is enabling a strong beat and raise for both years reflecting the continued excellent strength of the business. I will now provide you with more detailed starting with 2021. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 21 guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, an d increasing our full-year organic growth outlook from 9% to 12%.  That includes an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full-year from 12% to 13% and an increase in the COVID-19 response revenue for the year from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, which represents $5.8 billion of testing response revenue, and $1.9 billion of vaccines and therapies response revenue. As I mentioned previously, there are no changes in the revenue assumptions in Q4 and our revised 2021 guidance. We're continuing the same de-risked approach to guidance for COVID-19 testing response revenue, and continue to assume $450 million of testing-related revenue in Q4.  There continue to be a range of outcomes we're tapping in the fourth quarter and for 2022. There's scenarios where testing demand could be higher than that included in our guidance. Should that be the case, we will be well-positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in Q3, we will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a direct approach to the Outlook. And as a reminder, there are four fewer selling days in Q4 '21, compared to the same period last year. Incorporating our very strong Q3 performance into the revised '21 guidance, we now expect that adjusted operating margins for the full-year will be approximately 30.4%, 70 basis points higher than both our prior guide, and 2020.  Then same to the adjusted EPS, by banking the Q3 beat, we are raising our full-year '21 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would result in 20% growth over 2020. The revised guidance seems an adjusted income tax rate of 14.3% in 2021, slightly higher than the prior guide to reflect the marginal tax rate on our increased profitability. The rest of the assumptions underlying that 2021 guidance remains the same. And to call out a few of those, we've not included any operational benefit in 2021 for the acquisition of PPD, which is assumed to close at the end of the year.  We expect full-year net interest costs to be approximately $510 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion a share buybacks, $1.4 billion per completed M&A, and $400 million of the capital return to shareholders through dividends. Let me estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. Now, moving on to the 2020 guidance rates. As I mentioned, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies peak from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers.  In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion. That reflects a $250 million increase in core revenue, offset positive by $50 million less FX tailwind for the year. The guidance for 2022 continues to see in core organic growth of 8% and $750 million of testing response revenue for the year. In terms of the adjusted EPS, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. As Marc mentioned, the 2022 guidance increase reflects the increased strength of our core business, adding to the already very strong outlook for 2022. As I shared with you at the recent Investor Day. So to conclude, we're delivering another ex -- we delivered another excellent quarter and are in great position to achieve both our '21 and 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q& A roster. In order to allow everyone in queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management team, please limit your time on the call to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Marc maybe one for you just on the guidance. Obviously encouraging to see you raise the '22 guidance going to flow-through the beat so soon after providing at the Analyst Day. Can you just talk about not bumping the 4Q number? Obviously, again, the core seemed a bit stronger in 3Q, the end-market recovery seems well on its way. I certainly understand keeping the testing conservative. But maybe just on the core business, what kept you guys from flowing through a bit of that strength into 4Q?\nMarc Casper: Patrick, thanks for the question. Good morning. Obviously, really outstanding Q3. When I think about the momentum in the core business in the fourth quarter, we obviously enter the fourth quarter with very strong performance. As I look at the outlook for Q4, first, we felt it was prudent to keep it at the same that we did last quarter. There's nothing particularly deep about that. We have -- or less selling days. So when you look at the base business results, it's very similar. It implies about 9% growth, about 5% reported, and about 4 points for the day. You see here about 9% growth. So very similar to what you saw in Q3. And when you look at the other part of core, which is the vaccine and therapy numbers, similar levels of revenue to what you saw in Q3 there. So we felt that was a prudent view.  On the testing response, we kept the de-risk number. We're obviously going to shift whatever our customers need and if you think about how short the true visibility is for testing response, which is we de-risk ed at the end of July. And by the time we got into August, the Delta variant had creating huge demand for testing. So we feel that the 450 number is one that we have incredibly high likelihood of achieving and we'll obviously shift, meaning it could work. And that other customers need it. So that's how we've thought about. And for -- as we talked about 2022, we carried forward the core revenue beat into the year. And as we sit here at the end of January, when we give our full year, our final guidance for the year we'll look at what is the right level of assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful. Makes sense. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on China. Low single-digit growth that you got a lot of noise in the region there between the tender process, general macro headlines. Can you just expand a bit on what you guys are seeing there? Again, it's always hard to remove a little bit of the comp noise and COVID noise. So would love just your thoughts on China and what you're expecting on the go forward.\nMarc Casper: I think given the way your offset by over their questions for us explains what's going on, which is we had low single-digit growth. In the year-ago period, we had an incredibly strong COVID response revenue in China. So that drives there. When I look at bookings which gives you a sense of new orders, that grew about 10% in the quarter. So that activity was good. We have a strong backlog there and reviewing what's going on with our local team. No. Conditions actually continue to be good and the government's focused on some of the initiatives that will drive strong long-term growth. Focus on Biotech industry and food safety, those kinds of things. So I think China ultimately continues to be a nice, strong growth market for the Company going forward.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you, Marc.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good morning. Marc, first question on supply-chain. I don't think anybody can -- it's a huge risk for you guys. You obviously can handle these things well, but maybe just give us some color on what's going on in the ground, like are you able to pass on higher resin costs? Are there component shortages in do you have to work down inventory? Just curious on some of the gives and takes around supply chain for you that's right now.\nMarc Casper: Tycho, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes, so supply chain, as you step back and almost start a level above. Thermo Fisher, then get to Thermo Fisher. Now the world is clearly experiencing supply chain disruptions. And it really as the pandemic is unwinding, we're all seeing that and the duration and the impact of that still to be determined, all right? And as I think about our Company, it's really the scale of advantages we have and the incredibly strong execution capabilities we have because of our PPI Business System, it's a real competitive advantage.  All right, and we're well-positioned to navigate these environments better than the smaller or less capable companies. So that's how I think about it. As I think about Q3 there was no material impact in our results based on supply chain challenges. The areas that you see them, they're being managed with things like freight and logistics. Delivery times are a little bit slower. So you have things like that, that you have to manage through and electronic components, things of that sort.  And we're managing through those things effectively. And I have high confidence in our team's ability to navigate it in a very well -- in a very strong way. And I think we will be talking about this in some fashion across the world and across specifically [Indiscernible] in diagnostics, probably into 2022.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up on PPD. Last quarter, you talked about the second request from the FTC, and then you cut every CMA developments. I know you reiterated the timelines to close by year-end, but can you maybe just update us on how that process is going and was the CMA development expected in your view?\nMarc Casper: Yes. Tycho, in terms of PPD, it's going well and on track, so we're largely complete with the U.S. FTC process and we -- there's no surprises on the remaining couple of filings, including working with the UK government. So those are all we anticipated when we announced the transaction. So that's all progressing well, and we feel confident our ability to have the opportunity to welcome our new colleagues during the fourth quarter to Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Marc, [Indiscernible] give us an update on the durability of the investments that you've been making in testing. I want to stay conservative around the outlook for COVID, but just how are you feeling about the durability on the PCR side? Any updates you can provide around uptake at Mesa. And just a clarification. The M&A in the quarter, was that the contingent payment for Mesa?\nStephen Williamson: Certainly M&A in the quarter. That's just continued revenue from Mesa. That business is performing well.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So in terms of the durability, embedded in our outlook, from a de-risked perspective for next year is $750 million of COVID testing related revenue, and we'll obviously refine that when we give our original we started, start the year and see what the world looks like. There's obviously certain aspects of our response on the testing side that will have some level of durability, but it's a relatively modest number compared to the billions of dollars of COVID-19, the PCR tests and sample prep that we provided. The areas that you would expect to have [Indiscernible] is going to be the increased installed base of QPCR instruments in sample prep instruments, which will get repurpose for other testing. We've obviously developed respiratory panels as well.  So likely for the future you're going to see some level of people presenting with an upper respiratory infection and doctors will want to know whether it's COVID or flu or RSV. So you'll have some of that [Indiscernible]. And customer feedback on the Mesa Biotech technology. It's super positive. It's turned to a large customer, couple of days ago and they did a head-to-head versus some other technologies and basically said the users just love it and are excited about working on developing a broader menu overtime as well.  So those are some of the things that will increase our share of business post COVID, or more endemic COVID phase. And that's business that we really didn't have pre -pandemic. So I think that's pretty cold, but relative to the billions of dollars of revenue it will be more modest number.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then my second question is on Analytical instruments site, hate to nitpick small numbers as the compounded growth by my math step-down from like 4.5%, maybe 3% in the quarter. Just curious how the order book there is shaping up and can you give any color on what the guidance implies for the fourth quarter for that segment?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack Kevin, you can nitpick anything you want. It's good to focus on the areas that aren't clear. So I actually want to step back and look at analytical instruments. Actually a very solid quarter, very strong performance in electron microscopy [indiscernible] expected very well. We're super excited about ASMS, which is just upon us and exciting product launches are highlighted a few of them on the call with the TSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer. When we updated all 3 on our new UHPLC system.  When you actually look and say you look at the details on the numbers, we saw softness in parts of chemical analysis, that's really what's in there. And you haven't seen the full recovery in some of the industrial end markets. You see great strength in things that are semiconductor materials, financial ladens that shows through across our businesses. But in some of the what I'll call historically core industry. You haven't seen a full recovery over the last couple of years. So that's what is kind of embedded in the numbers.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Stephen, any color on 4Q for the segment?\nStephen Williamson: Nice we've continued good performance at business and bookings growth strong in the quarter and outlook for Q4 and '22 look very positive.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\nMarc Casper: Hi Derik?\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, so just taken a little bit follow up on Jack's question there. Any issues in shipping analytical instruments in the quarter and getting things installed means just getting into labs or logistics and remain around. I'm just wondering if 3Q is always a little bit with squarely quarter anyway, given seasonality. I just was wondering if the results with something compounded just in terms of not being able to ship some products, you get some things out the door, get some revenues recognized because of the current situations?\nMarc Casper: Nothing that jumps out at me is being significant, Derik. When I think about bookings were stronger and maybe shipping took a day or two longer or so, it could be some math in that but none of our teams talked about lab not ready shipping delays. No, nobody -- nobody used this is a discussion topic in our deeper reviews with the business. So is possibly, but nothing that jumped out as being material from that perspective. Bookings were strong, so I think that's -- that's encouraging for the upcoming few quarters.\nDerik De Bruin: Okay. And Marc, how are you thinking about wage inflation and -- and retention? And particularly this is relates to, as you think about PPD, I mean, obviously there's a big war for talent in the clinical research associate population, transitions between -- acquisitions of CRO's tend to create some volatility in terms of headcount. And I'm just thinking about you and your Biopharma services segment, how you're dealing with potential disruptions or trying to stem off some of the headwinds you could see there?\nMarc Casper: So when I think about our team, let's start with the Thermo Fisher Scientific team and make a brief comment about PPD. We have a terrific team. They have delivered these spectacular results for year-in-year-out, quarter-on-quarter out, including in very trying times of the pandemic and they make a difference. And we have done a really -- we've been really focused on ensuring that this is the best place to work. And we we've rewarded our teams. We talked last quarter about some of the additional compensation actions we've taken. We continue to do that. Recognize the strong performance.  We've invested in our facilities, training, we are recognized for world-class development training. It's just things that we continue to focus on. And that really has allowed us to have very, very strong retention of our teams. PPD is a very well-run business with a great leadership team that's navigating the environment while the business is performing very well.  There is no disruption to the integration. We're literally is lifting it as it is and running it as it is going forward. And over time, we're going to come up with some great new solutions that'll make a difference for customers, but this is a growth-oriented, customer-oriented, patients-benefit acquisition. The feedback that the PPD team that's getting on their colleagues is super positive and super excited and we're looking forward to the transition to our Company on the -- in the Fourth Quarter.\nDerik De Bruin: If I can squeeze one more in on China. How much of your portfolio is manufactured in China that would not be subjected to the buy -- or would be the sort of -- would be part of the buy-local sort of like push there. Just some idea on your manufacturing footprint there, and what we consider as being outside versus inside China?\nMarc Casper: We have very scale manufacturing facilities in China for China. And we also import a number of products into the market. And the way you can almost think about it is, if there is no local alternative for the products, you often see them imported into the country. If there is local alternatives, they often come from either our Chinese operations or other low cost regions around the world.  That's the way to think about. It's a 100% accurate as I'm sure there's some things that have low for competition that could shift into the country, but that's the strategy at a high level and that is the [Indiscernible]. We're well-positioned to support our Chinese customers. And in areas where the Chinese customers really want high degree of supply chain assuredness, things like single-use technologies. We built a very scale facility in Suzhou to be able to meet those needs.\nDerik De Bruin: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel.\nDan Arias: Morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, 2 questions for you, 1 on BioPharma and 1 on [indiscernible] if I can, On BioPharma, I'm just curious what your expected for flash spending at the end of the year here. Obviously, plenty of nuances in that segment. So do you feel like it's more or less likely to be just sort of similar to what we've seen in non-pandemic years?\nMarc Casper: Yes.So Dan, good morning. In terms of pharma biotech, business performed really well. In terms of the growth that we are delivering with a 20% -- better than 20% growth in the quarter. What we're assuming -- this is the convention we use every year. We're assuming an average year-end spend across our customer base and we really don't get visibility until right after the thanksgiving holiday. So we use that convention and that's served us well. I think most years has been average or above average. There's 1 year that it was below average from our collection over the last number. That's how we think about it.\nDan Arias: And then maybe on the NIH funding dynamic, which you've usually got a pretty decent line of sight into. As we head into next year, I'm just curious if you have a view on the budget and the way that it looks like it might be allocated just given that you have that core budget and that RPA age component, are you hearing anything about the RPA age funding and whether it would sort of just be accessible on the basic researchers. I mean, I don't want -- I don't feel -- I don't want to come out of left field with that one if that's what sounds like but it seems like that is a question in the academic world, and there really aren't too many people to ask about that so I'd figured, I'd throw it out there.\nMarc Casper: So, Dan, it's not clear yet and I think that ARFA (ph) age concept is a really important concept for the U.S., right? The way to think about it is you have defense spending, right? And defense spending prepares for all of the what could happen [Indiscernible] invest in different technologies to defend the country [Indiscernible] -H is the healthcare equivalent. It's investments and things to anticipate future challenges, as opposed to typically our researchers solving clearly known challenges that you have now.  And so I think that the fact that we're going to longer-term funding that will prepare for the next pandemic or other future challenges. I think it's fantastic and will spurt great research. How that exactly it's going to be allocated, I haven't seen any available come out, but I haven't seen the details of how that's going to be done, and I know that the U.S. is not the only country that's talking about using vehicles like this. So I think this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about what the Scientific funding is going to be like going forward in our industry and we're incredibly well-positioned to serve that.\nDan Arias: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks, Marc.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar for Evercore.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on a nice [Indiscernible] and thanks for taking my question. Marc, maybe one on fiscal [Indiscernible] guidance rates here by a couple of 100 million, looks like the base came up by 250. I'm curious where the strength is coming from. Would you say that's coming from BioPharma across-the-board? Or what is driving that base improvement?\nMarc Casper: So, Vijay, good morning. Thanks for the question. As I thought about the 2022, we obviously saw strength across our Company in Q3 and -- in the core and we flowed that entirely into the next year. And obviously, very strong performance in pharmabiotech, so that's very encouraging and it is obviously a large driver of that, but we saw, we could -- still could perform actually across the different parts of our business. So I don't want to say it reflects the portfolio of activities that we have is the way you think about the strength with core.\nVijay Kumar: And then just, I think to clarify that more, in the base now includes vaccine contribution, but this is -- I guess what you're saying is this across the board. This is not just vaccine outlook improvement, correct?\nStephen Williamson: Just to clarify, so [Indiscernible] within the guidance rate for next year, it's basically up $250 million, which includes 190 from the base plus $60 million more vaccine therapies. The combination of all of that is 250 for the core and then slightly decreased because of FX, less tailwind. The strength of the base business and back-end therapy that's being carried forward into '22.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Steve, and then just one quick one on -- on the tax side. How should we think about any potential tax reform changes in impact to Thermo?\nMarc Casper: So the guidance we've given here, it doesn't assume any significant U.S tax reform or other tax reform across the world. And we continue to monitor the changing dynamics closely in DC and advocate for changing needs to happen with the right change happens with -- with but have unintended consequences for the aggression. Revenue raise is being paid for but let's make sure if that's being done in a logical way. Company have a competitive advantage in that tax position versus other well-run companies and we expect that competitive advantage to be continued forward through whatever changes potentially can happen. So that's the best way to think about tax for the Company.\nVijay Kumar: Thank you, guys.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of [Indiscernible]\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for -- Thanks for taking the question, Marc. It's hard to find anything positive to shout out for the adjusted basis point. So the first question is just on bio -- is on bioproduction. So maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks. Can you just discuss what the base growth did this quarter. So x the COVID contribution and kind of what's implied in 4Q and 22 and any color on trends there.\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in terms of the [Indiscernible] is painful for sure. In terms of bioproduction, exactly the opposite of that which is things that are extremely robust and doing very well. So when I think about the -- I'll give it at this the Biotech and pharmaceutical level. With a little bit over 20% growth in the quarter, you had a $510 million of vaccine and therapy revenue. We saw very strong growth, excluding the contribution from vaccines and therapies as well.  When you look to the Outlook, while we don't guide obviously by segment, we would expect that from a Biotech that continues to be very strong and we're expecting a meaningful level of growth coming from that in 2022 as well. The end-market looks very robust. Scientific discoveries are very strong. Customer demand is good, and we're seeing strong interest in our clinical trials. Packaging and logistics capabilities, that bodes well. Especially, the cycle is very good and we're well-positioned to capitalize on.  I think one of the things that maybe investors don't have a 100% understanding of, if you think about what the Company looks like upon close of PPD, we have about $20 billion of revenue serving pharmaceutical and biotech. But half of that is actually serving production. And when you think about that, that's the largest position serving the production market by far. And we obviously have very attractive positions in serving both clinical trials and the research activities as well. So we're well-positioned to deliver great growth into the future.\nDan Brennan: Great thank you for that and then maybe just a high-level follow-up on at the Analyst Day. Obviously, the 7% - 9% growth outlook was stronger than expected. And I know at the time you discussed execution in LPN markets to support that outlook. We certainly feel the question from investors regarding Thermo typically has set a reasonably conservative bar and executed well against that. So just -- maybe just wondering is 7 - 9%, should we think about that similarly having any conservative advice and so can you help us think through any of the drivers or details of that guidance? Thanks Marc.\nMarc Casper: You made me smile, which is good. We haven't even gotten into the period yet, which we'll get there right in terms, we're still working on 2021 right now. But when I think about the philosophy around the 7 to 9 is the exact same philosophy that we had when we had the continued increase in growth over time at the Company. Which is you sign up for targets when you are able to do and you demonstrated you're delivering it and you have confidence in your ability to do that. And we have great confidence in our ability to deliver the 7% to 9% growth.  We're not going to cap ourselves at the 7 to 9, right? So we're going to focus on delivering as much as we can and deliver great performance. And we'll look at the strength of our end-markets and what's our share gains look like and set the appropriate annual targets. But we felt that 7 to 9 was an appropriate number. One that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to deliver and with the goal to work to the biggest possible number we can overtime.\nDan Brennan: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Welcome, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: Thanks, Marc. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just a clarification. I know 5 to 11 year - olds vaccinations were voted positively by the panel yesterday. So just wondering if that's already contemplated into this guidance. I know that was a little bit later in the day, so likely not, but I just wanted to confirm. And also on the boosters what I wanted to confirm if that is also contemplated in the fourth quarter and increased for vaccines in 2022.\nMarc Casper: So, Puneet, when I think about how we've done our outlook on vaccine and therapy, it really is based on dialogue with our customers and orders that they have given us. Some of -- some 100% on work, and some are going to say we are going to give you the work on the paperwork and some of it is in the orders. So it's less about children or boosters are those things and actually what our customer you are saying, the activity that they want. But obviously things like vaccine mandates and booster shots and children adds to the durability of the demand for vaccines and therapies. We're largely operating with our capacity so you don't get short-term swings in the volumes based on new pronouncements or you get them over time. So that's how we thought about it.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Thanks. And the last question for me, is this some capacity expansion. Could you provide a view into the need for further capacity expansion in bioproduction at this point? You open the Switzerland site for biologics production, larger vessels, pipette tube production as well that's coming onboard, Keep facility expansions that have happened. So overall just wondering what you're hearing from the biotherapeutics customers overall. And from the C-suites there, in terms of the demand and your need to further expanded capacity at this point in the cycle of post-COVID.\nMarc Casper: In general, Puneet, we have, in-flight. The activities that we need to meet the anticipated demand. Obviously, we're going to complete a lot of these projects during the course of 2022. A little bit goes into 2023. But it's largely what we have started already. If there are specific opportunities that are part of our longer-term roadmap that makes a difference. You may see us evaluate them, but there's not a long list of those. We've been very aggressive to position ourselves to meet our customers future needs. And the commitments we've gotten and that puts us in a great spot. So, that's how we thought about. So let me --\nPuneet Souda: Great thank you.\nMarc Casper: Wrap it up here and I want to thank everybody for participating and with a strong nine months behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another excellent year. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you early in 2022. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. And good morning everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base business and the vaccines and therapies response revenue, and of course core will also include the PPD acquisition. So moving on to the details in Q3, it was another excellent quarter.  Let me provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. Yet the broad-based beat versus the prior guide. Revenue was $1.2 billion higher, driven by $900 million higher testing response revenue, $250 million higher core business revenue, and $50 million more favorable core-FX. On our last earnings call, our guidance de-risk testing response revenue and we said that if there were any additional opportunities to support customer's testing needs, we'd be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L.  That's exactly what we did in Q3, in total delivering $1.55 billion of testing response revenue in the quarter. We also had a great strength in the core business. In Q3, the base business organic growth was 10%, which is 3%, or $190 million higher than included in our prior guide. Also in the core, vaccines and therapies response revenue was $60 million higher than in that prior guide, and worth $510 million for the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top-line. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top-line performance. And at the same time, execute really well on that significant growth investments.  And as a result, adjusted BPS in Q3 was a $1.30 higher than included in our prior guide. And the the components that's over achievement or a dollar from testing response revenue, $0.20 from the core business, and $0.10 from FX on the base business. Overall, another excellent quarter. Let me now provide some color on the Q3 performance. Beginning with our Q3 earnings results, as you saw on our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to GAAP EPS in the quarter with $4.79 down 1% from Q3 last year. On the top-line our Q3, reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 7% organic growth, a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange, and 1% contribution from acquisitions.  As I mentioned, the base business organic growth in the quarter was 10%. Change by our performance by geography during the quarter, North America was flat. Europe grew over 20% Asia-Pacific grew low double-digits. China grew in the low single-digits and rest of the world decline in the high single-digits. The organic growth rate by geo are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior quarters, as well as the scale of the impact of the pandemic on the base business in the prior year. Since our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, 310 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver strong productivity, which has more than offset by unfavorable business mix, and the ongoing strategic investments across that businesses.  Including investments in our colleagues, all of these are being made to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 51.4%, 90 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The decrease in gross margin had similar drivers to those I've just mentioned for adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, an increase of 190 basis points versus Q3 of 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million representing growth of 19% versus Q3 2020. It reflects our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense with a $190 million $17 million lower than Q3 last year, largely due to lower average interest rate on our debt.  Adjusted other income expense with net income in the quarter of $9 million, $7 million pile in Q3 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating effect. But the tax rate in the quarter was 14.2%. Down a 150 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were 397 million in Q3, 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet, cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System continued to be very strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, up 27% from the same period last year. And that's after investing $1.7 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short-term and investments we're making for the long-term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects some 18% dividend increase announced in February. And during the quarter we issued $3.1 billion in new debt as part of the prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. We ended Q3 with $12 billion in cash and $21.7 billion was the total debt. And leverage ratio at the end the quarter with 1.6 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.7 times on a Net debt basis.  Concluding my comments on total Company performance adjusted ROIC was 22.3%, up 740 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate exceptional returns. Now provide some color on the performance for that full business segments. Similar to last quarter's, I'll start with some spring thoughts on the impact of COVID-19 response in that segments. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the past quarters, the majority of our COVID-19 response revenue was recognized in life sciences solutions. With the remainder recognizing the public products and services, especially diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses.  Besides, those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in these segments. That does skew some of the reported in the segment margin. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q3 reported revenue in this segment increased 9%, an organic growth was 4%. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, down 600 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a positive volume leverage, which is more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q3, and organic growth with 9%.  Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by the electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 54%, and adjusted margin was 17.8%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which is partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across those segments. In respect to the diagnostics in Q3, reported revenue decreased by 5% and the segment declined organically by 5%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostic businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, down 520 basis points from the prior year. In Q3, in drug positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System, this was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the quarter. Finally, in the [Indiscernible] products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 12%, organic growth was 10%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 11%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove good volume pull-through, and productivity by our PPI Business System, which was more than offset by strategic investments.  With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're increasing full-year guidance for both 2021 and 2021. For 2021, we're banking the Q3 beat and maintaining our prior guidance assumptions for Q4. Then for 2022, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies beat from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers. This is enabling a strong beat and raise for both years reflecting the continued excellent strength of the business. I will now provide you with more detailed starting with 2021. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 21 guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, an d increasing our full-year organic growth outlook from 9% to 12%.  That includes an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full-year from 12% to 13% and an increase in the COVID-19 response revenue for the year from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, which represents $5.8 billion of testing response revenue, and $1.9 billion of vaccines and therapies response revenue. As I mentioned previously, there are no changes in the revenue assumptions in Q4 and our revised 2021 guidance. We're continuing the same de-risked approach to guidance for COVID-19 testing response revenue, and continue to assume $450 million of testing-related revenue in Q4.  There continue to be a range of outcomes we're tapping in the fourth quarter and for 2022. There's scenarios where testing demand could be higher than that included in our guidance. Should that be the case, we will be well-positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in Q3, we will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a direct approach to the Outlook. And as a reminder, there are four fewer selling days in Q4 '21, compared to the same period last year. Incorporating our very strong Q3 performance into the revised '21 guidance, we now expect that adjusted operating margins for the full-year will be approximately 30.4%, 70 basis points higher than both our prior guide, and 2020.  Then same to the adjusted EPS, by banking the Q3 beat, we are raising our full-year '21 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would result in 20% growth over 2020. The revised guidance seems an adjusted income tax rate of 14.3% in 2021, slightly higher than the prior guide to reflect the marginal tax rate on our increased profitability. The rest of the assumptions underlying that 2021 guidance remains the same. And to call out a few of those, we've not included any operational benefit in 2021 for the acquisition of PPD, which is assumed to close at the end of the year.  We expect full-year net interest costs to be approximately $510 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion a share buybacks, $1.4 billion per completed M&A, and $400 million of the capital return to shareholders through dividends. Let me estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. Now, moving on to the 2020 guidance rates. As I mentioned, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies peak from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers.  In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion. That reflects a $250 million increase in core revenue, offset positive by $50 million less FX tailwind for the year. The guidance for 2022 continues to see in core organic growth of 8% and $750 million of testing response revenue for the year. In terms of the adjusted EPS, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. As Marc mentioned, the 2022 guidance increase reflects the increased strength of our core business, adding to the already very strong outlook for 2022. As I shared with you at the recent Investor Day. So to conclude, we're delivering another ex -- we delivered another excellent quarter and are in great position to achieve both our '21 and 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Certainly M&A in the quarter. That's just continued revenue from Mesa. That business is performing well. Nice we've continued good performance at business and bookings growth strong in the quarter and outlook for Q4 and '22 look very positive. Just to clarify, so [Indiscernible] within the guidance rate for next year, it's basically up $250 million, which includes 190 from the base plus $60 million more vaccine therapies. The combination of all of that is 250 for the core and then slightly decreased because of FX, less tailwind. The strength of the base business and back-end therapy that's being carried forward into '22."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks, Raf. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Third Quarter call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, achieving exceptional financial performance while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. As I reflect on the year so far, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is driving outstanding financial performance. Our base business is performing very well and we're playing a leading role in our industry's response to COVID-19. And we continue to build on our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our unique customer value proposition.  All of this gives me great confidence and a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, I will get into more detail on these in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q3 increased to $9.33 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $2.78 billion and our adjusted operating margin was 29.8% for the quarter. Finally, we increased adjusted EPS by 2% - $5.76 per share.  So another outstanding quarter. Turning to our end markets in Q3, market conditions were strong and our team executed well to deliver another fantastic quarter. Starting with Pharma and Biotech, we continue to have outstanding performance in this end market with growth of just over 20% driven once again by strong market dynamics, our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  Our trusted partner status earned over many years with these customers continues to drive robust growth. In this end market, we saw a broad-based strength, including in our bioproduction, pharma services, Biosciences, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as in the Research and Safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the mid-single-digits in the quarter with very good growth in Biosciences, and the Research and Safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens. In Q3, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in the Research and Safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined 11%. Performance in our base business was strong, driven by immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostics.  The team also executed very well to support customers COVID-19 testing needs, delivering $1.55 billion of revenue this quarter versus $1.8 billion in Q3 last year. Before I move on to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our industry-leading role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.05 billion in COVID-19 response-related revenue. With the surge in the Delta variant, we saw a strong testing demand around the world in Q3. We also played a very meaningful role in vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 generating just over $500 million in the quarter from these activities.  The underlying demand for our product and service offerings used in the production and development of vaccines is very robust and over time, we expect this demand to transition to non-COVID revenue. Our industry-leading response to the pandemic has enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy, strengthen customer relationships, and accelerate investments, which contributed to our ability to raise our long-term core organic growth guidance to 7% to 9% as we communicated at our recent Investor Day. Let me now give you an update on our growth strategy, which consists of three elements. Continuously developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale on the high-growth in emerging markets and delivering unique value proposition to our customers. Let me provide a few examples of how we're delivering on our growth strategy.  Starting with innovation, we launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and make the world a better place. In our genetic sciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems Quantz Studio Absolute Q Digital PCR system. This is the first fully integrated Digital PCR system featuring simplified workflows and designed to provide highly accurate results in only 90 minutes.  This system will help events our customers innovation efforts in areas like oncology and cell and gene therapy. And chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched three new Thermo Fisher Scientific TSQ plus triple quadruple mass spectrometers to address the growing need for faster throughput and increased sensitivity across a range of applications in Biopharma and applied science, including clinical research for large and small molecules, toxicology from Safety and environmental analysis. We also launched the Thermal Scientific Vanquish NEO UHPLC system and the Thermo Scientific Tech map Neo, UHPLC columns designed for use in proteomics precision medicine, and translational research.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers and high-growth in emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent performance we are delivering across Asia-Pacific, where we delivered growth in the low double-digits during the quarter. We continue to build our presence and capabilities in the region. During the quarter, we opened a bioprocess design center in South Korea. This facility features laboratory and educational space and more than 100 instruments that support pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes. This center will help our pharm and biotech customers advance their important work.  Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. As I mentioned last quarter, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in Capex this year. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. Building our pharma services capabilities in Q3, we brought on additional capacity online to support vaccine and therapy production.  As part of the previously announced strategic partnership with CSL limited, we assumed operating responsibility for our new state-of-the-art biologics site and like now in [Indiscernible] The site will feature highly flexible bioproduction technologies, including single-use and stainless steel to provide a pathway from development to large-scale production as customers needs evolve. To support growing demand in the biopharmaceutical industry, we announced plans to open a new bioproduction facility in Nashville, Tennessee to manufacturer single-use technologies. The facility will be one of our largest SUT sites in the world. In addition to support disease research and diagnostic testing, we announced our commitment to co-invest with the U.S. government in building a state-of-the-art facility to manufacturer pipette tips.  The new facility will be located in North Carolina and designed in line with Thermo Fisher Scientific's carbon neutrality goals. These investments are value proposition, demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in [indiscernible]. Now, let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we are super excited for acquisition of PPD. The business is performing well.  The regulatory process is on track, and we expect to close by year-end. As a reminder, PPD will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and yet highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. Integration planning is going very well. Financing is largely complete, and we're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher later this year. Before turning to our guidance, let me update you on our progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in [Indiscernible] science, we know we have a responsibility to use our industry leadership position to make the world a better place.  And to that end, we continue to advance our sustainability and social impact initiatives. During the quarter we committed to expand our use of ACT product labeling to include our entire cold storage portfolio by the end of the year. ACT labeling clearly details environmental impact of the product, empowering our customers to make sustainable choices and ultimately helping them achieve their own goals for environmental stewardship. Our 90,000 colleagues are also passionate about the difference they can make. And our local site-based community action counsels support a number of charitable and stem education activities throughout the year. We have amplified our -- supporting these efforts by investing in additional $15 million in our foundation for science.  And we continue to support the historically black colleges and universities to deliver accurate COVID-19 testing to students and staff, helping to ensure campus safety and the ability to confidently deliver in-person learning. With that, I'd like to review our guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This increase is a result of our strong Q3 operational performance in our base business. And the continued strength of our COVID-19 response revenue.  We're raising our revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, which would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by a $1.30 to $23.37 per share, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. The 2022 guidance raise reflects the increased Outlook for the core business and adds to the very strong Outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day. We're raising our 2022 full-year revenue guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion, and increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. To summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we executed very well to continue our growth momentum, and deliver excellent revenue in earnings performance. Our business is performing very well and we continue to play a leading role in the pandemic response.  We continue to expand our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanding capabilities to further enhance our customer value proposition. And our exceptional performance through the third quarter enabled us to raise our outlook for the year and sets us up for an even brighter future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen. Patrick, thanks for the question. Good morning. Obviously, really outstanding Q3. When I think about the momentum in the core business in the fourth quarter, we obviously enter the fourth quarter with very strong performance. As I look at the outlook for Q4, first, we felt it was prudent to keep it at the same that we did last quarter. There's nothing particularly deep about that. We have -- or less selling days. So when you look at the base business results, it's very similar. It implies about 9% growth, about 5% reported, and about 4 points for the day. You see here about 9% growth. So very similar to what you saw in Q3. And when you look at the other part of core, which is the vaccine and therapy numbers, similar levels of revenue to what you saw in Q3 there. So we felt that was a prudent view.  On the testing response, we kept the de-risk number. We're obviously going to shift whatever our customers need and if you think about how short the true visibility is for testing response, which is we de-risk ed at the end of July. And by the time we got into August, the Delta variant had creating huge demand for testing. So we feel that the 450 number is one that we have incredibly high likelihood of achieving and we'll obviously shift, meaning it could work. And that other customers need it. So that's how we've thought about. And for -- as we talked about 2022, we carried forward the core revenue beat into the year. And as we sit here at the end of January, when we give our full year, our final guidance for the year we'll look at what is the right level of assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate. I think given the way your offset by over their questions for us explains what's going on, which is we had low single-digit growth. In the year-ago period, we had an incredibly strong COVID response revenue in China. So that drives there. When I look at bookings which gives you a sense of new orders, that grew about 10% in the quarter. So that activity was good. We have a strong backlog there and reviewing what's going on with our local team. No. Conditions actually continue to be good and the government's focused on some of the initiatives that will drive strong long-term growth. Focus on Biotech industry and food safety, those kinds of things. So I think China ultimately continues to be a nice, strong growth market for the Company going forward. Tycho, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes, so supply chain, as you step back and almost start a level above. Thermo Fisher, then get to Thermo Fisher. Now the world is clearly experiencing supply chain disruptions. And it really as the pandemic is unwinding, we're all seeing that and the duration and the impact of that still to be determined, all right? And as I think about our Company, it's really the scale of advantages we have and the incredibly strong execution capabilities we have because of our PPI Business System, it's a real competitive advantage.  All right, and we're well-positioned to navigate these environments better than the smaller or less capable companies. So that's how I think about it. As I think about Q3 there was no material impact in our results based on supply chain challenges. The areas that you see them, they're being managed with things like freight and logistics. Delivery times are a little bit slower. So you have things like that, that you have to manage through and electronic components, things of that sort.  And we're managing through those things effectively. And I have high confidence in our team's ability to navigate it in a very well -- in a very strong way. And I think we will be talking about this in some fashion across the world and across specifically [Indiscernible] in diagnostics, probably into 2022. Yes. Tycho, in terms of PPD, it's going well and on track, so we're largely complete with the U.S. FTC process and we -- there's no surprises on the remaining couple of filings, including working with the UK government. So those are all we anticipated when we announced the transaction. So that's all progressing well, and we feel confident our ability to have the opportunity to welcome our new colleagues during the fourth quarter to Thermo Fisher Scientific. You're welcome. Yes. So in terms of the durability, embedded in our outlook, from a de-risked perspective for next year is $750 million of COVID testing related revenue, and we'll obviously refine that when we give our original we started, start the year and see what the world looks like. There's obviously certain aspects of our response on the testing side that will have some level of durability, but it's a relatively modest number compared to the billions of dollars of COVID-19, the PCR tests and sample prep that we provided. The areas that you would expect to have [Indiscernible] is going to be the increased installed base of QPCR instruments in sample prep instruments, which will get repurpose for other testing. We've obviously developed respiratory panels as well.  So likely for the future you're going to see some level of people presenting with an upper respiratory infection and doctors will want to know whether it's COVID or flu or RSV. So you'll have some of that [Indiscernible]. And customer feedback on the Mesa Biotech technology. It's super positive. It's turned to a large customer, couple of days ago and they did a head-to-head versus some other technologies and basically said the users just love it and are excited about working on developing a broader menu overtime as well.  So those are some of the things that will increase our share of business post COVID, or more endemic COVID phase. And that's business that we really didn't have pre -pandemic. So I think that's pretty cold, but relative to the billions of dollars of revenue it will be more modest number. Yes. So Jack Kevin, you can nitpick anything you want. It's good to focus on the areas that aren't clear. So I actually want to step back and look at analytical instruments. Actually a very solid quarter, very strong performance in electron microscopy [indiscernible] expected very well. We're super excited about ASMS, which is just upon us and exciting product launches are highlighted a few of them on the call with the TSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer. When we updated all 3 on our new UHPLC system.  When you actually look and say you look at the details on the numbers, we saw softness in parts of chemical analysis, that's really what's in there. And you haven't seen the full recovery in some of the industrial end markets. You see great strength in things that are semiconductor materials, financial ladens that shows through across our businesses. But in some of the what I'll call historically core industry. You haven't seen a full recovery over the last couple of years. So that's what is kind of embedded in the numbers. Thanks Jack. Hi Derik? Nothing that jumps out at me is being significant, Derik. When I think about bookings were stronger and maybe shipping took a day or two longer or so, it could be some math in that but none of our teams talked about lab not ready shipping delays. No, nobody -- nobody used this is a discussion topic in our deeper reviews with the business. So is possibly, but nothing that jumped out as being material from that perspective. Bookings were strong, so I think that's -- that's encouraging for the upcoming few quarters. So when I think about our team, let's start with the Thermo Fisher Scientific team and make a brief comment about PPD. We have a terrific team. They have delivered these spectacular results for year-in-year-out, quarter-on-quarter out, including in very trying times of the pandemic and they make a difference. And we have done a really -- we've been really focused on ensuring that this is the best place to work. And we we've rewarded our teams. We talked last quarter about some of the additional compensation actions we've taken. We continue to do that. Recognize the strong performance.  We've invested in our facilities, training, we are recognized for world-class development training. It's just things that we continue to focus on. And that really has allowed us to have very, very strong retention of our teams. PPD is a very well-run business with a great leadership team that's navigating the environment while the business is performing very well.  There is no disruption to the integration. We're literally is lifting it as it is and running it as it is going forward. And over time, we're going to come up with some great new solutions that'll make a difference for customers, but this is a growth-oriented, customer-oriented, patients-benefit acquisition. The feedback that the PPD team that's getting on their colleagues is super positive and super excited and we're looking forward to the transition to our Company on the -- in the Fourth Quarter. We have very scale manufacturing facilities in China for China. And we also import a number of products into the market. And the way you can almost think about it is, if there is no local alternative for the products, you often see them imported into the country. If there is local alternatives, they often come from either our Chinese operations or other low cost regions around the world.  That's the way to think about. It's a 100% accurate as I'm sure there's some things that have low for competition that could shift into the country, but that's the strategy at a high level and that is the [Indiscernible]. We're well-positioned to support our Chinese customers. And in areas where the Chinese customers really want high degree of supply chain assuredness, things like single-use technologies. We built a very scale facility in Suzhou to be able to meet those needs. You're welcome. Yes.So Dan, good morning. In terms of pharma biotech, business performed really well. In terms of the growth that we are delivering with a 20% -- better than 20% growth in the quarter. What we're assuming -- this is the convention we use every year. We're assuming an average year-end spend across our customer base and we really don't get visibility until right after the thanksgiving holiday. So we use that convention and that's served us well. I think most years has been average or above average. There's 1 year that it was below average from our collection over the last number. That's how we think about it. So, Dan, it's not clear yet and I think that ARFA (ph) age concept is a really important concept for the U.S., right? The way to think about it is you have defense spending, right? And defense spending prepares for all of the what could happen [Indiscernible] invest in different technologies to defend the country [Indiscernible] -H is the healthcare equivalent. It's investments and things to anticipate future challenges, as opposed to typically our researchers solving clearly known challenges that you have now.  And so I think that the fact that we're going to longer-term funding that will prepare for the next pandemic or other future challenges. I think it's fantastic and will spurt great research. How that exactly it's going to be allocated, I haven't seen any available come out, but I haven't seen the details of how that's going to be done, and I know that the U.S. is not the only country that's talking about using vehicles like this. So I think this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about what the Scientific funding is going to be like going forward in our industry and we're incredibly well-positioned to serve that. You're welcome. So, Vijay, good morning. Thanks for the question. As I thought about the 2022, we obviously saw strength across our Company in Q3 and -- in the core and we flowed that entirely into the next year. And obviously, very strong performance in pharmabiotech, so that's very encouraging and it is obviously a large driver of that, but we saw, we could -- still could perform actually across the different parts of our business. So I don't want to say it reflects the portfolio of activities that we have is the way you think about the strength with core. So the guidance we've given here, it doesn't assume any significant U.S tax reform or other tax reform across the world. And we continue to monitor the changing dynamics closely in DC and advocate for changing needs to happen with the right change happens with -- with but have unintended consequences for the aggression. Revenue raise is being paid for but let's make sure if that's being done in a logical way. Company have a competitive advantage in that tax position versus other well-run companies and we expect that competitive advantage to be continued forward through whatever changes potentially can happen. So that's the best way to think about tax for the Company. Thanks, Vijay. Yeah. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in terms of the [Indiscernible] is painful for sure. In terms of bioproduction, exactly the opposite of that which is things that are extremely robust and doing very well. So when I think about the -- I'll give it at this the Biotech and pharmaceutical level. With a little bit over 20% growth in the quarter, you had a $510 million of vaccine and therapy revenue. We saw very strong growth, excluding the contribution from vaccines and therapies as well.  When you look to the Outlook, while we don't guide obviously by segment, we would expect that from a Biotech that continues to be very strong and we're expecting a meaningful level of growth coming from that in 2022 as well. The end-market looks very robust. Scientific discoveries are very strong. Customer demand is good, and we're seeing strong interest in our clinical trials. Packaging and logistics capabilities, that bodes well. Especially, the cycle is very good and we're well-positioned to capitalize on.  I think one of the things that maybe investors don't have a 100% understanding of, if you think about what the Company looks like upon close of PPD, we have about $20 billion of revenue serving pharmaceutical and biotech. But half of that is actually serving production. And when you think about that, that's the largest position serving the production market by far. And we obviously have very attractive positions in serving both clinical trials and the research activities as well. So we're well-positioned to deliver great growth into the future. You made me smile, which is good. We haven't even gotten into the period yet, which we'll get there right in terms, we're still working on 2021 right now. But when I think about the philosophy around the 7 to 9 is the exact same philosophy that we had when we had the continued increase in growth over time at the Company. Which is you sign up for targets when you are able to do and you demonstrated you're delivering it and you have confidence in your ability to do that. And we have great confidence in our ability to deliver the 7% to 9% growth.  We're not going to cap ourselves at the 7 to 9, right? So we're going to focus on delivering as much as we can and deliver great performance. And we'll look at the strength of our end-markets and what's our share gains look like and set the appropriate annual targets. But we felt that 7 to 9 was an appropriate number. One that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to deliver and with the goal to work to the biggest possible number we can overtime. Welcome, Dan. So, Puneet, when I think about how we've done our outlook on vaccine and therapy, it really is based on dialogue with our customers and orders that they have given us. Some of -- some 100% on work, and some are going to say we are going to give you the work on the paperwork and some of it is in the orders. So it's less about children or boosters are those things and actually what our customer you are saying, the activity that they want. But obviously things like vaccine mandates and booster shots and children adds to the durability of the demand for vaccines and therapies. We're largely operating with our capacity so you don't get short-term swings in the volumes based on new pronouncements or you get them over time. So that's how we thought about it. In general, Puneet, we have, in-flight. The activities that we need to meet the anticipated demand. Obviously, we're going to complete a lot of these projects during the course of 2022. A little bit goes into 2023. But it's largely what we have started already. If there are specific opportunities that are part of our longer-term roadmap that makes a difference. You may see us evaluate them, but there's not a long list of those. We've been very aggressive to position ourselves to meet our customers future needs. And the commitments we've gotten and that puts us in a great spot. So, that's how we thought about. So let me -- Wrap it up here and I want to thank everybody for participating and with a strong nine months behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another excellent year. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you early in 2022. Thanks everyone."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2021 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Raf and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. As I reflect on the first half of the year, three things stand out to me: first, our team\u2019s exceptional execution operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we\u2019re already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI business system, which enables our performance. These three factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. I\u2019ll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. Turning to our end markets, we continue to see excellent conditions driven by three factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally, and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team has allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter.  Starting with pharma and biotech, we had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bio production, pharma services, bio sciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and in our research and safety market channel. We are clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we\u2019ve earned over many years with these customers. In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in bio sciences, electron microscopy, and the research and safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business.  Finally in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the high teens during the quarter and we\u2019re seeing customer demand in our base business approach pre-pandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and healthcare, demand for COVID-19 testing related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response and delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making, and we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all non-executive colleagues with a special recognition payment of two weeks\u2019 additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on three pillars: launching high impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. I\u2019ll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few.  In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQX Tribrid mass spectrometer which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis for metabolized and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. In our bio sciences business, we launched several new products including two instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorting tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1, and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Spectrometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in the high growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single use technology facility in Suzhou. In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country\u2019s response to the pandemic. We also have contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we\u2019re creating a differentiated experience for our customers and the significant investments that we\u2019ve made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021 we\u2019re executing on over $2.5 billion in capex to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It\u2019s exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. For example, during the quarter we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers\u2019 production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina, expanding our single use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah, and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in the mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in their work. During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition positions us to move science forward. For example, we\u2019re collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity, and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical next-gen sequencing, immunology, and clinical mass spectrometry.  In addition, we announced that we\u2019ll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. As always, our PPI business system was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale, and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest growing end market. The integration plan is going extremely well. I\u2019ve been very impressed with the world-class talent I\u2019ve met during the integration planning process. We\u2019re looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We\u2019re moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy, and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to do business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021.  Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will cover the assumptions behind our guidance, I\u2019ll cover the highlights. We\u2019re raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020.  Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2.  Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI business system is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results and positioned us to deliver a fantastic 2021, and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers, and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin with a high level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenue 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2 we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate excellent pull through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow - overall, another excellent quarter. Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions, and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter, North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits.  Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44% and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partly offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near and long term growth. Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the non-executive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investment in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $13 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This was 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pre-tax profit.  Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, the cash flow performance enabled by our PPI business system was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that\u2019s after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong return we\u2019re generating in the short term and the investments we\u2019re making for the long term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, and 0.9 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.  Now I\u2019ll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I\u2019ll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last three quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in life science solutions with the remainder recognized in laboratory products and services and specialty diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. Moving onto the segment details, starting with life science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37% and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our bio sciences and bio production businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in life sciences solutions increased 39% and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull through and saw positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2 and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 107% and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year over year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume and pull through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we\u2019re making across this segment. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 25% and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. Finally in the [indiscernible] products and services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%, organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59% and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter we delivered positive volume leverage and favorable business mix, and that was partially offset by strategic investments.  With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. In terms of revenue, we\u2019re raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%.  The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021, and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. Starting with the base business, here we\u2019re increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting our great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong and we\u2019re executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. Moving onto COVID-19 response revenue, our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly de-risk the outlook for testing. We\u2019ve lowered the full year testing related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We\u2019re now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over a billion dollars to go in the second half. There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we\u2019d be well positioned to support customer needs and will flow this benefit back through our P&L; but for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to de-risk the outlook. The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They went favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. The net of this result is an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year, which is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I\u2019ve just outlined, we\u2019re increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020.  The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. We\u2019ve not included any operational benefit in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we\u2019ll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS as a placeholder for pre-financing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We\u2019re assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A, and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count to be 397 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on the phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we are assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and we\u2019re in great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on a solid [indiscernible] this morning. Marc, one on the guidance here. Overall revenues were up, increased by $300 million for the year, but your COVID response revenues were lower by 600 and the implied math on base is it\u2019s up 850 million ex-FX contribution. That\u2019s a big number, and that\u2019s all coming here--you know, most of it seems to be in the back half. I\u2019m curious, what changed versus the prior assumptions, which segments are coming in better? Clearly we saw analytical tech come in better, and I\u2019m curious if it has any implications for fiscal \u201922.\nMarc Casper: Yes Vijay, thanks for the question. As I look at the base business outlook, really incredibly strong Q2. The performance, the 27% base business organic growth, the business is really firing on all cylinders, and orders were very strong. The informal dialog you have with customers is very bullish about market conditions and also, more importantly, our role in supporting them, and that gave us confidence that 12% organic growth for our base business activities is an appropriate guidance for the full year, so we feel really good about that. You\u2019re seeing the benefits of the acceleration in our growth strategy investments that we started in the second half of last year. You\u2019re seeing those things start to come into the new products that we launched, the collaborations, new capabilities. It\u2019s really a super exciting time, and we\u2019re excited about it in terms of what the fundamental outlook is for the base business.\nVijay Kumar: Understood, and one for us, Stephen, on the margins here, I think you called it out, one time or maybe two weeks of extra pay. What was the impact, and is that expected to continue in the second half? I think you mentioned a billion dollars of testing in back half, and I think the comment you used was it\u2019s de-risked, so I\u2019m curious, do you have any tenders for orders that gives visibility into those numbers?\nMarc Casper: Stephen, why don\u2019t you do the margin, and I\u2019ll talk about the testing.\nStephen Williamson: Yes, when we think about the mix of change in our guidance, it brought down the margin profile for the full year down to about 29.7%, which is down about 15 basis points from what I\u2019d assumed in my prior guide. That\u2019s kind of taken into consideration the different mix of contribution margins in the revenue changes. \nMarc Casper: Yes, and in terms of the response revenue and on the testing side of the equation, we took this strategy around de-risking the outlook. We had a strong quarter, actually, at $1.4 billion of testing, felt reasonably good about that, and we actually have a number of orders for the second half. We felt that given how much dialog there is around testing just generally and so much noise, we just felt that taking that off the table felt like the right thing to do, and we\u2019re well positioned, as you know, given our relationships and capacity. If things like the delta variant continue to drive more demand for testing, then obviously we\u2019re going to be higher than the number we assumed in the guidance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. \nDoug Schenkel: Hey guys, can you hear me?\nMarc Casper: Perfectly.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties. I guess a question as we think about 2022, and I know you\u2019re not going to guide on this call and I\u2019m going to apologize for--\nMarc Casper: Don\u2019t apologize.\nDoug Schenkel: But I mean, at some level, to maybe just cut to the chase, is it reasonable to take the three-year revenue and EPS targets from your 2019 analyst day at the mid to high end, layer in some lingering COVID-19 relief revenue at the top and bottom line, and then add in whatever we\u2019re going to model for PPD and basically take those three components and add them up and use that as kind of a construct for thinking about 2022? Is there any reason to not just boil it down to that construct at this point?\nMarc Casper: Doug, I\u2019m going to give you terrific news, which is we\u2019re going to hold an analyst day on September 17 and we\u2019re going to give some early thoughts about 2022 to help with some of the ways to think about modeling, and not what I would call official guidance for the year but at least some scenarios to help that, and then give the three-year outlook going forward. We thought an analyst day would be the best way, because we think it\u2019s a great question. What I would say, as you think about between now and whatever it is, seven weeks now, as for 2022, the performance of the base business is super cool - you know, 12% organic growth. We\u2019re going to be entering the year with a very strong order book with very strong momentum, and more and more of those investments that we\u2019ve made and are making positions us for great momentum in 2022.  We\u2019re going to play a meaningful role in what our customers need on their response, right? 2022 seems like a long way off, but I\u2019d say obviously vaccines and therapies are going to be super relevant and there will be testing, the question is at what level. We\u2019ll try to do some scenarios to help with that, but nobody knows what the demand is going to be for testing next year, so there will be range of outcomes around that, but I\u2019m excited. PPD, obviously you\u2019d add whatever assumptions for next year to the numbers from a capital deployment perspective, so 2022 is going to be another great year for the company.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, all right. Thanks for that, Marc. Then I guess as my follow-up, maybe I\u2019ll just throw the two quick ones out there. The first is as you know as well as anybody, there is a ton of labs globally that built out new infrastructure for COVID-19 testing using Thermo products. What are you seeing at these sites now? Testing volumes, they\u2019re slowing but still robust. What I\u2019m curious about is as we move towards the fall, are you seeing these labs move more into four-in-one testing, and then I guess beyond that, is there any move toward broader infectious disease testing at these sites, because I think that would help us as we think about the durability of what\u2019s occurred in that category. Then the other one I just want to sneak in for Stephen, COVID-19 revenue has clearly been a boon to operating margins. That said, underlying margin seems to be tracking quite nicely. Maybe I should be able to do this math real quick, but I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m just wondering, if you take COVID-19 revenue contributions out of your 2021 targets, where do you believe 2021 operating margin would come out? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Those would be good two or three-hour long conversations, but I\u2019ll take a shot at it, and Stephen, certainly feel free to add. When I think about the COVID testing demand and what are we seeing, what I would say is we obviously have built--we have and had built during the pandemic a huge installed base around the world. For us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity, so a lot of what we read about is what\u2019s going in the U.S., and the U.S. testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously cases are starting to increase, but there\u2019s quite a bit of demand around the world and certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season, and obviously we\u2019ll have that. We\u2019re going to support our customers at whatever level of demand that they need. In terms of margins, I\u2019ll make it sort of what\u2019s the philosophy, and then Stephen, if you want to add, feel free. We\u2019re not thinking about it base business versus COVID, we\u2019re thinking about how do we manage the company appropriately in terms of the profitability of the company and the investment rate for the going forward. I think one of the things that if you kind of do very simple math, and I\u2019ll do it from an EPS perspective, we raised our--based on the very strong outlook for the year and the very strong first half, we raised our EPS by $0.10 in the guidance. We chose to invest another $0.25 in our colleagues, right - the $100 million in the Q2 additional payment is an investment in the future, right, so we made a conscious decision. Obviously margins are very strong and we\u2019ll manage that appropriately. It really highlights the power of our PPI business system. \nStephen Williamson: Yes, we\u2019re really just focused on that. When you maximize the top line opportunity, invest appropriately for the future, it pays--we\u2019re getting great--we\u2019ll get the right returns off that investment, and then the flow through then comes, so it\u2019s less that we\u2019re trying to manage to a margin expansion number than appropriately manage the P&L and invest appropriately for the future.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Doug.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research\nJack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. Marc, was hoping you could give us your latest thinking on capital allocation within the--you know, if I go back to the 2019 analyst day, you talked about $29 billion of deployment through 2022, though I think there\u2019s a view in the market that it could be a lot higher than that because of the COVID response sales, so my question is what\u2019s your latest view on ability to close deals as the multiples seem to be moving higher, and if not, why not do more buybacks? You\u2019ve only done $3.5 billion since the beginning of 2020.\nMarc Casper: Jack, thanks for the question. In terms of capital deployment, first of all, it\u2019s been an active year between--and I\u2019ll give you an update on PPD in a minute, but it\u2019s been an active year. We obviously announced PPD, we\u2019ve done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions, so we\u2019ve been active. Our pipeline is quite busy. We\u2019re looking at things, we\u2019re disciplined, and because our industry is so large and fragmented, we\u2019re seeing opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that, so from that perspective things are good. From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and increasing the dividend felt like the right return, given the M&A commitments we\u2019ve made to PPD, and we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our board periodically and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus.  PPD, I\u2019ll spend a moment there because it\u2019s a large commitment of capital. I\u2019ve been super impressed with the team. I\u2019ve gotten to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It\u2019s going very smoothly, the colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. As you see from some of the other companies in the CRL field that are reporting, the end markets are super good, the industry is doing well. PPD as a leader is very well positioned, so this is going to be a really good growth asset.  From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we\u2019ve gotten most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done, still got a little bit left to do there but that\u2019s pretty much done. We\u2019re working our way through the various anti-trust filings around the world, we\u2019re collaborating with the FDC on second request, and we\u2019re looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year, so that\u2019s a quick recap on capital deployment.\nStephen Williamson: Yes, and Jack, one thing to add. When I think back to 2019, the outlook around that use of cash and ROI, we put significantly higher investments in capex. We\u2019ve identified some great opportunities to invest organically, and we\u2019re putting cash to work and getting great returns in really a short period of time as well, so that\u2019s another element as I think about how the company\u2019s evolved over that period of time.\nJack Meehan: Yes, definitely hear you on that. Just as a follow-up either for Marc or for Stephen, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around inflation across the market, so I was curious to get your view, just ability to toggle pricing as a lever in the channel, how that is going, and then any thoughts around the supply chain, have you had any issues?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, I think when you look at the world, it\u2019s unwinding from the recessionary impacts of the pandemic, and as a result you\u2019ve got kinks in supply chain and clearly inflationary pressures in multiple different places. How large that impact is and how long it lasts for is still to be proven out. We\u2019re operating on the basis that it will be with us for some time. Our PPI business system enables us to effectively navigate events like this and run our operations efficiently, use our scale to partner with suppliers, and then maximize opportunities, as you mentioned, around pricing for certain products to help protect our margins. That\u2019s not just [indiscernible] really across the portfolio, that\u2019s kind of the scale benefit of using our pricing discipline across the company, and we\u2019ve navigated through this dynamic really well through the first half of the year, and I expect us to continue to do so going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good morning. Marc, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the recovery in analytical instruments. I know you said it was widespread, but you did call out electron microscopy a couple times, so could you maybe just talk to that dynamic, how much of that do you think is pent-up demand how much of that is tied to the semi-cycle? Just curious for some more color there. \nMarc Casper: Tycho, good morning, thanks for the questions. Yes, our analytical instruments business performed extremely well, grew over 35% in the quarter, and all three businesses really performed very well - chemical analysis, chrom and mass spec, and materials and structural analysis [indiscernible]. When I think about the dynamics here, our new products, they\u2019re very exciting, I mentioned a few of them this quarter as I did last, so the investments we\u2019ve been making in R&D there are really paying off, and the end markets are good. You see that in electron microscopy, both in the adoption of the tools for life sciences applications, so the cryo electron microscopy, but you also see that across the material science applications, including semiconductor, and obviously from everything you read around what\u2019s going on in chip supply and investments there, that bodes well for the electron microscopy business for sure.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thanks. Then for the follow-up, I\u2019ve actually got two quick ones. On COVID, I think you made a prudent move to take testing down. Just curious your latest thoughts on the durability on the vaccine and therapy side, what you\u2019re hearing from customers, obviously a lot of focus on boosters now. Then on margins, I know a lot of people are focused on 2022 operating margins. You did take up R&D by 20% last year, so maybe another way to ask the question is, how much of the opex do you think will carry through, or do you think you\u2019ll reset R&D a little bit to drive more leverage? Thanks.\nStephen Williamson: Tycho, let me cover the margin question. I think the elevated investments are getting great returns, so we\u2019re going to manage the company appropriately, spend appropriately, and have fueled really strong base business organic growth going forward. Should those returns not be in the right places, we\u2019re going to obviously appropriately manage spend, and then as the pandemic response unwinds, we will appropriately deal with the variable costs that go with that and manage the P&L appropriately. We look forward to giving more details when we\u2019re in a better position to do that around 2022.\nMarc Casper: Tycho, in terms of the role that we\u2019re playing in supporting the vaccines and therapies for COVID, it\u2019s quite significant, right, and it cuts across both our pharma services capabilities for the active ingredients [indiscernible] as well as in the sterile fill/finish activities for the vaccines. We play obviously a very substantial role as the technology provider in our bio sciences business with things like enzymes, nucleotides, as well as in our single use technologies and cell culture media, so a very large role. We expect that to be about $1.8 billion this year. Demand is very robust, right, so for the industry it\u2019s mostly about capacity coming online to support the demand, so we look at our momentum going into 2022, we would expect that the vaccine and therapy demand to be very strong given the likely demand for the response to the pandemic, and as our capacity comes more and more online, that positions us very well to meet the strong backlog of orders that we\u2019ve been able to generate because we have the right solutions for our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Good morning guys, thanks for the question. Marc, on the new plasmid production site out in Carlsbad, I think you just opened up there, so when do you expect to be fully scaled up and going? Is there anything you can say about the extent to which capacity has already been booked there, just given that it sounds like that\u2019s a pretty supply constrained area? Then I think you\u2019re supporting mRNA vaccine work out there and I\u2019m just curious whether you\u2019re starting to talk to customers about projects maybe down the road with them on mRNA vaccines that are not related to COVID. Just thinking one of the open questions here is where are we headed with mRNA now that we have some proof of concept.\nMarc Casper: Dan, great question. A few different things that are going on. Let\u2019s do the mRNA more broadly first. There has been a huge increase in investments in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry given the success that mRNA has had on the COVID vaccine, so that investment is both in next generation vaccines, combination vaccines, as well as just in the class of other diseases altogether. And yes, we\u2019re in numerous dialogs in supporting those activities across our capabilities, so that\u2019s a wonderful tailwind for our largest segment of pharma and biotech in terms of customers, so that looks very strong. One of the things that we have seen is that in plasmid DNA, there has been a shortage of capacity for some period of time, and we\u2019ve been addressing that by making significant organic investments. We have been able to secure meaningful orders for our new facility in Carlsbad. I had the opportunity to visit the facility in June - it\u2019s awesome and super exciting. It\u2019s open - and we just did the ribbon cutting in early July, and we\u2019ll be producing product in the not distant future there and building momentum on that, and that\u2019s great. The customer base wanted choice and we\u2019re giving them choice, and we\u2019re excited about that. \nDan Arias: Okay, appreciate that. Maybe just Stephen, just thinking about some of the other parts of bio production, on Novasep, I think the outlook last time was for $150 million in contributions from Novasep. Is that still the current outlook, because I felt like that was conservative last quarter just given that you had done almost half that, if not a little bit more than half that in Q1 alone, so just wanted to check.\nStephen Williamson: Yes, we secured some additional orders on the COVID response and it\u2019s slightly higher - it\u2019s about another $30 million to $40 million for the year, and that\u2019s included in that increasing guide for the response revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. A couple questions. I guess on the first one, can you talk a little bit about the China market - obviously it wasn\u2019t going to be as strong in the second quarter as it was in the first quarter, the growth, just given that China started to recover in the second quarter, but it was a little bit lower than I would have thought. Can you talk about the dynamics in the Chinese market?\nMarc Casper: Yes, China is performing very well. When I think about the growth in the quarter of just under 30%, we\u2019ve got 40% growth in the first half. I spent time with the team, activities have returned to pretty much normal. The [indiscernible] five-year plan is being implemented and that has tailwinds for our industry, and Thermo Fisher is well positioned to capitalize also, so I think about China in terms of our outlook and it\u2019s off to a good start through the first half of the year.\nDerik de Bruin : Got it. I\u2019m going to squeeze two in. I guess the first one is, can you talk a little bit about academic and government and what you\u2019re seeing in that market? That 35% growth, is any of that, do you think, tied to new funding that\u2019s coming up, is there a pick-up or is that just catch-up spending? Then another question I keep getting from people is I still think there\u2019s some concern over the impact of PPD on the margin, given it\u2019s more of a people business than a razor and blade business. Just your general thoughts on the margin opportunity in PPD, thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so Derik, academic and government had a very good quarter, 35% growth, that\u2019s exciting. As you think about academic and government, obviously it was one of those segments of the four end markets we serve that was very affected last year in 2020 because of the pandemic, and in the second quarter, that\u2019s really the place you saw it the most. What you\u2019re seeing now is largely activity has returned back to normal around the world - I mean, it might be different, but actually the activity level is pretty normal, and what I\u2019m encouraged about is two things . One is widespread in terms of the performance across our businesses - you know, bio sciences, research and safety market channel that talks about activity is very high, and electron microscopy really excellent funding, so it talks about sort of the big capital funding there also was strong. Then when you look going forward, that really does look good because there\u2019s so much positive talk around the world about the funding. \nStephen Williamson: Then on PPD, Derik, the margin profile of that whole industry is significantly lower than the company average, and knowing that eyes wide open going into this, the investment thesis in this asset is that margin expansion--we\u2019ll get some margin expansion from cost synergies, but it will be lower than the company average expansion year-over-year but be higher than average growth business. When you think about the growth in operating income dollars, it will be very equivalent to the rest of the company, so it\u2019s just a slightly different P&L profile that we\u2019re bringing into the company and you need to factor that is as you\u2019re thinking about modeling the company going forward. It\u2019s a scale business coming in at lower than the average margins, but that doesn\u2019t change the margin profile or the margin opportunity for the rest of the company and doesn\u2019t change the great outlook that we think PPD has, and we\u2019re excited about bringing it into the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Marc, maybe one on the specialty diagnostics business - you know, it came in a bit lower than we expected. Obviously a big chunk of that is the COVID testing piece, but can you just talk about the core business trends there, what the recovery path looks like in the back half?\nMarc Casper: Yes Patrick, thanks for the question. When I look at the specialty diagnostics business, actually underlying what\u2019s going on in the business actually is quite encouraging. Activity levels are pretty much back to the pre-pandemic levels. You see it in really strong growth in our immunodiagnostics business, allergy and autoimmunity. You see it in our transplant diagnostic business. [Indiscernible] businesses were highly disrupted a year ago when procedures were put on hold, but you also saw good growth in microbiology, you saw it as well in our healthcare market channel, so it\u2019s encouraging. In terms of the--you know, you do see some of the COVID response revenue there as well, and that will have a more challenging comparison in the second half, but I feel good about the underlying outlook within specialty diagnostics.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nMarc Casper: I think Patrick just--[indiscernible].\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes, sorry, just a quick one on PPD. I know, Marc, you mentioned second response from the FTC. Just a quick update there in terms of any surprises from what the discussion has been and the confidence level there in getting that done. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: No, no surprises there. We\u2019re just working through the process and we\u2019ll work collaboratively and look forward to bringing it to a close at the end of the year. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. \nOperator: Your last question will come from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi Marc, Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick clarification for Marc--actually, for Stephen. On the COVID related, a number of points have been covered, but just in terms of the Mesa acquisition, I know you had highlighted a contribution there, maybe closer to $200 million or so. Does that still remain, or was that removed in part of the de-risking that you mentioned?  Then Marc, just broadly speaking, you mentioned a number of times Orbitrap platform continues to grow. This has been a decade-plus growth opportunity for the company. Could you, maybe just on a very high level, give us a view on where that stands today and where do you expect that to go over the next few years, and if just given the high growth areas of bio pharma and [indiscernible] where its levered to, so I\u2019d appreciate some thoughts there. Thanks so much.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks Puneet. In terms of Mesa, we\u2019re scaling up the manufacturing capacity, we\u2019re working for the longer term as well for building out the menu. It\u2019s a really exquisite technology, so we\u2019re very excited about it, and the revenue assumptions remain the same as where they were last quarter, so from that perspective, very positive. When I look at the Orbitrap, what a phenomenal technology. It continues to drive very good growth for our analytical instruments business, super relevant for our customers, and we\u2019re able to continually push the technology forward to bring out more and more relevant solutions. The most recent launch really is focused on complex small molecule analysis, but you\u2019re also planning on the technology being used in the multi-attribute method for biologics in terms of QAQC, which is a very large market opportunity and we\u2019re well positioned there, so I feel great about the performance of our chrom mass spec business and even more excited about what the future holds there as well. Puneet, thank you for the questions, and I\u2019ll turn to just wrapping it up here.\nMarc Casper: We really had an excellent first half of the year. We\u2019re on track to deliver another outstanding year and we\u2019re going to enter 2022 with great momentum that sets us up for a very bright future, and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing more about our future during our virtual analyst day on September 17, and of course then updating you in October on our Q3 call.  As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a high level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenue 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2 we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate excellent pull through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow - overall, another excellent quarter. Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions, and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter, North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits.  Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44% and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partly offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near and long term growth. Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the non-executive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investment in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $13 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This was 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pre-tax profit.  Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, the cash flow performance enabled by our PPI business system was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong return we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, and 0.9 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.  Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last three quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in life science solutions with the remainder recognized in laboratory products and services and specialty diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. Moving onto the segment details, starting with life science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37% and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our bio sciences and bio production businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in life sciences solutions increased 39% and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull through and saw positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2 and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 107% and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year over year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume and pull through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we're making across this segment. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 25% and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. Finally in the [indiscernible] products and services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%, organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59% and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter we delivered positive volume leverage and favorable business mix, and that was partially offset by strategic investments.  With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%.  The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021, and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. Starting with the base business, here we're increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting our great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong and we're executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. Moving onto COVID-19 response revenue, our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we've taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly de-risk the outlook for testing. We've lowered the full year testing related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We're now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over a billion dollars to go in the second half. There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we'd be well positioned to support customer needs and will flow this benefit back through our P&L; but for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to de-risk the outlook. The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They went favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. The net of this result is an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year, which is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I've just outlined, we're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020.  The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. We've not included any operational benefit in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS as a placeholder for pre-financing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A, and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count to be 397 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on the phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we are assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and we're in great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes, when we think about the mix of change in our guidance, it brought down the margin profile for the full year down to about 29.7%, which is down about 15 basis points from what I'd assumed in my prior guide. That's kind of taken into consideration the different mix of contribution margins in the revenue changes. Yes, we're really just focused on that. When you maximize the top line opportunity, invest appropriately for the future, it pays--we're getting great--we'll get the right returns off that investment, and then the flow through then comes, so it's less that we're trying to manage to a margin expansion number than appropriately manage the P&L and invest appropriately for the future. Yes, and Jack, one thing to add. When I think back to 2019, the outlook around that use of cash and ROI, we put significantly higher investments in capex. We've identified some great opportunities to invest organically, and we're putting cash to work and getting great returns in really a short period of time as well, so that's another element as I think about how the company's evolved over that period of time. Yes, I think when you look at the world, it's unwinding from the recessionary impacts of the pandemic, and as a result you've got kinks in supply chain and clearly inflationary pressures in multiple different places. How large that impact is and how long it lasts for is still to be proven out. We're operating on the basis that it will be with us for some time. Our PPI business system enables us to effectively navigate events like this and run our operations efficiently, use our scale to partner with suppliers, and then maximize opportunities, as you mentioned, around pricing for certain products to help protect our margins. That's not just [indiscernible] really across the portfolio, that's kind of the scale benefit of using our pricing discipline across the company, and we've navigated through this dynamic really well through the first half of the year, and I expect us to continue to do so going forward. Tycho, let me cover the margin question. I think the elevated investments are getting great returns, so we're going to manage the company appropriately, spend appropriately, and have fueled really strong base business organic growth going forward. Should those returns not be in the right places, we're going to obviously appropriately manage spend, and then as the pandemic response unwinds, we will appropriately deal with the variable costs that go with that and manage the P&L appropriately. We look forward to giving more details when we're in a better position to do that around 2022. Yes, we secured some additional orders on the COVID response and it's slightly higher - it's about another $30 million to $40 million for the year, and that's included in that increasing guide for the response revenue. Then on PPD, Derik, the margin profile of that whole industry is significantly lower than the company average, and knowing that eyes wide open going into this, the investment thesis in this asset is that margin expansion--we'll get some margin expansion from cost synergies, but it will be lower than the company average expansion year-over-year but be higher than average growth business. When you think about the growth in operating income dollars, it will be very equivalent to the rest of the company, so it's just a slightly different P&L profile that we're bringing into the company and you need to factor that is as you're thinking about modeling the company going forward. It's a scale business coming in at lower than the average margins, but that doesn't change the margin profile or the margin opportunity for the rest of the company and doesn't change the great outlook that we think PPD has, and we're excited about bringing it into the company."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks Raf and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. As I reflect on the first half of the year, three things stand out to me: first, our team's exceptional execution operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we're already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI business system, which enables our performance. These three factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. Turning to our end markets, we continue to see excellent conditions driven by three factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally, and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team has allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter.  Starting with pharma and biotech, we had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bio production, pharma services, bio sciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and in our research and safety market channel. We are clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in bio sciences, electron microscopy, and the research and safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business.  Finally in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the high teens during the quarter and we're seeing customer demand in our base business approach pre-pandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and healthcare, demand for COVID-19 testing related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response and delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making, and we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all non-executive colleagues with a special recognition payment of two weeks' additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on three pillars: launching high impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. I'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few.  In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQX Tribrid mass spectrometer which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis for metabolized and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. In our bio sciences business, we launched several new products including two instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorting tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1, and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Spectrometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in the high growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single use technology facility in Suzhou. In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country's response to the pandemic. We also have contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers and the significant investments that we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021 we're executing on over $2.5 billion in capex to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It's exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. For example, during the quarter we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers' production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina, expanding our single use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah, and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in the mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in their work. During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition positions us to move science forward. For example, we're collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity, and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical next-gen sequencing, immunology, and clinical mass spectrometry.  In addition, we announced that we'll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. As always, our PPI business system was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale, and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest growing end market. The integration plan is going extremely well. I've been very impressed with the world-class talent I've met during the integration planning process. We're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We're moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy, and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to do business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021.  Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will cover the assumptions behind our guidance, I'll cover the highlights. We're raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020.  Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2.  Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI business system is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results and positioned us to deliver a fantastic 2021, and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers, and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes Vijay, thanks for the question. As I look at the base business outlook, really incredibly strong Q2. The performance, the 27% base business organic growth, the business is really firing on all cylinders, and orders were very strong. The informal dialog you have with customers is very bullish about market conditions and also, more importantly, our role in supporting them, and that gave us confidence that 12% organic growth for our base business activities is an appropriate guidance for the full year, so we feel really good about that. You're seeing the benefits of the acceleration in our growth strategy investments that we started in the second half of last year. You're seeing those things start to come into the new products that we launched, the collaborations, new capabilities. It's really a super exciting time, and we're excited about it in terms of what the fundamental outlook is for the base business. Stephen, why don't you do the margin, and I'll talk about the testing. Yes, and in terms of the response revenue and on the testing side of the equation, we took this strategy around de-risking the outlook. We had a strong quarter, actually, at $1.4 billion of testing, felt reasonably good about that, and we actually have a number of orders for the second half. We felt that given how much dialog there is around testing just generally and so much noise, we just felt that taking that off the table felt like the right thing to do, and we're well positioned, as you know, given our relationships and capacity. If things like the delta variant continue to drive more demand for testing, then obviously we're going to be higher than the number we assumed in the guidance. Perfectly. Don't apologize. Doug, I'm going to give you terrific news, which is we're going to hold an analyst day on September 17 and we're going to give some early thoughts about 2022 to help with some of the ways to think about modeling, and not what I would call official guidance for the year but at least some scenarios to help that, and then give the three-year outlook going forward. We thought an analyst day would be the best way, because we think it's a great question. What I would say, as you think about between now and whatever it is, seven weeks now, as for 2022, the performance of the base business is super cool - you know, 12% organic growth. We're going to be entering the year with a very strong order book with very strong momentum, and more and more of those investments that we've made and are making positions us for great momentum in 2022.  We're going to play a meaningful role in what our customers need on their response, right? 2022 seems like a long way off, but I'd say obviously vaccines and therapies are going to be super relevant and there will be testing, the question is at what level. We'll try to do some scenarios to help with that, but nobody knows what the demand is going to be for testing next year, so there will be range of outcomes around that, but I'm excited. PPD, obviously you'd add whatever assumptions for next year to the numbers from a capital deployment perspective, so 2022 is going to be another great year for the company. Those would be good two or three-hour long conversations, but I'll take a shot at it, and Stephen, certainly feel free to add. When I think about the COVID testing demand and what are we seeing, what I would say is we obviously have built--we have and had built during the pandemic a huge installed base around the world. For us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity, so a lot of what we read about is what's going in the U.S., and the U.S. testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously cases are starting to increase, but there's quite a bit of demand around the world and certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season, and obviously we'll have that. We're going to support our customers at whatever level of demand that they need. In terms of margins, I'll make it sort of what's the philosophy, and then Stephen, if you want to add, feel free. We're not thinking about it base business versus COVID, we're thinking about how do we manage the company appropriately in terms of the profitability of the company and the investment rate for the going forward. I think one of the things that if you kind of do very simple math, and I'll do it from an EPS perspective, we raised our--based on the very strong outlook for the year and the very strong first half, we raised our EPS by $0.10 in the guidance. We chose to invest another $0.25 in our colleagues, right - the $100 million in the Q2 additional payment is an investment in the future, right, so we made a conscious decision. Obviously margins are very strong and we'll manage that appropriately. It really highlights the power of our PPI business system. Thanks Doug. Jack, thanks for the question. In terms of capital deployment, first of all, it's been an active year between--and I'll give you an update on PPD in a minute, but it's been an active year. We obviously announced PPD, we've done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions, so we've been active. Our pipeline is quite busy. We're looking at things, we're disciplined, and because our industry is so large and fragmented, we're seeing opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that, so from that perspective things are good. From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and increasing the dividend felt like the right return, given the M&A commitments we've made to PPD, and we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our board periodically and we'll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus.  PPD, I'll spend a moment there because it's a large commitment of capital. I've been super impressed with the team. I've gotten to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It's going very smoothly, the colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. As you see from some of the other companies in the CRL field that are reporting, the end markets are super good, the industry is doing well. PPD as a leader is very well positioned, so this is going to be a really good growth asset.  From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we've gotten most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done, still got a little bit left to do there but that's pretty much done. We're working our way through the various anti-trust filings around the world, we're collaborating with the FDC on second request, and we're looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year, so that's a quick recap on capital deployment. Tycho, good morning, thanks for the questions. Yes, our analytical instruments business performed extremely well, grew over 35% in the quarter, and all three businesses really performed very well - chemical analysis, chrom and mass spec, and materials and structural analysis [indiscernible]. When I think about the dynamics here, our new products, they're very exciting, I mentioned a few of them this quarter as I did last, so the investments we've been making in R&D there are really paying off, and the end markets are good. You see that in electron microscopy, both in the adoption of the tools for life sciences applications, so the cryo electron microscopy, but you also see that across the material science applications, including semiconductor, and obviously from everything you read around what's going on in chip supply and investments there, that bodes well for the electron microscopy business for sure. Tycho, in terms of the role that we're playing in supporting the vaccines and therapies for COVID, it's quite significant, right, and it cuts across both our pharma services capabilities for the active ingredients [indiscernible] as well as in the sterile fill/finish activities for the vaccines. We play obviously a very substantial role as the technology provider in our bio sciences business with things like enzymes, nucleotides, as well as in our single use technologies and cell culture media, so a very large role. We expect that to be about $1.8 billion this year. Demand is very robust, right, so for the industry it's mostly about capacity coming online to support the demand, so we look at our momentum going into 2022, we would expect that the vaccine and therapy demand to be very strong given the likely demand for the response to the pandemic, and as our capacity comes more and more online, that positions us very well to meet the strong backlog of orders that we've been able to generate because we have the right solutions for our customers. Dan, great question. A few different things that are going on. Let's do the mRNA more broadly first. There has been a huge increase in investments in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry given the success that mRNA has had on the COVID vaccine, so that investment is both in next generation vaccines, combination vaccines, as well as just in the class of other diseases altogether. And yes, we're in numerous dialogs in supporting those activities across our capabilities, so that's a wonderful tailwind for our largest segment of pharma and biotech in terms of customers, so that looks very strong. One of the things that we have seen is that in plasmid DNA, there has been a shortage of capacity for some period of time, and we've been addressing that by making significant organic investments. We have been able to secure meaningful orders for our new facility in Carlsbad. I had the opportunity to visit the facility in June - it's awesome and super exciting. It's open - and we just did the ribbon cutting in early July, and we'll be producing product in the not distant future there and building momentum on that, and that's great. The customer base wanted choice and we're giving them choice, and we're excited about that. Yes, China is performing very well. When I think about the growth in the quarter of just under 30%, we've got 40% growth in the first half. I spent time with the team, activities have returned to pretty much normal. The [indiscernible] five-year plan is being implemented and that has tailwinds for our industry, and Thermo Fisher is well positioned to capitalize also, so I think about China in terms of our outlook and it's off to a good start through the first half of the year. Yes, so Derik, academic and government had a very good quarter, 35% growth, that's exciting. As you think about academic and government, obviously it was one of those segments of the four end markets we serve that was very affected last year in 2020 because of the pandemic, and in the second quarter, that's really the place you saw it the most. What you're seeing now is largely activity has returned back to normal around the world - I mean, it might be different, but actually the activity level is pretty normal, and what I'm encouraged about is two things . One is widespread in terms of the performance across our businesses - you know, bio sciences, research and safety market channel that talks about activity is very high, and electron microscopy really excellent funding, so it talks about sort of the big capital funding there also was strong. Then when you look going forward, that really does look good because there's so much positive talk around the world about the funding. Yes Patrick, thanks for the question. When I look at the specialty diagnostics business, actually underlying what's going on in the business actually is quite encouraging. Activity levels are pretty much back to the pre-pandemic levels. You see it in really strong growth in our immunodiagnostics business, allergy and autoimmunity. You see it in our transplant diagnostic business. [Indiscernible] businesses were highly disrupted a year ago when procedures were put on hold, but you also saw good growth in microbiology, you saw it as well in our healthcare market channel, so it's encouraging. In terms of the--you know, you do see some of the COVID response revenue there as well, and that will have a more challenging comparison in the second half, but I feel good about the underlying outlook within specialty diagnostics. I think Patrick just--[indiscernible]. No, no surprises there. We're just working through the process and we'll work collaboratively and look forward to bringing it to a close at the end of the year. Operator, we'll take one more question. We really had an excellent first half of the year. We're on track to deliver another outstanding year and we're going to enter 2022 with great momentum that sets us up for a very bright future, and we're looking forward to sharing more about our future during our virtual analyst day on September 17, and of course then updating you in October on our Q3 call.  As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PPD's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Tracy Krumme, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for PPD. Ms. Krumme, you may begin.\nTracy Krumme: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today to share our results are David Simmons, PPD's Chairman and CEO; and Chris Scully, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause material differences in our actual results. Please refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risk. With the exception of revenue, all references to income statements results are on a non-GAAP basis. I would also like to remind you of a few important details, which are consistent with previous earnings calls. When referring to our financial performance, we'll be doing so on an ASC 606 basis. When referring to our commercial performance, including metrics related to net authorizations and backlog, we'll be doing so on a historical ASC 605 basis to maintain comparability with prior periods. Due to the recently announced transaction between PPD and Thermo Fisher Scientific, I would like to point out that we will not be conducting a Q&A session following our prepared remarks today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Simmons: Thank you, Tracy. And thank you all for joining us today. First, I'd like to start by highlighting the recent exciting news that we anticipate joining Thermo Fisher Scientific later this year. The opportunities to bring meaningful innovation to market faster and more efficiently, are as solid as ever. With that, I'm pleased to discuss our Q1 results. Since our IPO last year, we have now posted six consecutive quarters of solid financial performance as a public company. This achievement is first and foremost, a testament to the talent and culture we have at PPD and I would like to thank my colleagues for their continued dedication and relentless commitment to delivering high value services to our customers. Let me share a few Q1 highlights with you. We exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS. We posted a strong quarter of new business with net authorizations growth of 39% year-over-year. We had a backlog conversion rate of 12.4%. We realized year-over-year revenue growth of 29% with more than 25% growth in both our clinical and lab segments. And we delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 22%. Lastly, our balance sheet remained strong, with total liquidity of $1.4 billion and a net leverage ratio of 3.8 times, down from 4 times at year end. We entered the year in a position of strength, having grown our employee footprint by nearly 10% during 2020. We continue to build on this and for the second consecutive quarter grew our workforce by over 1,000 additional colleagues. We now have 27,000 employees around the globe and have maintained low turnover rates. As we welcome our new colleagues and continue to work on new and innovative development programs, the depth of our industry-leading expertise and experience continues to expand, bolstering one of the key differentiators of our performance. During 2020, we strengthened our relationships with both existing and new customers. As we remained agile in the face of the pandemic, and delivered on customer priorities, despite impediments. These relationships are flourishing as we expand our book of business with clients into new therapeutic areas or capabilities. Our experience, expertise and customer relationships have fueled continued growth in our backlog, which is well diversified across our clinical and lab segments, biopharma and biotech customers and therapeutic areas. Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate for the future. On past calls, I've shared the growth in the volume of our digitally-enabled and decentralized trials. And this past quarter, we were recognized by ISG, as a leader in digital, clinical trial solutions. We are also making strides in the real-world evidence base with additional data partnerships to build upon our leading capabilities in patient-centered research, modeling, and health economics outcomes research. As a testament to our offerings, we are seeing strong authorizations growth, proposed approval and real world evidence studies. We have momentum with our customers across both biopharma and biotech. We\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of growing R&D spend with our expertise and experience in key therapeutic areas, strong customer relationships and continued innovation. Customers are seeking to progress development of their high value assets in the current environment, regardless of therapeutic area. And lastly, we've experienced a continuation of growth in our traditional portfolio of business, which represents the lion share of our backlog. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\nChris Scully: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. I'll dive right into our results. On the commercial front, net authorizations grew 39.3% over quarter one of last year, with double-digit growth in both the clinical and lab segments. The solid performance across the business contributed to a net book-to-bill of 1.46x, one of our highest levels in recent years. We closed the quarter with record ending backlog up 18.7% over quarter one of last year. With respect to the P&L quarter one revenue grew 28.5% over quarter one of last year, underpinned by 28.3% growth in clinical and 29.5% growth in labs. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the same period was 22.4%. Similar to last quarter, our revenue growth outpaced adjusted EBITDA growth, primarily as a result of a higher mix of indirect revenue on COVID vaccine studies, which resulted in optically lower adjusted EBITDA margin. Rounding out the P&L adjusted EPS grew 45.8% year-over-year to $0.35 a share. Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with cash of $826.4 million. With respect to our liquidity, our cash balance and available revolver capacity increased our total liquidity position to $1.42 billion as of March 31, up 60.7% over the same time last year. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to just below 3.8 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, down from 4.0 time at year end and 4.5 times at March 31 2020. I'm happy to report that this marks the achievement of our pre-pandemic commitment at the time of our IPO to move into the three times range in 2021. Before wrapping up, I'd like to echo David's comments about the exciting news as we anticipate joining Thermo Fisher Scientific later this year. We envisioned that the enhanced capabilities of the combined company, united by common missions will provide significant opportunities to enable our colleagues and customers to accelerate bringing new medicines to market faster and more efficiently. And with that, operator, we will conclude the call.\nEnd of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals. Our ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world. I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivers spectacular 2022, and I couldn't be more excited for 2023. I'll get into more of the details in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share. Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets. We continue to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech, we continue to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel.  In industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. And finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our healthcare market channel. I'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering the differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights. In 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In electron microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations. We also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease. During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA sequencing system was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma. This is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in life sciences solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TruMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens. To wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs. So another spectacular year of innovation, and we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year, and I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities. We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development. As always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution. We continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share. The combination of a great first year performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine. In 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of the Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders. Reflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability roadmap, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transitions towards a 100% renewable energy. Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade. Through our Foundation for Science, we continue to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S. And throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher, and I'm excited about 2023 and beyond. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2022, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we entered 2023 with strong momentum and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year. For the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year. Taking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year. That's a great accomplishment. Then using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year. Let me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year. On the top line as I mentioned in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $370 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increased included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14% and we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined in the low teens. Asia-Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits and rest of the world declined high single digits. For the full year, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined high single digits. Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year, and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021. For both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation, while also delivering strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. Two-thirds of this was due to business and currency mix and a third due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the changing gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Moving on the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year R&D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year. Looking at results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income/expense was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense of the net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is a 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchase $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were $393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion. Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we\u2019re generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment margins. We\u2019re executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we\u2019re referring to the acquired PPD business as our Clinical Research business, and that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27%, and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation and testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4 we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. A strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by a healthcare market channel and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business. PPD at Clinical Research business continued to perform very well, and during the quarter it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021. Let me turn to our 2023 guidance. As Marc outlined, we\u2019re starting the year with a very strong financial outlook consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details to the underlying assumptions starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%. Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we\u2019re expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we\u2019re managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy. Turning to profitability, in 2023, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by two elements, a 40 basis points of core margin expansion and a 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I have made on the last earnings call were not [ph] described have to model a margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue. In 2023 with a pandemic related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multi-year view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. Starting in 2019, pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we\u2019re on track to expand operating margins, 60 basis points a year on average through 2023 and 250 basis point improvement over the full year period. It\u2019s a great progress on margin expansion. Turning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase consisting of a 10% headwind from testing more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We\u2019re actively managing the whole P&L to effectively deal with material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue, and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI business system. Moving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX in 2023, we\u2019re assuming it\u2019s a year-over-year tailwind of approximately a $100 million of revenue or 0.2% and $0.04 to adjusted EPS also 0.2%. We\u2019re assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for the Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion for share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count were approximately 388 million shares. We\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1 and the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year. From a foreign exchange standpoint while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and interest on that cash build. Putting all this together for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total. So to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022 and we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone lines comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to start with the clinical research, PPD, performance. So high teens for the year, that's well above what we're seeing from the pure group, so a three-parter for you, Marc. What was your book-to-bill in 2022? Two, how are the revenue synergies tracking? And then three, can you talk about what sort of growth you're assuming for this business in 2023?\nMarc Casper: Sure. So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research group has performed incredibly well, a great first year as part of the company, exceeding our own high level of ambition for the business. Integration has gone smoothly. Customers really see the obvious fit with the company, and it really has driven very strong momentum. And our colleagues are very excited about the combination. So as I think about the different elements of performance, the book-to-bill was very positive. Authorizations were very strong in the quarter and the year. So we entered the year with very strong momentum in terms of the backlog that we have in the business and the authorizations. The revenue synergies, the way I would think about it is in two phases because of the long-cycle nature from a win to revenue. We've won extremely substantial revenue synergies that will show up in the financials in 2023 and beyond. We had a small amount of revenue that came into the numbers last year, but we're talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars of wins that we've achieved from an authorization standpoint, so extremely positive. And in terms of our thoughts about 2023, it will grow above of the company's average of the 7% growth that we outlined in the course. So a nice contributor to the success. And really, it's been a seamless integration for the team. We're very grateful for that.\nJack Meehan: Excellent. And then I wanted to ask about the COVID vaccines and therapeutics. So you're assuming $500 million for the year. My question is simple. Just how core are your core sales? Would you ever consider changing this definition? Just confidence in the handoff as it pertains to bioprocessing in 2023?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. But when I think about the $500 million, right, and when I look at that, that number is primarily related to our pharma services activity. It's around actually producing the active pharmaceutical ingredients for the therapies. It's for the sterile fill finish primarily for the vaccines and some of the therapies. So we have pretty good visibility to that number. So I feel good about that. We decided back, I guess, 1.5 years ago or whatever the exact timeframe we did, the definition of core was we invested in capacity. And if you think about a sterile fill finish line, as an example, can be used for a COVID vaccine. It can also be used for pretty much any other biologic and even some of the small molecules, right? And therefore, our view was we would transition that capacity over time and we have been and we will. The other aspect of core is that if you think about how strong our growth was last year, well above our own ambitions. Even the 12% we had laid out at the end of the third quarter, we've already transitioned a meaningful amount of that revenue in terms of other activities. So we didn't contemplate at all about changing the definition of what success is. We think 7% is the right number for us. The core is the right definition for us. We'll provide transparency during the year about the different components as we always do, so that investors can understand how we're getting there. But I feel great about the outlook, and I'm very proud of what the team delivered last year. Thanks, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Excellent, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Marc, maybe one on the Analytical Instruments business, 14% growth for the year is obviously pretty impressive. You guys have seen elevated growth for a good stretch here. It did step down a little bit against an easier comp. So I just wanted to get more color, I guess, on what you're seeing on the demand side, how you're seeing order trends and bookings there, visibility into 2023. I know you've had this elevated backlog we've talked a lot about. It seems like some peers are expecting kind of a normalization or moderation in the second half as we work our way through the year. So I want to get your perspective of what you're seeing there.\nMarc Casper: Yes. Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the Analytical Instruments business, a really strong year, excellent execution. There's nothing different in Q4 than in Q3. So I wouldn't read anything into that. When I look at what's driving it, last year, you saw good market conditions. Funding was clearly strong. I don't know if there was a little bit of pent-up demand from 2020, I don't know. But the funding was clearly available. We did very well with our innovation, right? We stayed committed to innovation throughout the early phase of the pandemic, making sure we have robust pipelines. You saw that in the stream of launches in our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses, those products have been well adopted. We're clearly growing very well. And as you know, we've also built out a very strong presence in enabling the next generation of semiconductors, battery applications. The most advanced aspects of material science is a different market position than really anybody else has in the industry and that's driving great growth, right? And you can see it in our electron microscopy numbers. I'm very proud of how the team has executed. So, that's kind of the context of why the elevated growth. So as I think about bookings demand, very strong throughout the year. So we have good visibility to the first half. It's when those \u2013 most of those orders will ship. We would expect that the Analytical Instruments business will be a really nice contributor to our growth for the year. And I think it's reasonable to assume that the growth normalizes more in the second half as an assumption. It's not that I see something different or something happening in the market conditions, but our visibility is typically six months. So at the end of the first quarter, we'll have good visibility into the third quarter, and we'll keep you posted. But I think for modeling purpose, I think, normalization in the second half is a good assumption.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one for Stephen on the margins. Gross margins seem to have rebased. I would love just your perspective of what those look like in 2023, first off. And then maybe just the additional areas of leverage kind of down the P&L coming out of COVID, you mentioned maybe some elevated strategic investments in 2022.  Obviously, we saw some things like one-time bonuses that are pretty clear. But it would be helpful if you could just talk through the moving pieces, what areas of additional leverage you do have coming out of 2022. Because again, the mix, obviously as LPS becomes bigger, the margins should going to be lower, but you guys are putting up a pretty good number. So just trying to figure out, again, a little bit of the moving pieces and areas of leverage you have when you think about that 23.9% for 2023.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin profile going forward, that 7% to 9% core organic growth driving 40 to 50 basis points is the right way to think about that company. And the margin opportunity there, you got a little bit of \u2013 that just seems a little bit of price benefit, good volume leverage that comes with that and still investing in the business to maintain that top line growth. And then a continuation of using PPIs, that kind of decomplex the company, but I think that \u2013 that margin profile still holds in terms of going from the 23.9% going forward, post 2023, I think about the levers that we have. As you saw in this past year, we had a slightly different mix like higher growth in certain parts of our business. And certainly, margins were slightly different in Q4 than we had in the prior guide. But the revenue is significantly higher. And what really matters is operating income dollars that we're driving, and that's incredibly strong and I think that margin profile and then the mix then holds into 2023. And then therefore that kind of 7% to 9% driving that 40 to 50 is a good way to model the company.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then just gross margins for 2023, if you have it?\nStephen Williamson: I don't really want to give guidance to every single element of the P&L. It's \u2013 we're trying to manage a complex company, but a similar margin profile to where we are right now is probably a good starting point. But it really depends on the mix and also changes in currency, and our job is to manage the whole thing and deliver great results.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks, very helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Okay, thanks, operator. So first up, just on China. China declined mid-single digits during 4Q, and you say that some of that was testing roll-off. You also talked about how China is part of the reason that that core \u2013 core growth is going to ramp throughout the year. So can you just walk us through what are you embedding for China growth for 1Q and then for total 2023? And then can you also just spend a minute talking about the underlying demand trends for China and how you plan into the reopening trade?\nMarc Casper: Rachel, thanks for the question. So if I step at the highest level with China, right, historically, been our fastest growing end market. We have a very strong position. Our enabling technologies are important to life sciences and food safety and the biologics industry in China, et cetera. So good demand drivers long-term, long historical perspective. When I think about last year, team delivered high single-digit growth for the year. When I think about the fourth quarter, you had very, very significant disruptions from the end of the COVID, zero COVID policies, right? So you went from this period where I think at least we had no problem in navigating through the challenges of the lockdown policies. But when you have 50%, 60%, 70% of colleagues with COVID, that's obviously highly disruptive. And so you saw the first half of the quarter was strong. The second half of the quarter was weak. Our assumption for this year is that the zero COVID, opening up the economy leads to a weaker first quarter, a strong rebound in the balance of the year. China will grow on our expectations in our guidance a little bit faster for the full year than our core growth. So that's how I would think about it. So a really strong end market, including the disruption from Q1. I think the team has done actually \u2013 I'm very impressed with how they've dealt with all of the complexities and keeping our colleagues safe. It's been a challenging period of time.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then maybe just kind of digging deeper on Patrick's question around margins. So you did 22.4% adjusted op ms for 4Q. You guided to a step down on that operating margin line during 1Q, but then hitting that 23.9%-ish for the year for 2023. So can you just kind of bridge us through the math there on margins and how that gives you confidence in the back half of the year to be able to round out at just shy of 24%?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, Rachel, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin progression through the year, Q1, we got a very significant roll-off in highly profitable testing revenue. And the cost actions against that to enable a 40% pull-through for the year, it's a combination of cost actions and then a non-repeat of the cost \u2013 of certain one-time things that we were doing on compensation in the prior year. Those things spread over the whole year. So you get a little bit of benefit in Q1 to offset part of that profitability, but more of that offset really coming in the following three quarters. So that's really the largest piece to it. Now FX is a headwind to margins in Q1, so that's a slight aspect to it. And then the phasing of the China activity is another aspect of that kind of lower level of activity in Q1 and then ramping up to a higher level of revenue in Q4.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Helpful. And then maybe just squeezing one more in here on industrial and applied, you grew low teens in 4Q. So can you just give us a little bit more granularity on that performance during the quarter, if there is any pockets of outpaced strength or softness relative to your expectations? And then how are you thinking about that industrial and applied market for 2023, given the macro backdrop, and is there any conservatism there in the assumed guidance? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes, so industrial and applied was very strong in the quarter. Low teens growth in the quarter. Really strong demand and shipments for our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy business. So we didn\u2019t see any concerns. Our assumption for the year is that just going to grow at about the average rate growth for the full year. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming in the guidance.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you.\nMarcCasper: Thanks, Rachel.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nDerik de Bruin: Hello, and good morning. So\u2026\nMarc Casper: Good morning, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Stephen not \u2013 is not to pick on the margin point, but I do want to sort of clarify something. I mean, I \u2013 looking at the 40 basis points to 50 basis points of expansion. So let\u2019s say you do a 100 next couple of years. I mean, at your Analyst Day in May, you talked about a 26 percent-ish adjusted operating margin, excluding the impact of capital deployment. Or I mean, can you sort of just walk us through sort of like how you\u2019re thinking about the 2025 outlook that you provided and sort of like general thoughts around that and then there? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Go ahead, Stephen.\nStephen Williamson: Yes, when I think about margin profile, it\u2019s in combination with revenue dollars. So our revenue dollars are materially higher than we then incorporated into my long-term model. And a combination of that plus the margin gets you to a very strong operating income dollars, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving EPS. So I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re well positioned with the long-term model.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. That\u2019s what I thought I just wanted to clarify that as well. And then just one quick follow-up. I assume there\u2019s some residual COVID business in your PPD. You talked about core growth being 20%. What is the headwind in the PPD business from leftover COVID going from 2023 to \u2013 2022 to 2023?\nMarc Casper: Yes, there\u2019s some activity of studies that will roll off over multiple years in terms of required follow on studies and activity there that the team as those studies come off, they just have moved to other areas of the therapeutic range. So that really has been done quite seamlessly. And as you know, with the business scaling the way it is having a large capable team is a great way to be able to be ready to serve the next set of customer work. So pretty straightforward.\nDerik de Bruin: And so if I can \u2013 also can I squeeze one more in CapEx sort of outlook as we go from 2023, and you have been adding a lot of facilities, can you sort of talk about what you\u2019re thinking about 2023, 2024?\nMarc Casper: So 2023, Stephen said it\u2019s a couple billion dollars and we\u2019ll continue to \u2013 it will kind of go down to a glide path back to that 3.5% \u2013 3% to 3.5% from over time. So nothing\u2019s changed in that assumption.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Derik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Your line is now open Dan.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you. Maybe Marc to kick it off, just I\u2019m all in on Aaron Rodgers if the Jets can get him. That\u2019d be like a struggling company getting \u2013 that\u2019d be like a struggling company getting you as a CEO would be a great deal I think so. So that\u2019s one of my questions here. Maybe the first one, just obviously, there\u2019s a lot of concerns in the industry broadly on the near-term drag on revenue growth for biologic drug products. Given the inventory, depletion that\u2019s ongoing in the industry, you\u2019ve been pretty confident that for various reasons, Thermo is really not seeing this. Just would be interesting to get an update on kind of just on your thinking there and kind of what you\u2019re assuming in your outlook for 7% growth for your businesses both on the consumable side and on the Patheon services side?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so in terms of football, Hope Springs Eternal until the first snap. In terms of the bioproduction business what I would say is a few points. Obviously not every single player has reported, but a couple of them have. So we have a sense of how the industry did and what others have said. When I think about last year, our bioproduction business just crushed it again, right? It just phenomenal performance well above the rate of growth of our pharma and biotech customer set. And that\u2019s three years in a row of really very strong growth. Very proud of how the team has executed. When I think about 2023 against tougher comparisons, obviously, the growth will normalize a bit. And I would expect that based on some of the COVID comparisons of the first half of 2022, that you\u2019ll see more normalization in the first half, stronger in the second half is the pattern, but it\u2019s a good business with incredibly bright prospects. So from that perspective, I feel good about how the team\u2019s managing it, what the \u2013 what 2023 will contribute and what the long term is going to be fantastic. Pharma Services businesses has had a very good year, very strong growth, has brought its capacity online very effectively and winning a lot of new business. We still have activity this year that\u2019s meaningful in the vaccine therapies for COVID. And then as those wind down at some point in time, it\u2019s hard to know what the longer-term visibility is for that capacity just gets repurposed on the thing. So we do that in an orderly fashion. So that\u2019s how I think about it. But a really strong year and some really nice meaningful wins throughout 2022 that sets up the Pharma Services business [indiscernible].\nDan Brennan: Got it. And then \u2013 and maybe this is a follow-up. Obviously, your business mix is a lot less cyclical today than it was back in the prior downturn. I\u2019m just wondering implicit in the seven, and Rachel asked the question on industrial business. But just to what extent does your guide bacon some cushion for potential slowdown that could unfold given weaker macro?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so what we assumed is normal market conditions, right? And if the way I would characterize last year was above normal market conditions. So normal in my definition is marked goes 4% to 6%, right? And we said that for a very, very long time. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming for this year. If it\u2019s materially different than that, meaning that if the market conditions look anything like they look last year, we\u2019re going to grow well above the core guidance. If the market conditions are meaningfully worse, then what\u2019s assumed the normal market conditions, then we\u2019re going to grow lower than the core organic that we outlined. So nothing\u2019s dramatic about that. And we\u2019ll be super transparent and all our investors will understand if the world is totally different than what it looks like on February 1. What we know is that we\u2019re going to manage incredibly well. So whatever the world throws at us will come out with great short-term performance and a much stronger industry leader for the long term. And that\u2019s what\u2019s super cool about Thermo Fisher because it\u2019s our job to manage the dynamics and do it great and do a great job for our investors. So I\u2019m excited for what the world upholds in 2023 and beyond.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Dan. We now have Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong finish with the year and thanks for taking my question. I had two parts. Maybe I\u2019ll ask them both upfront. Marc, the first part for you on when I look at this guidance and base organic excluding vaccine, I think the business did \u2013 the business is assuming perhaps low double-digit organic here in fiscal 2023 in that coming off of perhaps a mid-teens comp. One is that math correct that base business excluding vaccine double digit? And what is it assuming? I\u2019m assuming \u2013 I\u2019m thinking biopharma has to grow at least mid-teens to get to the 9% to 10%. And it seems pretty strong. Do those numbers make sense? And Stephen, the second part for you on margins here, what are you assuming for decremental margins on COVID and margins in FX? And did I hear you correctly on Q1 is starting at 22%, just wanted to make sure I heard the numbers right.\nMarc Casper: Sure. So in terms of the guidance and the 7% core, we did not do a lot of machinations about excluding this or that. I think from the math, the way you\u2019re doing it is that if you excluded the vaccines and therapies, it would imply that the growth was 9% or 10%, somewhere in that range is about what the growth would be on that measure of which we\u2019re not using that particular measure. Therefore, you can\u2019t sort of speculate on sort what all the dynamics, it\u2019s much better to just say relative to our 7% grow pharma and biotech, we expect to grow above that, right, in terms of its contribution to the 7%. And we would assume that the industrial and applied would go around the 7% core and the other two markets are a little bit below. So that\u2019s how you should think about the different dynamics.\nStephen Williamson: Yes, Vijay in terms of the pull through on the lower testing revenue, as I outlined in the last quarter, the assumptions are approximately 40% in aggregate for the whole year. But that doesn\u2019t all \u2013 that\u2019s not the same in every single quarter. Like the offsetting cost actions against a very significant profitability pull through, which is higher than that on a contribution margin basis that\u2019s spread across each of the quarters. But the revenue drop is largely just in Q1. So that\u2019s why you have the margin profile that I outlined for Q1. And the indication I gave for Q1 margin profile at this point is slightly below what has the margin in Q4. So the largest driver there is that a large drop in very profitable testing, and then the offset on the costs to get it to the 40% pull through spread throughout the year. Thanks, Vijay.\nMarc Casper: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nDan Arias: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Marc, maybe just one on bioprocess, bioproduction. I just wanted to ask whether you\u2019re seeing any differences in purchasing patterns and the way that inventories just appear as though they\u2019re being managed when you look at CDMOs versus the biopharmas themselves. There has been some conversation around just timelines that look like they might materialize on destocking. So curious if you can just sort of help us what might be taking place given where you sit here?\nMarc Casper: Yes, that\u2019s sort of along the line [indiscernible] question, really not much to add, right, which is phenomenal 2022. We created a really challenging and exciting comparison. We get paid to create those comparisons and I would expect that would show up in a more normalized growth in the first half and a little bit stronger than that in the second half. And I think there\u2019s much color between the different customer types or that would provide much more insight on it.\nDan Arias: Okay. Thanks so much.\nMarc Casper: Welcome. So let me wrap it up here. Thanks everyone for participating in the call. With another strong year behind us, we\u2019re in a great position to achieve another excellent year in 2023. And as always, thank you for support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we look forward to updating you during the course of the year as it progresses. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today\u2019s call. Please have a lovely day and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year. For the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year. Taking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year. That's a great accomplishment. Then using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year. Let me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year. On the top line as I mentioned in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $370 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increased included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14% and we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined in the low teens. Asia-Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits and rest of the world declined high single digits. For the full year, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined high single digits. Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year, and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021. For both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation, while also delivering strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. Two-thirds of this was due to business and currency mix and a third due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the changing gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Moving on the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year R&D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year. Looking at results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income/expense was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense of the net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is a 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchase $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were $393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion. Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment margins. We're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our Clinical Research business, and that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27%, and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation and testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4 we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. A strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by a healthcare market channel and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business. PPD at Clinical Research business continued to perform very well, and during the quarter it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021. Let me turn to our 2023 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're starting the year with a very strong financial outlook consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details to the underlying assumptions starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%. Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we're expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we're managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy. Turning to profitability, in 2023, we're assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by two elements, a 40 basis points of core margin expansion and a 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I have made on the last earnings call were not [ph] described have to model a margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue. In 2023 with a pandemic related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multi-year view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. Starting in 2019, pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we're on track to expand operating margins, 60 basis points a year on average through 2023 and 250 basis point improvement over the full year period. It's a great progress on margin expansion. Turning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase consisting of a 10% headwind from testing more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We're actively managing the whole P&L to effectively deal with material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue, and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI business system. Moving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX in 2023, we're assuming it's a year-over-year tailwind of approximately a $100 million of revenue or 0.2% and $0.04 to adjusted EPS also 0.2%. We're assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for the Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We're expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion for share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count were approximately 388 million shares. We're assuming that we're return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1 and the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year. From a foreign exchange standpoint while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and interest on that cash build. Putting all this together for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total. So to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022 and we're really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin profile going forward, that 7% to 9% core organic growth driving 40 to 50 basis points is the right way to think about that company. And the margin opportunity there, you got a little bit of \u2013 that just seems a little bit of price benefit, good volume leverage that comes with that and still investing in the business to maintain that top line growth. And then a continuation of using PPIs, that kind of decomplex the company, but I think that \u2013 that margin profile still holds in terms of going from the 23.9% going forward, post 2023, I think about the levers that we have. As you saw in this past year, we had a slightly different mix like higher growth in certain parts of our business. And certainly, margins were slightly different in Q4 than we had in the prior guide. But the revenue is significantly higher. And what really matters is operating income dollars that we're driving, and that's incredibly strong and I think that margin profile and then the mix then holds into 2023. And then therefore that kind of 7% to 9% driving that 40 to 50 is a good way to model the company. I don't really want to give guidance to every single element of the P&L. It's \u2013 we're trying to manage a complex company, but a similar margin profile to where we are right now is probably a good starting point. But it really depends on the mix and also changes in currency, and our job is to manage the whole thing and deliver great results. Yes. So, Rachel, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin progression through the year, Q1, we got a very significant roll-off in highly profitable testing revenue. And the cost actions against that to enable a 40% pull-through for the year, it's a combination of cost actions and then a non-repeat of the cost \u2013 of certain one-time things that we were doing on compensation in the prior year. Those things spread over the whole year. So you get a little bit of benefit in Q1 to offset part of that profitability, but more of that offset really coming in the following three quarters. So that's really the largest piece to it. Now FX is a headwind to margins in Q1, so that's a slight aspect to it. And then the phasing of the China activity is another aspect of that kind of lower level of activity in Q1 and then ramping up to a higher level of revenue in Q4. Yes, when I think about margin profile, it's in combination with revenue dollars. So our revenue dollars are materially higher than we then incorporated into my long-term model. And a combination of that plus the margin gets you to a very strong operating income dollars, and that's what's driving EPS. So I'm \u2013 we're well positioned with the long-term model. Yes, Vijay in terms of the pull through on the lower testing revenue, as I outlined in the last quarter, the assumptions are approximately 40% in aggregate for the whole year. But that doesn't all \u2013 that's not the same in every single quarter. Like the offsetting cost actions against a very significant profitability pull through, which is higher than that on a contribution margin basis that's spread across each of the quarters. But the revenue drop is largely just in Q1. So that's why you have the margin profile that I outlined for Q1. And the indication I gave for Q1 margin profile at this point is slightly below what has the margin in Q4. So the largest driver there is that a large drop in very profitable testing, and then the offset on the costs to get it to the 40% pull through spread throughout the year. Thanks, Vijay."

            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals. Our ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world. I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivers spectacular 2022, and I couldn't be more excited for 2023. I'll get into more of the details in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share. Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets. We continue to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech, we continue to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel.  In industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. And finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our healthcare market channel. I'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering the differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights. In 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In electron microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations. We also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease. During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA sequencing system was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma. This is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in life sciences solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TruMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens. To wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs. So another spectacular year of innovation, and we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year, and I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities. We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development. As always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution. We continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share. The combination of a great first year performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine. In 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of the Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders. Reflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability roadmap, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transitions towards a 100% renewable energy. Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade. Through our Foundation for Science, we continue to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S. And throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher, and I'm excited about 2023 and beyond. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2022, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we entered 2023 with strong momentum and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Sure. So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research group has performed incredibly well, a great first year as part of the company, exceeding our own high level of ambition for the business. Integration has gone smoothly. Customers really see the obvious fit with the company, and it really has driven very strong momentum. And our colleagues are very excited about the combination. So as I think about the different elements of performance, the book-to-bill was very positive. Authorizations were very strong in the quarter and the year. So we entered the year with very strong momentum in terms of the backlog that we have in the business and the authorizations. The revenue synergies, the way I would think about it is in two phases because of the long-cycle nature from a win to revenue. We've won extremely substantial revenue synergies that will show up in the financials in 2023 and beyond. We had a small amount of revenue that came into the numbers last year, but we're talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars of wins that we've achieved from an authorization standpoint, so extremely positive. And in terms of our thoughts about 2023, it will grow above of the company's average of the 7% growth that we outlined in the course. So a nice contributor to the success. And really, it's been a seamless integration for the team. We're very grateful for that. Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. But when I think about the $500 million, right, and when I look at that, that number is primarily related to our pharma services activity. It's around actually producing the active pharmaceutical ingredients for the therapies. It's for the sterile fill finish primarily for the vaccines and some of the therapies. So we have pretty good visibility to that number. So I feel good about that. We decided back, I guess, 1.5 years ago or whatever the exact timeframe we did, the definition of core was we invested in capacity. And if you think about a sterile fill finish line, as an example, can be used for a COVID vaccine. It can also be used for pretty much any other biologic and even some of the small molecules, right? And therefore, our view was we would transition that capacity over time and we have been and we will. The other aspect of core is that if you think about how strong our growth was last year, well above our own ambitions. Even the 12% we had laid out at the end of the third quarter, we've already transitioned a meaningful amount of that revenue in terms of other activities. So we didn't contemplate at all about changing the definition of what success is. We think 7% is the right number for us. The core is the right definition for us. We'll provide transparency during the year about the different components as we always do, so that investors can understand how we're getting there. But I feel great about the outlook, and I'm very proud of what the team delivered last year. Thanks, Jack. Yes. Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the Analytical Instruments business, a really strong year, excellent execution. There's nothing different in Q4 than in Q3. So I wouldn't read anything into that. When I look at what's driving it, last year, you saw good market conditions. Funding was clearly strong. I don't know if there was a little bit of pent-up demand from 2020, I don't know. But the funding was clearly available. We did very well with our innovation, right? We stayed committed to innovation throughout the early phase of the pandemic, making sure we have robust pipelines. You saw that in the stream of launches in our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses, those products have been well adopted. We're clearly growing very well. And as you know, we've also built out a very strong presence in enabling the next generation of semiconductors, battery applications. The most advanced aspects of material science is a different market position than really anybody else has in the industry and that's driving great growth, right? And you can see it in our electron microscopy numbers. I'm very proud of how the team has executed. So, that's kind of the context of why the elevated growth. So as I think about bookings demand, very strong throughout the year. So we have good visibility to the first half. It's when those \u2013 most of those orders will ship. We would expect that the Analytical Instruments business will be a really nice contributor to our growth for the year. And I think it's reasonable to assume that the growth normalizes more in the second half as an assumption. It's not that I see something different or something happening in the market conditions, but our visibility is typically six months. So at the end of the first quarter, we'll have good visibility into the third quarter, and we'll keep you posted. But I think for modeling purpose, I think, normalization in the second half is a good assumption. Rachel, thanks for the question. So if I step at the highest level with China, right, historically, been our fastest growing end market. We have a very strong position. Our enabling technologies are important to life sciences and food safety and the biologics industry in China, et cetera. So good demand drivers long-term, long historical perspective. When I think about last year, team delivered high single-digit growth for the year. When I think about the fourth quarter, you had very, very significant disruptions from the end of the COVID, zero COVID policies, right? So you went from this period where I think at least we had no problem in navigating through the challenges of the lockdown policies. But when you have 50%, 60%, 70% of colleagues with COVID, that's obviously highly disruptive. And so you saw the first half of the quarter was strong. The second half of the quarter was weak. Our assumption for this year is that the zero COVID, opening up the economy leads to a weaker first quarter, a strong rebound in the balance of the year. China will grow on our expectations in our guidance a little bit faster for the full year than our core growth. So that's how I would think about it. So a really strong end market, including the disruption from Q1. I think the team has done actually \u2013 I'm very impressed with how they've dealt with all of the complexities and keeping our colleagues safe. It's been a challenging period of time. Yes, so industrial and applied was very strong in the quarter. Low teens growth in the quarter. Really strong demand and shipments for our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy business. So we didn't see any concerns. Our assumption for the year is that just going to grow at about the average rate growth for the full year. So that's what we're assuming in the guidance. Thanks, Rachel. Good morning, Derik. Go ahead, Stephen. Yes, there's some activity of studies that will roll off over multiple years in terms of required follow on studies and activity there that the team as those studies come off, they just have moved to other areas of the therapeutic range. So that really has been done quite seamlessly. And as you know, with the business scaling the way it is having a large capable team is a great way to be able to be ready to serve the next set of customer work. So pretty straightforward. So 2023, Stephen said it's a couple billion dollars and we'll continue to \u2013 it will kind of go down to a glide path back to that 3.5% \u2013 3% to 3.5% from over time. So nothing's changed in that assumption. Thanks, Derik. Yes, so in terms of football, Hope Springs Eternal until the first snap. In terms of the bioproduction business what I would say is a few points. Obviously not every single player has reported, but a couple of them have. So we have a sense of how the industry did and what others have said. When I think about last year, our bioproduction business just crushed it again, right? It just phenomenal performance well above the rate of growth of our pharma and biotech customer set. And that's three years in a row of really very strong growth. Very proud of how the team has executed. When I think about 2023 against tougher comparisons, obviously, the growth will normalize a bit. And I would expect that based on some of the COVID comparisons of the first half of 2022, that you'll see more normalization in the first half, stronger in the second half is the pattern, but it's a good business with incredibly bright prospects. So from that perspective, I feel good about how the team's managing it, what the \u2013 what 2023 will contribute and what the long term is going to be fantastic. Pharma Services businesses has had a very good year, very strong growth, has brought its capacity online very effectively and winning a lot of new business. We still have activity this year that's meaningful in the vaccine therapies for COVID. And then as those wind down at some point in time, it's hard to know what the longer-term visibility is for that capacity just gets repurposed on the thing. So we do that in an orderly fashion. So that's how I think about it. But a really strong year and some really nice meaningful wins throughout 2022 that sets up the Pharma Services business [indiscernible]. Yes, so what we assumed is normal market conditions, right? And if the way I would characterize last year was above normal market conditions. So normal in my definition is marked goes 4% to 6%, right? And we said that for a very, very long time. So that's what we're assuming for this year. If it's materially different than that, meaning that if the market conditions look anything like they look last year, we're going to grow well above the core guidance. If the market conditions are meaningfully worse, then what's assumed the normal market conditions, then we're going to grow lower than the core organic that we outlined. So nothing's dramatic about that. And we'll be super transparent and all our investors will understand if the world is totally different than what it looks like on February 1. What we know is that we're going to manage incredibly well. So whatever the world throws at us will come out with great short-term performance and a much stronger industry leader for the long term. And that's what's super cool about Thermo Fisher because it's our job to manage the dynamics and do it great and do a great job for our investors. So I'm excited for what the world upholds in 2023 and beyond. Sure. So in terms of the guidance and the 7% core, we did not do a lot of machinations about excluding this or that. I think from the math, the way you're doing it is that if you excluded the vaccines and therapies, it would imply that the growth was 9% or 10%, somewhere in that range is about what the growth would be on that measure of which we're not using that particular measure. Therefore, you can't sort of speculate on sort what all the dynamics, it's much better to just say relative to our 7% grow pharma and biotech, we expect to grow above that, right, in terms of its contribution to the 7%. And we would assume that the industrial and applied would go around the 7% core and the other two markets are a little bit below. So that's how you should think about the different dynamics. Operator, we have time for one more question. Yes, that's sort of along the line [indiscernible] question, really not much to add, right, which is phenomenal 2022. We created a really challenging and exciting comparison. We get paid to create those comparisons and I would expect that would show up in a more normalized growth in the first half and a little bit stronger than that in the second half. And I think there's much color between the different customer types or that would provide much more insight on it. Welcome. So let me wrap it up here. Thanks everyone for participating in the call. With another strong year behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another excellent year in 2023. And as always, thank you for support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we look forward to updating you during the course of the year as it progresses. Thanks, everyone."

So with that, I will now turn over the call to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing incredibly well and demonstrating broad-based strength and this is allowing us to raise our guidance once again for the full year. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I am very proud of our team\u2019s great execution, effectively navigating dynamic times and continuing to drive market share gains. Our ongoing success is driven by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System and I will talk about that more later. So let me recap the Q3 financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.68 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.08 per share. Turning to our end markets, as we saw in the second quarter, we had a continuation of strong performance in Q3. This was driven by good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some additional color. Starting with pharma and biotech, we delivered outstanding performance with growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across the businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Our differentiated customer value proposition is resonating with our customers and helping to further elevate our trusted partner status. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in our biosciences and electron microscopy businesses. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the high-teens for the quarter. We have broad-based strength across all of our analytical instrument businesses serving these customers. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, as expected, our revenue was approximately 30% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, we delivered good core business growth led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. So now let me turn to our growth strategy, which has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. The investments we have made over the past few years are fueling growth and generating strong returns. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me start with innovation. Our focus on high-impact innovation enables our customers to address some of the world\u2019s greatest challenges. We further strengthened our position in Q3 and I\u2019d like to give you just a few highlights. During the quarter, we advanced our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer during the International Mass Spectrometry Conference. This instrument provides faster, more sensitive sample analysis for proteomics and metabolomics research and insights into clinically relevant biomarkers implicated in cancer. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. This instrument will help provide more insights into how proteins and other molecules operate within cells, enabling breakthroughs in treatments for infectious diseases and neurogenerative disorders. We also continue to advance our clinical next-gen sequencing portfolio to help our customers better understand, diagnose and treat cancer. We recently launched the Oncomine Dx Express Test and Oncomine Reporter Dx software, a precision medicine offering which detects genomic abnormalities in tumor samples and helps match cancer patients with approved therapies and clinical trials. These products recently received CE-IVD certification and are designed to run on our Ion Torrent Genexus next-generation sequencing system, allowing doctors to use NGS technology to improve care by bringing the power of precision medicine closer to patients. Another key pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. It\u2019s all about leveraging the incredible capabilities we have across our company and delivering them in a way that enables our customers to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity and that makes it rational for them to do more business with us. The accelerated investments we have made over the past couple of years are driving growth. This is particularly true for our pharma and biotech customers, where we continue to build on our trusted partner status as we bring our new capacity and capabilities online to meet the strong demand for our products and services. Let me share a couple of examples. During the quarter, we opened a purification technologies facility in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. This site will manufacture resin beads used in the production of biologics. As you know, we have a rapidly growing purification business, which is highly valued by our customers. This new facility will ensure we can meet their increasing demand. We also continue to strengthen our global pharma services network, adding viral vector manufacturing capabilities in Plainville, Massachusetts. I joined the opening of this facility and it was a terrific event. We had significant attendance from our customers and we were able to showcase the various ways in which our team can support their cell and gene therapy programs. The facility also utilizes and showcases our industry-leading single-use bioprocessing technologies and analytical instruments, which demonstrates to our pharma and biotech customers the uniqueness of our capabilities and how they can best utilize in bringing new medicines to market. So, these are just a couple of examples that demonstrate how we are continuing to build our trusted partner status and further strengthen our unique customer value proposition. Our pharma biotech customers are capitalizing on this, which also includes PPD, our clinical research business. I will cover that later in my remarks. Before turning to an update on capital deployment, I thought I\u2019d briefly reflect on the impact of our growth strategy in 2022. As you know, the actions we have taken over the last 2 years have allowed us to meaningfully accelerate our organic growth and position us to continue our long-term industry leading performance. The product launches this year have been truly outstanding and the pipeline, it looks fantastic. The new capabilities that we have invested in have meaningfully strengthened our unique customer value proposition and our customers are continuing to expand their relationship with us. All of this is enabling us to deliver industry leading core growth. Let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. The acquisition of PPD is a great example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. The business is performing incredibly well, delivering high-teens core revenue growth in the quarter. The combination of a great business and a smooth integration is driving excellent financial performance. In addition, our customers are excited by the capabilities we have to support their clinical trial needs and that is translating into meaningful revenue synergies for an even brighter future. All of this is enabling us to drive short and long-term returns on the acquisition that are well ahead of the deal model. Let me spend a moment on our PPI Business System, which helps us continually improve the customer experience, quality, productivity in our company overall. The goal of PPI is to find a better way everyday. This is an essential element of our company culture. In dynamic times, we really see the strength of our PPI Business System. As you know, it was applied with incredible impact to allow us to lead the response to the pandemic. And today, it\u2019s applied to solve supply chain challenges, increase efficiency and helps our teams find better ways to offset inflation. It also enhances our ability to unlock the value creation in our acquisitions. Our experienced management team, along with the benefit of our scale and our PPI Business System, uniquely position the company to successfully navigate through whatever macroeconomic conditions come our way. So overall, it was another fantastic quarter, thanks to great execution by our teams, the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System. Turning to our progress on our environmental, social and governance priorities. During the quarter, we continued to make great progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, announcing an agreement with Enel North America to purchase wind power renewable electricity equal to half of our U.S. electricity needs. This agreement will significantly advance our ambitious emissions reduction strategy. I am also very pleased that we have achieved our 2020 commitment to hire 500 graduates from the historically black colleges and universities, supporting our commitment to diversity and inclusion and increasing our positive social impact, so another strong quarter in progressing our ESG priorities. Now, I\u2019d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion, which would result in 12% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and a modest impact of additional COVID-19 testing. These are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds and demonstrate how well we are operating with speed at scale to enable our customer success. In addition, our guidance reflects the decision to help our colleagues with the temporary impact of inflation. We will be making a one-time payment of approximately one week\u2019s additional salary to non-executive colleagues. So to summarize our key takeaways in the third quarter, our outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date reflect our team\u2019s excellent execution, the benefits of our proven growth strategy and the positive impact of our PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well and markets continue to be strong. We are gaining market share. We are seeing the benefits of our accelerated investments in innovative new products and enhanced capabilities and capacity. In addition, our clinical research business has delivered excellent results and customers are valuing the benefit of our expanded offering. And our experienced management team, the benefits of our scale and our PPI Business System uniquely position us to continue to navigate the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 again and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. This includes 14% core organic revenue growth from $5.08 of adjusted earnings per share. Revenue in Q3 was approximately $800 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance with just over $600 million driven by another quarter of extremely strong core organic growth, just over $200 million from additional COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by a small additional headwind from FX. So continue strengthening the core once again broad-based across businesses and end markets. In terms of adjusted EPS, our PPI Business System enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat. And after accruing $0.18 of additional compensation in the quarter to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation, we delivered $0.36 of adjusted EPS higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q3 was another quarter of excellent financial performance. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results and as I mentioned, we delivered $5.08 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.79. On the top line in Q3, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $440 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 14% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 1% lower organic revenue, a 20% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 5% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America grew in the low single-digits. Europe declined 10%. Asia-Pacific grew in the low single-digits with China growing high single-digits and rest of the world declined high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 760 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. The company\u2019s adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.7%, 970 basis points lower than Q3 last year. For the third quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. After factoring in the decision we took to accrue the additional colleague compensation that I mentioned earlier, both adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin came in as we had anticipated in our prior guidance. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points versus Q3 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million in Q3, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.7%. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $106 million. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.8%. This was 240 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The Q3 rate was 75 basis points lower than we assumed in the quarter in the prior guide due to the timing of discrete tax planning items between Q3 and Q4 with no net change for the year overall. Average diluted shares were 395 million in Q3, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $5.7 billion, and free cash flow was $4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and the year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and $29.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.1x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher than the prior year quarter but does skew some of the reported segment margins. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we outlined at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 20%, and organic revenue was 17% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 43%. And adjusted operating margin was 35.1%, down 14 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and the strategic investments that we\u2019re making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 10% in Q3, and organic growth was 16%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was broad-based led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 47%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, favorable business mix and strong productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue declined 22%, and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we saw a strong underlying growth in our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 29% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 21%, down 210 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered positive business mix and good productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volumes. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q3, reported revenue increased 60%. Organic growth was 12%, and the impact of acquisitions was 53%. During Q3, we had strong growth in the Pharma Services business as well as the research and safety market channel. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well. And during the quarter, we delivered high teens core organic growth and contributed $1.82 billion of revenue to the segment. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 89%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 200 basis points higher than Q3 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix, good productivity and also saw the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. As Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion. This includes a raise in the core organic growth outlook for the year from 11% to 12%. And on the bottom line, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The increase in the revenue guidance is driven by three elements: an increase of just over $600 million in the outlook for the core business, an increase of just over $200 million for COVID-19 testing revenue and a $200 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. From a core organic revenue perspective, the strength of our performance is enabling us to raise our full year core organic revenue growth outlook from 11% to 12%, and there is no change in the assumptions for core organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to COVID-19 testing revenue. We now expect $2.8 billion of testing revenue for the year, which includes the assumption of an endemic run rate level of $100 million per quarter in Q4. Our Q4 testing assumption has not changed from our previous guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, the $0.08 raise for the year consists of $0.54 of operational beat in Q3, partially offset by the decision to pay $180 million or $0.36 of additional one-time colleague compensation. And half of this is accrued in Q3, and the remainder will be in Q4. The full year guidance change also incorporates $0.10 lower EPS in Q4 for the additional FX headwind in the quarter and the revised phasing of our tax rate. All of this is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 from $22.93 to $23.01, further improving a very strong outlook for the year. From a margin standpoint, we now expect the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 24.9%. To help you with your modeling, I think it\u2019s worth spending a moment on the impact of the inflationary environment on the company\u2019s financial profile. During the year, we\u2019ve been very effective in passing on higher price to offset higher-than-normal inflation. This results in no net impact on our adjusted operating income dollars as we\u2019re effectively offsetting the added inflation, but it does affect the calculation of margins because of the revenue base being higher. The impact on margins for the full year from this dynamic is about 60 basis points, but again, no net impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS. So now let me provide you with some additional details on the updated 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business, is expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 14% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business. We now expect the business to contribute $2.03 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. In terms of FX, we\u2019ve incorporated current rates into our guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $1.46 billion on revenue or 3.7%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 is now expected to be $0.77 for the full year or 3.1%. Should FX rates stay the same as they are right now, we estimate the impact on FX in 2023 would be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1 billion on revenue and $0.75 on adjusted EPS. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $440 million in 2022. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, which includes a 13.6% tax rate in Q4. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. For free cash flow, we see $7 billion at the high end of the range of outcomes for the year. The actual free cash flow will depend on the year-end level of working capital. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance also continues to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And to conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. We\u2019re in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. So the big debate of the last week has been bioprocessing ordering and stocking trends. Marc, I was curious if you\u2019ve seen any normalization of ordering patterns from your customers. The quarterly growth, obviously strong, but how do you handicap the risk we could have an air pocket as COVID gets handed off to the quarter?\nMarc Casper: Jack, thanks for the question. So probably best to start one level up, and then I\u2019ll get to the details of it, right? When I think about pharma and biotech more broadly, right, it\u2019s our largest end market, represents about 60% of our business performing incredibly well, right? Mid-teens growth this quarter, mid-teens growth year-to-date. And that growth number actually doesn\u2019t include PPD, right, which is actually growing in the quarter, grew faster, right? So very strong, it\u2019s broad-based. Customer demand continues to be strong across the portfolio. All our businesses are performing very nicely. The long-term trends look very positive. And when I think back and I think because we live in a moment, if you go back the last 5 years, it actually averaged for this whole segment mid-teens growth, right? So it\u2019s not this year or this quarter. It\u2019s really been a long-term trend long before COVID, right? So very, very strong. Now so what\u2019s going on in bioproduction, right? There is obviously been a lot of commentary over the last week on the topic. And as a reminder, we have a leading presence to cell culture media, single-use technologies and actually quite a rapidly growing purification business. In aggregate, it\u2019s less than 10% of our total revenue. It\u2019s an awesome business, right? They performed very well in the quarter. It grew faster than the pharma and biotech average. The dynamics are very good, and we\u2019re very well positioned to deliver great growth going forward in serving our customer base.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then if you\u2019ll humor me, it\u2019s that time of year, everyone is thinking about 2023. So you sound very confident about your ability to outperform the market. But of course, the question is, how do you feel like the market is going to grow? So if you could just talk about how you\u2019re feeling about the healthy end markets. And any color you care to share around where you think you could land versus the 7% to 9% CAGR you\u2019ve laid out through 2025?\nMarc Casper: What I would say is if I think about where we are and think about the third quarter, right, it was a terrific quarter. If you look at the strength, right, that we had in terms of our core growth it\u2019s really broad-based, right? And you look at it and you say, alright, pharma and biotech that grew in the mid-teens. Industrial and applied, that grew in the high teens. Academic and government grew in the mid-single digits. And the core in healthcare and diagnostics, which is the indicator of what\u2019s going on in that end market, that actually was a mid-single-digit growth as well. So it\u2019s really very strong. So I like where we are at the 9 months. And in terms of exactly how we will be in \u201823, we will obviously talk about that in January in terms of what the outlook is. But certainly, at this point in the year, our end markets are strong, and our company\u2019s performance has been exceptional.\nJack Meehan: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning.\nMarc Casper: Good morning, Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: So to follow-up on Jack\u2019s question just because I\u2019m getting yelled at by investors. Can you talk a little bit more about the \u2013 just some of the impressions on \u201823? I think particularly, they just focus on margins, given how \u2013 sort of given how FX trends are going. I mean, it looks like, what, about a 4% FX to the top line next year and $0.75 on the bottom line. So is that \u2013 sort of should we think about if you\u2019re thinking about that 7% to 9%, maybe sort of in the 3%, 4% organic range all in next year, given the FX headwinds? And then just sort of talk a little bit more about like the margin setup for next year?\nMarc Casper: So I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m sure Stephen will chime in as well. So obviously, at a high level, we will get into this in January, right? Why do we do January is we will have the benefit of two things, which is where was the exact finish to the year, what\u2019s our jumping-off point? And second, what is the most close in view of the macro environment, right? So we will see how that plays out in January. But \u2013 excuse me. So if I go through the components, right? Obviously, the company is performing at an incredibly strong level. So that was very encouraging. As Stephen outlined, it will be a headwind that could change, obviously. But right now, we gave you that number so that you can at least update the models to reflect what current FX range rates are. And that\u2019s about $1 billion of revenue headwind and about $0.75 of adjusted EPS. The second one that I think is important, and it\u2019s an assumption, which is we\u2019re assuming in the fourth quarter that we\u2019re at an endemic level of COVID-19 testing. So that\u2019s $100 million of revenue in the quarter. And if that plays out in that way, then I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption per quarter for next year. So you\u2019re going to have the view on the COVID runoff down to the endemic rate on testing. And from the rest of the perspective, the business is in really good shape. And Stephen, you can comment on margins or anything else that I might have missed.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Derik, we look forward to giving you full details in 3 months\u2019 time in terms of the Q4 call. But think about the margin profile, there are different elements of the revenue, and think about how we model it in the long-term model for the company. 50 basis points of expansion on core essentially equates to about 30% pull-through on the margin profile and the revenue dollars increasing from a core standpoint. The FX headwind that we outlined on the call, that\u2019s also roughly a 30% margin pull-through. And on testing, it\u2019s a very profitable element of our business. And we factor in appropriately addressing the variable costs and the non-repeat of some of the colleague compensation one-time that we did this year. That pull-through on testing is \u2013 no, just 10% margin higher than the core. So, that will help you with modeling in terms around your own assumptions around the organic growth and testing and FX. And as I said, that\u2019s all incorporated in the long-term model. And then on the call, I called out that 60 basis points impact from the \u2013 added impact of added inflation and what we\u2019re doing on pricing and managing the company well to offset the impacts of the added inflation as more revenue to the company and negate the impact of the additional inflation. So, no net impact on operating income dollars. So when I think about all of that wrapped up for our long-term financial model we gave you back in May, we\u2019re on track to achieve or exceed the adjusted EPS target we put at that. We\u2019re managing very well through the dynamic times. Look forward to giving more details in \u201823 on the next call.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. Okay. I\u2019m still getting a bunch of questions from investors, but we will follow-up with it. But two other questions, just on this one. I guess are you still seeing like for like the $1.5 billion in COVID vaccines for this year? And just obviously some of the semiconductor companies have been hitting their CapEx numbers or cutting their CapEx numbers. Does that have any sort of like impact on sort of like your view on FEI and the instrument outlook? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Derik, in terms of vaccines and therapies, as a reminder, we said we would expect to do in our core revenue about $1.5 billion this year. We did just under $400 million in Q3. That brings the year-to-date to $1.3 billion and on track to achieve or exceed the $1.5 billion. So I feel good about that. Our \u2013 as a reminder, on electron microscopy, it\u2019s not correlated to the CapEx spend. It\u2019s correlated to R&D and new nodes and that business is performing incredibly well in terms of growth, with bookings all of the different metrics really doing incredibly well. Thank you, Derik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, maybe one just kind of following up on that stocking piece, I know you\u2019ve previously talked about Thermo, you guys are involved in a lot of the purchasing decisions of customers, have employees in the room. And you had previously seen some repurposing of the vaccine orders for other trial work as expected. So just, I guess, wondering specifically on the bioprocessing side kind of what your visibility is there? What you are seeing on stocking, and at times you said, if anything, maybe the inventory is actually running lean because you guys were capacity constrained. So I\u2019m just wondering kind of an update on that front?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question and a follow-up on that. So if I think about inventory, right, and I read some of the Q&A that happened last week. And somehow that translated into our own share price, which is a little bit of a head scratcher to me. If you think about inventory levels, right, I guess I always start at the high level. Three of our businesses, which are a large portion of the company, literally have nothing to do with inventory at all, right, which is pharma services, our clinical research business and our analytical instrument business has nothing to do with inventory. So I think it\u2019s important to remember that. The second, when you get down to the businesses that do have inventory levels, some of which we hold, some of which our customers hold, we do have really good visibility into it. And we help our customers appropriately manage those levels of inventory. I feel good about the position that we\u2019re in, alright? And for the couple of customers that might have COVID-related things, I\u2019m sure that they purchased a bit more because they had a high range of demand volatility that they were managing. But in terms of our bioproduction business, it grew well faster than pharma and biotech. The outlook is really strong, and I feel very well positioned going forward.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Stephen, I know you talked a little bit about the pricing dynamic kind of offsetting the inflation this year. It\u2019s obviously been a higher number, as you all know. How are you thinking about the \u201823 piece on pricing? Again, what\u2019s the expectation internally from Thermo on the inflation side? How are you going to kind of play the pricing side? Are you going to continue to raise as much? Is there a level where you kind of pull back a little bit and kind of value the customer relationships more? Maybe just talk through again the pricing piece. I know it\u2019s a little bit delicate with how high the inflation side is. So, be curious how you guys are thinking about that into next year. Thank you.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, have a better view on inflation three months\u2019 time, but we are effectively managing the dynamics now and expect to effectively manage them going forward. And this has been about pricing just if you can in an inflation environment. It\u2019s pricing appropriately, given the inflation dynamics and then bringing our customers along with us on that journey. So, I feel good about our ability to manage the dynamic going forward should the inflation levels remain at the elevated level.\nMarc Casper: And Patrick, the only thing I would add to that is when you think about how we describe the approach, right, we are not marking it up, right. We are driving substantial productivity. We are passing through an appropriate level of pricing to reflect real cost increase, and we are helping our customers through this period of time. And that\u2019s how we thought about it. And we think that\u2019s the right thing, given the importance of Thermo Fisher to our customers. And we will do an appropriate level of pricing based on the environment in \u201823 as we get into.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on solid top line this morning. Marc, one on fiscal \u201823 again, I know the guidance, the formal guidance is in January. But I guess the question is, the 7% to 9% LRP that Thermo issued at the Analyst Day, that\u2019s a CAGR. But there has been some nervousness that perhaps \u201823 could be below that range. I mean the macro is the macro. But ex macro in industrial, is there any sensitivity around these major drivers that would cause big deviation from the LRP range for \u201823 that we should be thinking about? Again, I am not asking for formal guidance, but any variables, qualitative comments we should be looking at?\nMarc Casper: So, Vijay, thanks for the question. So, when I think about how do we think about growth, right, is 7% to 9%. And if you take the long-term model, right. So, I am not commenting on \u201823. I don\u2019t make a comment there. But that\u2019s industry-leading, right. I think folks forget that. That\u2019s \u2013 that number is higher than anybody else has committed to in the industry. So, I feel great about that. And of course, we are the biggest company, so which makes it super cool, right, in terms of what that says about share gain, right. So, I think that sometimes is forgotten. We are not constraining ourselves to 7% to 9%, right. We are growing 12% this year, right. And the measure that we actually use is, are we doing a good job, right. I mean the 7% to 9% is assuming 4% to 6% market growth over the long period. The market growth is a little better than that. I feel great about our 12% performance. When we sit here at the end of 2022, what we do know is that our business will have been larger as a starting off point than what we assumed in the long-term model. So, right there, we have had more core growth that will offset some of the transition from vaccines and therapies that move into the other parts of core. So, we are super well positioned. And we will figure out is 7% to 9% the right number. That\u2019s kind of our default unless something is radically different as a starting point to a year. And obviously, if the conditions are super robust, it could be higher than that. If we are in a gale-force recession, it could be lower than that, right. But I think at this point in the year, the long-term is we are doing better on the top line. We are right on track on EPS and we are incredibly well positioned into 2023, and we will figure it out. And I don\u2019t think we are going to surprise anybody, right. We will all look at the macro and say, yes, those numbers make a ton of sense based on what the environment is as we sit here in January. And once again, we will be ambitious, and we will deliver great performance.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful, Marc. Maybe one for Stephen here, on the impact from additional comp, and I understand there is some flow-through in Q4. Stephen, when you think about \u201823, are you planning for any comp, incremental comp expenses to offset inflation for employees? Is that something that we should be considering?\nStephen Williamson: No, I think the dynamics that I outlined earlier on is going to pull through. The assumption there is that don\u2019t repeat. We will figure out what the current situation is during the year and make the right calls and manage the company appropriately. But when I think about that pull-through on the testing, that includes the non-repeat on those actions as well.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan, your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the questions. Marc, I don\u2019t want to jinx for jet, so I am going to refrain from making any comments or claims here. Maybe Marc and Steve, could you just walk us around the globe and your key end markets? I mean just speak to what extent you are seeing any impacts from the weakening global economy. And if nothing really manifest in Q3, which doesn\u2019t look like it has, are there any lead indicators like orders funnels, anything of that nature that might reflect some softening? Just \u2013 and then kind of connected to that, the fourth quarter guide does reflect a notable slowing on a stack comp basis. And so I am wondering if that\u2019s just conservatism or if that does incorporate some maybe risk from global macro?\nMarc Casper: So, in terms of the macroeconomic environment, beyond the inflationary impacts, which we had explained, actually, our end markets have been very strong. As you know, I gave you the cut by the four kind of customer sets, actually geographically, no particular pattern that jumps out as a concern. When you look at Europe, the core growth actually was 10% growth. So, Europe was actually strong. And it makes sense because you have a large pharma and biotech proportion of that. So, that was good. And our assumption is that in China, which will have a very good year and a good quarter, it\u2019s probably slightly lower than the long-term historical view. And that\u2019s mostly the COVID policies there. So, we are always looking for is there something lurking, but right now, things remain strong. Fourth quarter, it\u2019s the same assumptions that we have been using all year, which is we haven\u2019t been adjusting our forward-looking quarters. We basically took the original quarters. And as we delivered a strong quarter, we raised the full year based on what we delivered and have kept the convention for the upcoming quarters the same as what we had done in the past. That implies growth in line with the long-term organic outlook for the business. And obviously, we will deliver the strongest possible growth that we can. We will just see how the quarter plays out.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just on instruments. Instrument demand at Thermo across the group has been kind of very strong for a period of time. AI had another good quarter. Just wondering kind of what you are seeing on that front, and kind of what do you think about as you look ahead. While I am not guiding for \u201823, kind of is the instrument underlying strength sustainable? Just any color macro-wise and company-specific initiatives. Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. Thanks for the question. And the instruments business is performing really well, continuing the trend. It\u2019s great to have the growth rates that we delivered in terms of mid-teens organic growth in the quarter and which is terrific. Bookings were very strong. So, the outlook remains very good. Very impressed with how our chromatography and mass spectrometry business did. It\u2019s our fastest-growing business in the quarter and great growth in our electron microscopy and really good performance in chemical analysis. So, actually, the business strength is widespread and broad-based. So, it looks very good as we are finishing up the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Rachel.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And so first up, on the manufacturing side, you have had a few peers that have had some quality concerns in recent quarters around that sterile fill and finish market. So, can you just walk us through how that business performed for you in 3Q? And then do you think this really opens up any opportunity for share gains moving forward?\nMarc Casper: So, Rachel, thanks for the question. When I think about our pharma services business, it was one of the highlights for performance in the quarter. It\u2019s been a good growth driver for the company. Customers are driving towards more outsourcing. The smaller companies have less manufacturing and development capabilities in-house. So, the secular trends here are fantastic. We have an industry-leading position. We have been investing in new capabilities, strengthening quality systems, capacity, infrastructure, all of those things to position it well. And it\u2019s our job to do great work every day for our customers and focused on doing that really well. And that\u2019s what we are focused on, and it\u2019s important that we do it. And we want to grow at a reasonable rate and just make sure that we are doing great work every day for our customers.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Thanks. And then as a follow-up to Dan\u2019s question, just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into Europe. So, you mentioned that, that region was down 10% in the quarter, but you flagged that it was also impacted by that COVID testing comp. So, can you walk us through how much of that 10% decline was due to FX and COVID roll off? And then are you seeing any shift in demand within that region just given the macro uncertainty there? Thanks.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, in terms of the core growth in Europe, it\u2019s about 10%, excluding FX, excluding the testing side of things as well. So, good strong growth across the region. And as Marc said, it\u2019s a good concentration in pharma and biotech in the region, which is a strong growth business for us. So, yes, around about 10% in Europe. Great. Thanks Rachel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead, Dan.\nDan Arias: Good morning guys. Thanks. Marc, on the bioproduction capacity expansion that you have been working on, the $600 million plus that you outlined there as a build out, I am just wondering, as we head towards December if you might be able to sort of give a refreshed view on just how much of that will be \u2013 or do you think will be open to start the year versus what might be slated for \u201823? And then how you are feeling about filling out that capacity, just given what we are seeing in terms of end market demand and activity there?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. So, as a reminder, back in early 2021, we outlined our goals for expanding our capacity to meet the really strong long-term growth trends in our pharma services and our bioproduction businesses. And really, what we did is we looked at our 5-year roadmap of what we were planning to bring forward, and we pulled some of those things forward. In bioproduction, we made three specific investment decisions, some expansion of our single-use technology network. We opened a facility, a second facility in Utah. We opened up a facility in Tennessee. Both of those are operational. We expanded our Grand Island, New York cell culture media facility, that\u2019s also largely complete. And we just opened our purification facility in Massachusetts, which is our second purification facility. So, we are largely complete with the investments in bioproduction. But we are not operating at full capacity of that. We are not operating full shift seven days a week in the new facilities. We are rather going through the thoughtful ramp up. And that will continue to ramp up through 2023 and even into 2024 to bring it to kind of more of the full utilization. We feel very good about the demand environment. So, that capacity is bringing lead times back to more normal pre-pandemic levels, which is terrific. And that will position us really well for share gain. When I think about purification, which I think is worth a moment on, we were literally capacity constrained. We had demand that was so strong that we weren\u2019t able to bring on a lot of new business over the last few months. And it\u2019s great to have Johnsonville [ph] online because that allow us to continue to support the growth of new molecules and our customers. So, that\u2019s a quick recap on that.\nDan Arias: Okay. Helpful. And then just maybe on PPD, it sounds like things continue to go well there. And to the point of a couple of guys here, there is naturally a focus on 2023. You will have a tough comp there, actually like 2 years of tough comps there. So, anything that you might be able to add on just how you see PPD growth tracking going forward?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, our clinical research business, right, it serves an attractive end market within pharma and biotech, again, similar in a way to our pharma services business, more the innovations coming from the smaller companies. That really lends well to partnering with a clinical research organization. Our business is growing at a very high level. As Stephen highlighted, we are expecting 14% growth assumed in our guidance for the year, which is very strong. And what I am really excited about is the reaction from customers. I have seen quite a few customers in the third quarter and really had the opportunity to discuss what we are doing in clinical research services. And feedback is exciting. Our revenue synergies are very strong. They don\u2019t show up in the revenue to-date. They show up in the authorization for the future. And which is why I was able to really highlight that the business is not only ahead of the short-term deal model, but the projection is it will be well ahead over the long-term deal model. And we are excited about the momentum we will carry with that business going into 2023.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Tejas. Your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Thank you. Marc and Stephen, good morning. One follow-up for me on Europe, Marc. I mean energy costs are clearly in focus you are heading into the winter. Can you just help us dimension your cost on the energy side as a percent of your regional sales? And any kind of like resiliency plans that you have put in place? And then as a quick follow-up there, any color on research funding trends in Europe, particularly as government priorities might be shifting here a little bit?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, one of the powers of our PPI Business System and the benefits of our scale is to be able navigate the supply chain challenges that have existed in the world. And I would put energy availability as a potential challenge in Europe as we get into the winter. So, we went site-by-site and looked at what is the source of energy and made appropriate adjustments. So, a number of sites, we moved off of natural gas or there was a situation where the government said that we are going to be supplied. It\u2019s different scenarios depending on which country, what site, what purpose. So, I feel like we are well positioned to navigate that environment. In terms of research funding, it seems good. I mean obviously, the next level of European funding is being considered this month and at least what the public discussion is positive about the funding environment there. In terms of energy costs\u2026\nStephen Williamson: Yes. In terms of the energy cost, this is not material. What\u2019s material is make sure you are managing the ability to stay open the supply chain and looking into your customers. So, that\u2019s where we are spending our time and effort. And we switch the energy type. And it\u2019s about staying open and meeting that to our customers to support them through this.\nTejas Savant: Got it. And just one quick follow-up on PPD, if I may. One of your CRO peers, Marc, just mentioned investigator staff shortages at some sites, causing trial delays, not broad-based, but in some cases. Just curious what you are seeing in terms of labor market tightness there? And do you expect sort of wage inflation in specific to PPD to be a factor we should be thinking about into next year as well?\nMarc Casper: Business performed great. We obviously had 18% growth in the quarter, 14% growth outlook for the year. The way wage inflation works in that business is it gets passed through in the normal course pricing in the contract, so that you could have a quarter or something lag. But effectively, if there is unusual wage inflation that this gets passed through to the customer base. So, I don\u2019t see any particular significant challenge there. So, let me wrap it up here. As you heard this morning, another excellent quarter, we are on track to deliver an outstanding year, and that\u2019s going to set us up for a very bright future. And as always, thanks for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we turn into 2023. Thanks everyone.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. This includes 14% core organic revenue growth from $5.08 of adjusted earnings per share. Revenue in Q3 was approximately $800 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance with just over $600 million driven by another quarter of extremely strong core organic growth, just over $200 million from additional COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by a small additional headwind from FX. So continue strengthening the core once again broad-based across businesses and end markets. In terms of adjusted EPS, our PPI Business System enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat. And after accruing $0.18 of additional compensation in the quarter to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation, we delivered $0.36 of adjusted EPS higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q3 was another quarter of excellent financial performance. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results and as I mentioned, we delivered $5.08 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.79. On the top line in Q3, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $440 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 14% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 1% lower organic revenue, a 20% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 5% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America grew in the low single-digits. Europe declined 10%. Asia-Pacific grew in the low single-digits with China growing high single-digits and rest of the world declined high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 760 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. The company's adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.7%, 970 basis points lower than Q3 last year. For the third quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. After factoring in the decision we took to accrue the additional colleague compensation that I mentioned earlier, both adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin came in as we had anticipated in our prior guidance. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points versus Q3 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million in Q3, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.7%. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $106 million. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.8%. This was 240 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The Q3 rate was 75 basis points lower than we assumed in the quarter in the prior guide due to the timing of discrete tax planning items between Q3 and Q4 with no net change for the year overall. Average diluted shares were 395 million in Q3, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $5.7 billion, and free cash flow was $4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and the year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and $29.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.1x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher than the prior year quarter but does skew some of the reported segment margins. As I mentioned earlier, we're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we outlined at the beginning of the year, we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 20%, and organic revenue was 17% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 43%. And adjusted operating margin was 35.1%, down 14 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and the strategic investments that we're making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 10% in Q3, and organic growth was 16%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was broad-based led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 47%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, favorable business mix and strong productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue declined 22%, and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we saw a strong underlying growth in our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 29% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 21%, down 210 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered positive business mix and good productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volumes. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q3, reported revenue increased 60%. Organic growth was 12%, and the impact of acquisitions was 53%. During Q3, we had strong growth in the Pharma Services business as well as the research and safety market channel. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well. And during the quarter, we delivered high teens core organic growth and contributed $1.82 billion of revenue to the segment. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 89%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 200 basis points higher than Q3 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix, good productivity and also saw the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion. This includes a raise in the core organic growth outlook for the year from 11% to 12%. And on the bottom line, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The increase in the revenue guidance is driven by three elements: an increase of just over $600 million in the outlook for the core business, an increase of just over $200 million for COVID-19 testing revenue and a $200 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. From a core organic revenue perspective, the strength of our performance is enabling us to raise our full year core organic revenue growth outlook from 11% to 12%, and there is no change in the assumptions for core organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to COVID-19 testing revenue. We now expect $2.8 billion of testing revenue for the year, which includes the assumption of an endemic run rate level of $100 million per quarter in Q4. Our Q4 testing assumption has not changed from our previous guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, the $0.08 raise for the year consists of $0.54 of operational beat in Q3, partially offset by the decision to pay $180 million or $0.36 of additional one-time colleague compensation. And half of this is accrued in Q3, and the remainder will be in Q4. The full year guidance change also incorporates $0.10 lower EPS in Q4 for the additional FX headwind in the quarter and the revised phasing of our tax rate. All of this is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 from $22.93 to $23.01, further improving a very strong outlook for the year. From a margin standpoint, we now expect the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 24.9%. To help you with your modeling, I think it's worth spending a moment on the impact of the inflationary environment on the company's financial profile. During the year, we've been very effective in passing on higher price to offset higher-than-normal inflation. This results in no net impact on our adjusted operating income dollars as we're effectively offsetting the added inflation, but it does affect the calculation of margins because of the revenue base being higher. The impact on margins for the full year from this dynamic is about 60 basis points, but again, no net impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS. So now let me provide you with some additional details on the updated 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business, is expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 14% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business. We now expect the business to contribute $2.03 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. In terms of FX, we've incorporated current rates into our guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $1.46 billion on revenue or 3.7%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 is now expected to be $0.77 for the full year or 3.1%. Should FX rates stay the same as they are right now, we estimate the impact on FX in 2023 would be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1 billion on revenue and $0.75 on adjusted EPS. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $440 million in 2022. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, which includes a 13.6% tax rate in Q4. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. For free cash flow, we see $7 billion at the high end of the range of outcomes for the year. The actual free cash flow will depend on the year-end level of working capital. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance also continues to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And to conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. We're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. So Derik, we look forward to giving you full details in 3 months' time in terms of the Q4 call. But think about the margin profile, there are different elements of the revenue, and think about how we model it in the long-term model for the company. 50 basis points of expansion on core essentially equates to about 30% pull-through on the margin profile and the revenue dollars increasing from a core standpoint. The FX headwind that we outlined on the call, that's also roughly a 30% margin pull-through. And on testing, it's a very profitable element of our business. And we factor in appropriately addressing the variable costs and the non-repeat of some of the colleague compensation one-time that we did this year. That pull-through on testing is \u2013 no, just 10% margin higher than the core. So, that will help you with modeling in terms around your own assumptions around the organic growth and testing and FX. And as I said, that's all incorporated in the long-term model. And then on the call, I called out that 60 basis points impact from the \u2013 added impact of added inflation and what we're doing on pricing and managing the company well to offset the impacts of the added inflation as more revenue to the company and negate the impact of the additional inflation. So, no net impact on operating income dollars. So when I think about all of that wrapped up for our long-term financial model we gave you back in May, we're on track to achieve or exceed the adjusted EPS target we put at that. We're managing very well through the dynamic times. Look forward to giving more details in \u201823 on the next call. Yes. So, have a better view on inflation three months' time, but we are effectively managing the dynamics now and expect to effectively manage them going forward. And this has been about pricing just if you can in an inflation environment. It's pricing appropriately, given the inflation dynamics and then bringing our customers along with us on that journey. So, I feel good about our ability to manage the dynamic going forward should the inflation levels remain at the elevated level. No, I think the dynamics that I outlined earlier on is going to pull through. The assumption there is that don't repeat. We will figure out what the current situation is during the year and make the right calls and manage the company appropriately. But when I think about that pull-through on the testing, that includes the non-repeat on those actions as well. Yes. So, in terms of the core growth in Europe, it's about 10%, excluding FX, excluding the testing side of things as well. So, good strong growth across the region. And as Marc said, it's a good concentration in pharma and biotech in the region, which is a strong growth business for us. So, yes, around about 10% in Europe. Great. Thanks Rachel. Yes. In terms of the energy cost, this is not material. What's material is make sure you are managing the ability to stay open the supply chain and looking into your customers. So, that's where we are spending our time and effort. And we switch the energy type. And it's about staying open and meeting that to our customers to support them through this."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing incredibly well and demonstrating broad-based strength and this is allowing us to raise our guidance once again for the full year. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I am very proud of our team's great execution, effectively navigating dynamic times and continuing to drive market share gains. Our ongoing success is driven by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System and I will talk about that more later. So let me recap the Q3 financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.68 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.08 per share. Turning to our end markets, as we saw in the second quarter, we had a continuation of strong performance in Q3. This was driven by good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some additional color. Starting with pharma and biotech, we delivered outstanding performance with growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across the businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Our differentiated customer value proposition is resonating with our customers and helping to further elevate our trusted partner status. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in our biosciences and electron microscopy businesses. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the high-teens for the quarter. We have broad-based strength across all of our analytical instrument businesses serving these customers. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, as expected, our revenue was approximately 30% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, we delivered good core business growth led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. So now let me turn to our growth strategy, which has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. The investments we have made over the past few years are fueling growth and generating strong returns. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me start with innovation. Our focus on high-impact innovation enables our customers to address some of the world's greatest challenges. We further strengthened our position in Q3 and I'd like to give you just a few highlights. During the quarter, we advanced our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer during the International Mass Spectrometry Conference. This instrument provides faster, more sensitive sample analysis for proteomics and metabolomics research and insights into clinically relevant biomarkers implicated in cancer. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. This instrument will help provide more insights into how proteins and other molecules operate within cells, enabling breakthroughs in treatments for infectious diseases and neurogenerative disorders. We also continue to advance our clinical next-gen sequencing portfolio to help our customers better understand, diagnose and treat cancer. We recently launched the Oncomine Dx Express Test and Oncomine Reporter Dx software, a precision medicine offering which detects genomic abnormalities in tumor samples and helps match cancer patients with approved therapies and clinical trials. These products recently received CE-IVD certification and are designed to run on our Ion Torrent Genexus next-generation sequencing system, allowing doctors to use NGS technology to improve care by bringing the power of precision medicine closer to patients. Another key pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. It's all about leveraging the incredible capabilities we have across our company and delivering them in a way that enables our customers to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity and that makes it rational for them to do more business with us. The accelerated investments we have made over the past couple of years are driving growth. This is particularly true for our pharma and biotech customers, where we continue to build on our trusted partner status as we bring our new capacity and capabilities online to meet the strong demand for our products and services. Let me share a couple of examples. During the quarter, we opened a purification technologies facility in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. This site will manufacture resin beads used in the production of biologics. As you know, we have a rapidly growing purification business, which is highly valued by our customers. This new facility will ensure we can meet their increasing demand. We also continue to strengthen our global pharma services network, adding viral vector manufacturing capabilities in Plainville, Massachusetts. I joined the opening of this facility and it was a terrific event. We had significant attendance from our customers and we were able to showcase the various ways in which our team can support their cell and gene therapy programs. The facility also utilizes and showcases our industry-leading single-use bioprocessing technologies and analytical instruments, which demonstrates to our pharma and biotech customers the uniqueness of our capabilities and how they can best utilize in bringing new medicines to market. So, these are just a couple of examples that demonstrate how we are continuing to build our trusted partner status and further strengthen our unique customer value proposition. Our pharma biotech customers are capitalizing on this, which also includes PPD, our clinical research business. I will cover that later in my remarks. Before turning to an update on capital deployment, I thought I'd briefly reflect on the impact of our growth strategy in 2022. As you know, the actions we have taken over the last 2 years have allowed us to meaningfully accelerate our organic growth and position us to continue our long-term industry leading performance. The product launches this year have been truly outstanding and the pipeline, it looks fantastic. The new capabilities that we have invested in have meaningfully strengthened our unique customer value proposition and our customers are continuing to expand their relationship with us. All of this is enabling us to deliver industry leading core growth. Let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. The acquisition of PPD is a great example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. The business is performing incredibly well, delivering high-teens core revenue growth in the quarter. The combination of a great business and a smooth integration is driving excellent financial performance. In addition, our customers are excited by the capabilities we have to support their clinical trial needs and that is translating into meaningful revenue synergies for an even brighter future. All of this is enabling us to drive short and long-term returns on the acquisition that are well ahead of the deal model. Let me spend a moment on our PPI Business System, which helps us continually improve the customer experience, quality, productivity in our company overall. The goal of PPI is to find a better way everyday. This is an essential element of our company culture. In dynamic times, we really see the strength of our PPI Business System. As you know, it was applied with incredible impact to allow us to lead the response to the pandemic. And today, it's applied to solve supply chain challenges, increase efficiency and helps our teams find better ways to offset inflation. It also enhances our ability to unlock the value creation in our acquisitions. Our experienced management team, along with the benefit of our scale and our PPI Business System, uniquely position the company to successfully navigate through whatever macroeconomic conditions come our way. So overall, it was another fantastic quarter, thanks to great execution by our teams, the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System. Turning to our progress on our environmental, social and governance priorities. During the quarter, we continued to make great progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, announcing an agreement with Enel North America to purchase wind power renewable electricity equal to half of our U.S. electricity needs. This agreement will significantly advance our ambitious emissions reduction strategy. I am also very pleased that we have achieved our 2020 commitment to hire 500 graduates from the historically black colleges and universities, supporting our commitment to diversity and inclusion and increasing our positive social impact, so another strong quarter in progressing our ESG priorities. Now, I'd like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion, which would result in 12% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and a modest impact of additional COVID-19 testing. These are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds and demonstrate how well we are operating with speed at scale to enable our customer success. In addition, our guidance reflects the decision to help our colleagues with the temporary impact of inflation. We will be making a one-time payment of approximately one week's additional salary to non-executive colleagues. So to summarize our key takeaways in the third quarter, our outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date reflect our team's excellent execution, the benefits of our proven growth strategy and the positive impact of our PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well and markets continue to be strong. We are gaining market share. We are seeing the benefits of our accelerated investments in innovative new products and enhanced capabilities and capacity. In addition, our clinical research business has delivered excellent results and customers are valuing the benefit of our expanded offering. And our experienced management team, the benefits of our scale and our PPI Business System uniquely position us to continue to navigate the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 again and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Jack, thanks for the question. So probably best to start one level up, and then I'll get to the details of it, right? When I think about pharma and biotech more broadly, right, it's our largest end market, represents about 60% of our business performing incredibly well, right? Mid-teens growth this quarter, mid-teens growth year-to-date. And that growth number actually doesn't include PPD, right, which is actually growing in the quarter, grew faster, right? So very strong, it's broad-based. Customer demand continues to be strong across the portfolio. All our businesses are performing very nicely. The long-term trends look very positive. And when I think back and I think because we live in a moment, if you go back the last 5 years, it actually averaged for this whole segment mid-teens growth, right? So it's not this year or this quarter. It's really been a long-term trend long before COVID, right? So very, very strong. Now so what's going on in bioproduction, right? There is obviously been a lot of commentary over the last week on the topic. And as a reminder, we have a leading presence to cell culture media, single-use technologies and actually quite a rapidly growing purification business. In aggregate, it's less than 10% of our total revenue. It's an awesome business, right? They performed very well in the quarter. It grew faster than the pharma and biotech average. The dynamics are very good, and we're very well positioned to deliver great growth going forward in serving our customer base. What I would say is if I think about where we are and think about the third quarter, right, it was a terrific quarter. If you look at the strength, right, that we had in terms of our core growth it's really broad-based, right? And you look at it and you say, alright, pharma and biotech that grew in the mid-teens. Industrial and applied, that grew in the high teens. Academic and government grew in the mid-single digits. And the core in healthcare and diagnostics, which is the indicator of what's going on in that end market, that actually was a mid-single-digit growth as well. So it's really very strong. So I like where we are at the 9 months. And in terms of exactly how we will be in \u201823, we will obviously talk about that in January in terms of what the outlook is. But certainly, at this point in the year, our end markets are strong, and our company's performance has been exceptional. Good morning, Derik. So I'll start, and I'm sure Stephen will chime in as well. So obviously, at a high level, we will get into this in January, right? Why do we do January is we will have the benefit of two things, which is where was the exact finish to the year, what's our jumping-off point? And second, what is the most close in view of the macro environment, right? So we will see how that plays out in January. But \u2013 excuse me. So if I go through the components, right? Obviously, the company is performing at an incredibly strong level. So that was very encouraging. As Stephen outlined, it will be a headwind that could change, obviously. But right now, we gave you that number so that you can at least update the models to reflect what current FX range rates are. And that's about $1 billion of revenue headwind and about $0.75 of adjusted EPS. The second one that I think is important, and it's an assumption, which is we're assuming in the fourth quarter that we're at an endemic level of COVID-19 testing. So that's $100 million of revenue in the quarter. And if that plays out in that way, then I think that's a reasonable assumption per quarter for next year. So you're going to have the view on the COVID runoff down to the endemic rate on testing. And from the rest of the perspective, the business is in really good shape. And Stephen, you can comment on margins or anything else that I might have missed. Yes. So Derik, in terms of vaccines and therapies, as a reminder, we said we would expect to do in our core revenue about $1.5 billion this year. We did just under $400 million in Q3. That brings the year-to-date to $1.3 billion and on track to achieve or exceed the $1.5 billion. So I feel good about that. Our \u2013 as a reminder, on electron microscopy, it's not correlated to the CapEx spend. It's correlated to R&D and new nodes and that business is performing incredibly well in terms of growth, with bookings all of the different metrics really doing incredibly well. Thank you, Derik. Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question and a follow-up on that. So if I think about inventory, right, and I read some of the Q&A that happened last week. And somehow that translated into our own share price, which is a little bit of a head scratcher to me. If you think about inventory levels, right, I guess I always start at the high level. Three of our businesses, which are a large portion of the company, literally have nothing to do with inventory at all, right, which is pharma services, our clinical research business and our analytical instrument business has nothing to do with inventory. So I think it's important to remember that. The second, when you get down to the businesses that do have inventory levels, some of which we hold, some of which our customers hold, we do have really good visibility into it. And we help our customers appropriately manage those levels of inventory. I feel good about the position that we're in, alright? And for the couple of customers that might have COVID-related things, I'm sure that they purchased a bit more because they had a high range of demand volatility that they were managing. But in terms of our bioproduction business, it grew well faster than pharma and biotech. The outlook is really strong, and I feel very well positioned going forward. And Patrick, the only thing I would add to that is when you think about how we describe the approach, right, we are not marking it up, right. We are driving substantial productivity. We are passing through an appropriate level of pricing to reflect real cost increase, and we are helping our customers through this period of time. And that's how we thought about it. And we think that's the right thing, given the importance of Thermo Fisher to our customers. And we will do an appropriate level of pricing based on the environment in \u201823 as we get into. So, Vijay, thanks for the question. So, when I think about how do we think about growth, right, is 7% to 9%. And if you take the long-term model, right. So, I am not commenting on \u201823. I don't make a comment there. But that's industry-leading, right. I think folks forget that. That's \u2013 that number is higher than anybody else has committed to in the industry. So, I feel great about that. And of course, we are the biggest company, so which makes it super cool, right, in terms of what that says about share gain, right. So, I think that sometimes is forgotten. We are not constraining ourselves to 7% to 9%, right. We are growing 12% this year, right. And the measure that we actually use is, are we doing a good job, right. I mean the 7% to 9% is assuming 4% to 6% market growth over the long period. The market growth is a little better than that. I feel great about our 12% performance. When we sit here at the end of 2022, what we do know is that our business will have been larger as a starting off point than what we assumed in the long-term model. So, right there, we have had more core growth that will offset some of the transition from vaccines and therapies that move into the other parts of core. So, we are super well positioned. And we will figure out is 7% to 9% the right number. That's kind of our default unless something is radically different as a starting point to a year. And obviously, if the conditions are super robust, it could be higher than that. If we are in a gale-force recession, it could be lower than that, right. But I think at this point in the year, the long-term is we are doing better on the top line. We are right on track on EPS and we are incredibly well positioned into 2023, and we will figure it out. And I don't think we are going to surprise anybody, right. We will all look at the macro and say, yes, those numbers make a ton of sense based on what the environment is as we sit here in January. And once again, we will be ambitious, and we will deliver great performance. So, in terms of the macroeconomic environment, beyond the inflationary impacts, which we had explained, actually, our end markets have been very strong. As you know, I gave you the cut by the four kind of customer sets, actually geographically, no particular pattern that jumps out as a concern. When you look at Europe, the core growth actually was 10% growth. So, Europe was actually strong. And it makes sense because you have a large pharma and biotech proportion of that. So, that was good. And our assumption is that in China, which will have a very good year and a good quarter, it's probably slightly lower than the long-term historical view. And that's mostly the COVID policies there. So, we are always looking for is there something lurking, but right now, things remain strong. Fourth quarter, it's the same assumptions that we have been using all year, which is we haven't been adjusting our forward-looking quarters. We basically took the original quarters. And as we delivered a strong quarter, we raised the full year based on what we delivered and have kept the convention for the upcoming quarters the same as what we had done in the past. That implies growth in line with the long-term organic outlook for the business. And obviously, we will deliver the strongest possible growth that we can. We will just see how the quarter plays out. Yes. Thanks for the question. And the instruments business is performing really well, continuing the trend. It's great to have the growth rates that we delivered in terms of mid-teens organic growth in the quarter and which is terrific. Bookings were very strong. So, the outlook remains very good. Very impressed with how our chromatography and mass spectrometry business did. It's our fastest-growing business in the quarter and great growth in our electron microscopy and really good performance in chemical analysis. So, actually, the business strength is widespread and broad-based. So, it looks very good as we are finishing up the year. So, Rachel, thanks for the question. When I think about our pharma services business, it was one of the highlights for performance in the quarter. It's been a good growth driver for the company. Customers are driving towards more outsourcing. The smaller companies have less manufacturing and development capabilities in-house. So, the secular trends here are fantastic. We have an industry-leading position. We have been investing in new capabilities, strengthening quality systems, capacity, infrastructure, all of those things to position it well. And it's our job to do great work every day for our customers and focused on doing that really well. And that's what we are focused on, and it's important that we do it. And we want to grow at a reasonable rate and just make sure that we are doing great work every day for our customers. Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. So, as a reminder, back in early 2021, we outlined our goals for expanding our capacity to meet the really strong long-term growth trends in our pharma services and our bioproduction businesses. And really, what we did is we looked at our 5-year roadmap of what we were planning to bring forward, and we pulled some of those things forward. In bioproduction, we made three specific investment decisions, some expansion of our single-use technology network. We opened a facility, a second facility in Utah. We opened up a facility in Tennessee. Both of those are operational. We expanded our Grand Island, New York cell culture media facility, that's also largely complete. And we just opened our purification facility in Massachusetts, which is our second purification facility. So, we are largely complete with the investments in bioproduction. But we are not operating at full capacity of that. We are not operating full shift seven days a week in the new facilities. We are rather going through the thoughtful ramp up. And that will continue to ramp up through 2023 and even into 2024 to bring it to kind of more of the full utilization. We feel very good about the demand environment. So, that capacity is bringing lead times back to more normal pre-pandemic levels, which is terrific. And that will position us really well for share gain. When I think about purification, which I think is worth a moment on, we were literally capacity constrained. We had demand that was so strong that we weren't able to bring on a lot of new business over the last few months. And it's great to have Johnsonville [ph] online because that allow us to continue to support the growth of new molecules and our customers. So, that's a quick recap on that. Yes. So, our clinical research business, right, it serves an attractive end market within pharma and biotech, again, similar in a way to our pharma services business, more the innovations coming from the smaller companies. That really lends well to partnering with a clinical research organization. Our business is growing at a very high level. As Stephen highlighted, we are expecting 14% growth assumed in our guidance for the year, which is very strong. And what I am really excited about is the reaction from customers. I have seen quite a few customers in the third quarter and really had the opportunity to discuss what we are doing in clinical research services. And feedback is exciting. Our revenue synergies are very strong. They don't show up in the revenue to-date. They show up in the authorization for the future. And which is why I was able to really highlight that the business is not only ahead of the short-term deal model, but the projection is it will be well ahead over the long-term deal model. And we are excited about the momentum we will carry with that business going into 2023. Yes. So, one of the powers of our PPI Business System and the benefits of our scale is to be able navigate the supply chain challenges that have existed in the world. And I would put energy availability as a potential challenge in Europe as we get into the winter. So, we went site-by-site and looked at what is the source of energy and made appropriate adjustments. So, a number of sites, we moved off of natural gas or there was a situation where the government said that we are going to be supplied. It's different scenarios depending on which country, what site, what purpose. So, I feel like we are well positioned to navigate that environment. In terms of research funding, it seems good. I mean obviously, the next level of European funding is being considered this month and at least what the public discussion is positive about the funding environment there. In terms of energy costs... Business performed great. We obviously had 18% growth in the quarter, 14% growth outlook for the year. The way wage inflation works in that business is it gets passed through in the normal course pricing in the contract, so that you could have a quarter or something lag. But effectively, if there is unusual wage inflation that this gets passed through to the customer base. So, I don't see any particular significant challenge there. So, let me wrap it up here. As you heard this morning, another excellent quarter, we are on track to deliver an outstanding year, and that's going to set us up for a very bright future. And as always, thanks for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we turn into 2023. Thanks everyone."

So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses. As I reflect on the quarter, I am very proud of the team\u2019s great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business. Our ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. You will see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year. So, let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share. Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. We are continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we have earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low double-digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology. During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers\u2019 COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as I reflect on this quarter\u2019s performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by three factors: the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we have made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns. Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I will start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I will highlight a few of these. We have an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers\u2019 work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme automated sample prep platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating a range of previously manual steps. We also launched the cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDO software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies. In addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics to help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company. Turning to our high growth and emerging markets, we are really thrilled with our team\u2019s progress. You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind, because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I am so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers, and our support for local COVID-19 testing. So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. Our capabilities enable our customers\u2019 ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities. Let me share a couple of examples. In our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers\u2019 research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we have been delivering. I have had the opportunity to visit both sides a number of times and it\u2019s really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that\u2019s driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we are supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition. Now, turning to capital deployment, I\u2019d like to share some of the other steps we have taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We are very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth. In May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization and I am so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward. The combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers and we are seeing strong momentum in the business. All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of the deal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. Turning now to an update to our ESG initiatives, we released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we are continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It\u2019s great to see the progress detailed in the report and also reflecting the progress we have made through our commitment to ESG over many years. For this quarter, I will highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy is sold at onsite rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels. We are also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals which will ultimately have an impact across our value chain. As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward. Now, I\u2019d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021 and we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share. This higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter. Our outstanding results in Q2 highlight the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI business system and our extraordinary team. Our business is performing very well and we are gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns. We are really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share, and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets. From a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we had assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2 and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single-digits, Europe declined in the low double-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low double-digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter. You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we are making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $394 million in Q2, approximately $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $115 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we are referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business and that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment. So, moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we are making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. This is offset by lower COVD-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%. Organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%. During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations. During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segment, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also still the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion. We\u2019re also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three elements: a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. Let me provide you some color on each of these elements. So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business, this reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance. As I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raised the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we\u2019re well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risked approach to the outlook. In terms of FX, we\u2019ve incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind on of $1.25 billion on revenue, up 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance. In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up the $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX. We now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. So to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI business system execution. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year. We\u2019re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. You may proceed.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.\nMarc Casper: Hi, Jack. Good morning. \nJack Meehan: Good morning. So versus the Analyst Day at the end of May, a lot has transpired on the macro environment. We see this morning, GDP officially declined again for 2Q. It would be great to hear just your latest thoughts on macro sensitivity for Thermo Fisher. And if you\u2019ll humor me as we sit here in July, just any thoughts on positioning for 2023, how that might fit in versus the 3-year CAGRs you talked about a couple of months ago?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack, I guess the first thing is business performing extraordinarily well, right? We have broad-based strength. As I look at the companies that have reported, we\u2019ve done very well from a top line perspective. So I feel good about how we\u2019re performing. Bookings performance was very good. So if I think about what are we seeing in our business, we\u2019re seeing very strong strength, right? In terms of the macro, obviously, when you read the papers or wherever information source, lots and lots of challenges in the world. And in the last quarter, we articulated some of them and how we factored some of that into the thinking for our outlook. And so what do we think about sensitivity? This company is incredibly well positioned to navigate whatever the world throws at us, right? And the industry in and of itself is attractive as well as sensitive economically than many. We are very well positioned within it, and we have tremendous momentum. When I think about \u2013 if we see a downturn, and we\u2019re not seeing the signs of one, but it doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be one. We have the benefit of a track record of dynamic of navigating dynamic times and exiting those periods really an incredibly strong industry leader. We benefit from an experienced management team, an incredible team around the world, a proven growth strategy in a PPI business system, which gives us great operational discipline. As you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of actions over the last few years to strengthen our position in the end markets we serve. And today, relative to the recession and the great financial crisis, we have less industrial exposure. As a reminder, about 30% of our revenue going into the last recession was industrial. Today, it\u2019s about 13%. And Pharma and Biotech is much larger, and that has been the least economically sensitive of the end markets, and that represents just under 60% of our revenue. And when I think about our mix, we\u2019re more service and consumables oriented than we were then. Then, it was 65% of our revenue. Today, it\u2019s 82% of our revenue. So the company is performing well. Our end markets are good, and we will manage through whatever the world throws at us. And you see that in the results, right? You see that in the \u2013 FX got meaningfully more challenging for all global companies, and we\u2019re able to power through that and deliver an increase in our guidance.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then my second question is on capital allocation. So it looks like it was a relatively quiet quarter here, though I know you\u2019re always very active internally. Just \u2013 it would be great to get your thoughts on the deal pipeline. Do you think it\u2019s getting more interesting with some of these macro challenges around the world? And then given PPD\u2019s strong performance here out of the gate, just thoughts on adding more CRO exposure to the business?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So from a capital deployment perspective, I really wanted to do the deeper dive on the progress of PPD, and we did a large acquisition in December, right? And the first thing we have to demonstrate is that we\u2019re great owners and operators of the businesses that are part of the family, and that\u2019s always our number one priority, and that business has performed great. And we have an active pipeline. And when I think about how valuations have come in many sectors that creates opportunities, right? So we\u2019re actively engaged as we always are and we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on the M&A opportunities that will be out there in the landscape. So thank you, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thanks, Marc.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. You may proceed.\nPatrick Donnelly: Marc, maybe one on the bioprocessing business, it continues to be a source of strength for you guys, among others. Can you just talk about the performance this quarter for that business? It seems like it accelerated for a few players across the industry. And then secondarily, inside that bioprocessing piece on the COVID vaccine side, are you still kind of \u2013 obviously, you de-risked a little bit last quarter. I think you lowered it $500 million, $600 million for the year. Maybe just updated thoughts on that front along with the core bioprocessing piece?\nMarc Casper: Patrick, good morning, thanks for the questions. So, when I think about bioprocessing, I always like to frame it in the context of how we serve former biotech, right? The market will level up, it\u2019s very attractive. We have a leading presence, and we\u2019re really well positioned to serve those customer base. And you\u2019ve seen us deliver really strong growth. When I think about production, right, or bioproduction, as a reminder, we have two major activities that we have within our company. We have our bioproduction business, which is the leading presence in cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as our pharma services business, which is both drug substance and drug product for biologics. And you see us play with the monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, cell therapy, plasmid, sterile fill, finish all part of that. So it\u2019s a large portion of our total presence in serving pharma biotech. Outstanding quarter, right, when I look at \u2013 and that was both across the services business and bioproduction. When I look at how others have done and reported, I feel very, very good about our performance. And the outlook here is really positive. When I think about your question on the COVID vaccine therapies, our outlook for the year is $1.5 billion. That\u2019s the same as it was in Q1. We did just over $400 million of revenue in Q2, which was right in line with our expectations. It brings us to a little bit over $900 million at the halfway point of the year. So we feel good about our role in supporting our customers\u2019 activities in vaccines and therapies. That\u2019s part of our core revenue growth. So over time, when there is less demand for those capabilities, we will transition that well to other applications, which we do all the time.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s really helpful, Marc. And then maybe just on the pricing side. I know Stephen kind of talked about that being a key bridge to raising the guidance in the back half. I think you previously discussed maybe 2x the normal in pricing to combat inflation. Can you just kind of update where we are on the pricing side? Any pushback from customers? Just maybe just what those conversations have been like? Obviously, pricing power has obviously been a great thing for you guys over the years, but that this is getting to be the highest level we\u2019ve seen. So maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing side. Thank you, Marc.\nMarc Casper: I\u2019ll start with the customer comments, and Stephen will go through his thoughts. We\u2019re incredibly transparent with our customers and a partner to enable their success. So we\u2019ve had very constructive discussions, and we\u2019ve operated with transparency and has allowed us to get an appropriate level of pricing.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Patrick, in terms of the setup on pricing, then back to kind of a normal year for us, about 0.5% to 1 percentage point of net price across the whole business. And for the first half of the year, we\u2019ve been running kind of slightly north of double the high end of that range. And the additional pricing we put in place is really to offset higher inflation that we\u2019re seeing largely energy costs in Europe as we think about the change in guidance. And that change in guidance is really slightly higher revenue and no impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS, but a little pressure on margin, which is the reason why the overall margin came down in the guidance from the last guidance. But that\u2019s kind of active management of the pricing to offset the additional inflation.\nPatrick Donnelly: Helpful.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik, you may proceed.\nMike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Marc, I want to follow up on a lot of your comments in the prepared remarks, you really seem to emphasize share gains again this quarter. And the core business is doing really well in a number of different segments. So curious if you could provide a little bit more color on some specifics on where you\u2019re seeing the biggest share wins versus your peers? Is it in sort of the core chromatography and mass spec and AI or in the channel or bioprocessing portfolio we\u2019re just talking about? Just sort of what\u2019s working well and what\u2019s allowing you to take that share? And any specifics you can give on individual pieces of the business would be helpful.\nMarc Casper: Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the 13% core growth \u2013 the 14% core growth for the first half, really strong momentum in the business and very broad-based, right? So that\u2019s exciting. And when I look at how the industry is reporting, we\u2019re faring very well. So I\u2019m proud of the team\u2019s efforts. So some of the highlights, geographically, the team is doing incredibly good job in China. So that\u2019s one lens. End market lens, pharma biotech going incredibly quickly, right, with mid-teens growth. So that\u2019s another of lens. And then the way you framed it, from the businesses perspective, analytical instruments is doing very well. It\u2019s going to see the 13% growth in the segment, great performance in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our channel is performing well, pharma services. And then while it doesn\u2019t it\u2019s in the core. Our PPD acquisition has performed very well. We\u2019ve obviously had the benefit of seeing a couple of industry participants report and that business is going well. And to be candid, it\u2019s pretty much broad-based cost business. I haven\u2019t mentioned either. It\u2019s not the \u2013 I didn\u2019t say something to us not doing well. The team is really humming right now.\nMike Ryskin: Okay, great. And then for the follow-up, if you look at how this year has trended sort of what you\u2019re implying for the rest of the year, what you\u2019re guiding for the rest of the year for COVID diagnostics. There is still going to be a little bit of a cliff as we go into next year, a little bit of a reduction in COVID diagnostics from \u201822 to \u201823, just given what you were able to accomplish in the first half of the year. But the base business is doing incredibly well, and you\u2019re now guiding to 11% core business. So, you have got your multiyear target of 7% to 9% out there, right? If we are using this year as a jumping off point, is there any reason to think that next year shouldn\u2019t be squarely in that range as well despite the comps and then sort of adjusting for the COVID diagnostic delta between $2.5 billion this year to the run rate next year? I am just trying to do the bridge between the base and the COVID diagnostics, sort of where that puts the model.\nMarc Casper: So, Mike, I guess a few thoughts on 2023, right. And obviously, I am looking forward \u2013 I am actually doing it every day, it\u2019s not that. But when we get to January, I will be looking forward to giving you the \u2013 give you the update on sort of what we think for the year, right, so in the details. What we don\u2019t know now, right. And it\u2019s just nobody knows is what\u2019s the macro environment, right. Is it \u2013 was it like the first half of this year, well, phenomenal, right, or is it different, and so we will appropriately set the context for 2023, when we get there. But I think there are a couple of things that are worth saying at this point in time to at least help you think about it. One is the core business, right. It\u2019s going to be large, right. We are growing the business faster this year than we had outlined in the long-term model. So, I mean the jumping off point in 2023 is we are going to have a bigger business. And that\u2019s core that drives earnings power and all of those things. We will have an appropriate growth range based on how we see the world at that point in time. We will figure that out as it gets closer. And then Stephen might \u2013 do you want to comment on FX and because I know that the movements have been enormous, and you might want to frame how to think about that for next year. But I feel great about how the core business performed.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. I think looking at FX rates, if they stayed the same as they are now, that will be kind of an additional year-over-year headwind next year, about $600 million, about $0.40 of adjusted EPS. And I think about the mix of currencies and where currencies have changed. Obviously, that could change as we go through the year, but something to watch out for in corporate.\nMarc Casper: Yes. And Mike, when I think about the 7% to 9% growth, that\u2019s the long-term sort of average we worked through. So, it can vary in a given year, as this year, obviously, is above that, it can be within and it can be different, just depends on the measure we use is, are we delivering really good performance, right. And it\u2019s going to be in the context of what\u2019s the environment. So, that\u2019s going to wait until January. Thanks for the questions.\nMike Ryskin: Very appreciated. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So, my first question is on China. Growth of over 20% in the quarter was very impressive. You flagged that some of that was driven by COVID testing. So, can you just break out what was the COVID contribution versus core growth in China? And then what are your latest expectations for China for the year, given some of the headlines you have been seeing about additional lockdowns?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So \u2013 when I think about the business in China, the team really did an excellent job I think really difficult circumstances. They basically had a month in the Shanghai region to basically get the business to really incredible performance in June. So, I am very proud of that. We had good growth in the core business, much better than we expected. And a nice chunk of the overdrive in COVID testing was in supporting the local activities. So, we did a really good job there. We don\u2019t sell our assays there, but we do sell our instruments and in our reagents to support local demand. So, we had strong core growth and a meaningful response in China, actually larger than we typically have in China for COVID testing. The way I think about the outlook is it should be a good market in the second half of the year. I have no doubt there will be some level of COVID disruption. What that will be, when it will be, where it will be, hard to know. But just given the zero COVID policies, there will be bumps on the road. But the team knows how to navigate that, and I feel like we will get through that period effectively. And there could be some headwinds here or there, but nothing that we see at this point in time in China. It looks very strong.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great to hear. And then can you just give us an update on what you are seeing for earlier-stage work in biopharma, just given some of the funding concerns pressuring those mid-cap biotech customers. I know that\u2019s a small percent of your revenue, but still just any dynamic and color on what you are seeing in that market would be helpful. Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Rachel, thanks for the question. Pharma market has been very strong. One of the questions because as our investors and analysts ask the question. I asked the team about are there patterns, trends, anything that is jumping out. And it\u2019s actually been broad-based strength, right. We are seeing good growth in the various sub-segments within the customer base. So, I feel like the momentum is strong. Orders were strong. There is always company-specific challenges right. There will be companies that have bad data, bad report out or a company that\u2019s going to a cat and whatever [ph]. And we help those companies navigate those times. We help them drive productivity and accelerate innovation, and those things. But we continue to see strong momentum in pharma and biotech. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nMatt Sykes: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter Marc and Steve. Just my first question, Marc, when you announced the PPD acquisition last year, you said that part of the rationale was due to your large pharma customers wanting to reduce the number of trusted partnerships they had. And given that we are more than half a year on from the close of the deal and we are potentially facing a tougher economic environment where cost savings might become more important. Have you been able to capitalize on expanding these relationships? And could you share any specific examples of partnership expansions with large pharma as a result of the addition of the PPD business?\nMarc Casper: So, Matt, thanks for the question. One of the things that\u2019s just been phenomenal is the speed at which we have been able to get meaningful authorizations that clearly synergy work, meaning the benefits of bringing the combination together and we have had several of the larger clients that have worked historically, very closely with us, already select us to do business with them in clinical research. So, we have had meaningful wins there. We are also seeing some really interesting momentum in some of the smaller companies, well, so it\u2019s not just the large ones. But that concept of leveraging the existing relationships and the trusted partner status is working really well. And I think it was really cool that we were able to increase our synergy outlook by $100 million back in May, really just at that point was just six months after the close. I mean it\u2019s a big number. And the team is not stopping there. They are focused on closing business, building a very large authorizations backlog and growing the business incredibly strongly for the long-term. So, I think it\u2019s very positive. And we have earned a lot of trust over many years, and we are going to help our customers develop their medicines and do that cost effectively and rapidly so that they can really benefit patients. So, it\u2019s a very exciting time in terms of our clinical research momentum.\nMatt Sykes: Great. That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks. And then just one last question. Just any commentary on demand in the European region? Just give us some of the challenges your customers may be facing there. Have you seen any change in demand from customers across your business within Europe?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. So, Europe actually had a good quarter, right. And it\u2019s so to say that with down double digits. And effectively, we had a very significant COVID-19 testing comparison. So, embedded under that, the core business grew very strongly, actually. So, the demand has been good, and we saw really good market conditions in bioproduction, the research and safety market channel will be examples business did really well in Europe. So, what I saw in Q2 was strong. There is obviously lots of challenges in Europe. When we put that sentence, it\u2019s not a Thermo Fisher comment or an industry comment with pressures on energy prices and certainly, lots of challenges with the war in Ukraine. I think Europe will clearly be lumpy from a global economy perspective. But given our mix of business, which is very similar to the company average, we have a very large pharma biotech presence in Europe. And when you take out the COVID testing, it represents a little under 20% of our revenue. I think we will navigate that well.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. You may proceed.\nDan Arias: Good morning guys. Thank you. Stephen, maybe just back on the pricing topic.\nMarc Casper: Good morning.\nDan Arias: Hey guys. How much of the pricing plan that you have for the year has been implemented at this point? Can we think about sort of a percentage of the portfolio where you have successfully pushed an increase through versus what might be left for the back half?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, Dan, thanks for the question. So, we have been very active on pricing from midway through last year. So, it\u2019s not just a this year thing. And we are being appropriately adjusting as we have seeing the impacts of inflation change. And as Marc mentioned before, it\u2019s kind of how do you bring our customers with us at the same time. So, we are pricing appropriately, given the economic challenges that are around and I think appropriately navigating. So, I think about that, we are going to be dynamic as we go forward. So, we will figure out what the markets look like, what the inflation looks like and adjust appropriately as we think about the second half of this year and then going into 2023. So, it\u2019s kind of a constant work in process is the way I view it. The teams have actually done a very good job so far, and we will continue to navigate that way.\nDan Arias: Okay. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, maybe, Marc, on your follow-up to Jack\u2019s question on sort of the end market pie chart. How does the \u2013 I am curious how the Applied Science business looks for you at this point? And would you draw any distinction between the growth that you are seeing or that you think you will see for industrial versus Applied, just knowing that those two tend to get lumped together a lot. I mean do you think decoupling those do is a useful thing in all to do?\nMarc Casper: Again, in terms of the industrial and Applied, we obviously continue to see good momentum. We have a good position in serving semiconductor materials science. Those are \u2013 have been strong. The Applied markets funding has been fine. So, that sector continues to be good. There is obviously global macroeconomic concerns, but generally, things continue to be strong. And we do have a different mix than we were much smaller in terms of the percentage of the total is so a different mix. We have more raw material science mix than we did back in the last recession.\nDan Arias: Yes. Okay.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. You may proceed.\nMarc Casper: Puneet, good morning.\nPuneet Souda: Hi Stephen and Marc. Thanks Marc and congrats on the quarter. Just two brief questions for me. First one on analytical technologies, that was obviously very strong in the quarter, 13% growth. I think in last quarter, you did 12%. You pointed to a strong backlog going into the quarter as well. So, just wondering sort of how sustainable is that into the second half, given that these are instruments and not sort of consumables and services that you have highlighted as being a larger part of the business. But \u2013 and anything on the analytical instruments you could share on this strength of maybe potentially continuing into 2023, given the backlog or not would be really helpful.\nMarc Casper: So, Puneet, we had very strong performance in the quarter. Bookings were very strong as well. So, that gives us \u2013 that\u2019s encouraging in the second half. We also have a very large backlog, right. So, that also gives us some visibility to the second half as well, it gives us the confidence in the very strong outlook we have for the year from a core perspective. So, the signs are very good. And we are launching some amazing technology. That makes a huge difference. Like ASMS this year, I give obviously a deeper dive than normal, really affecting the workflow across a number of key applications for mass spectrometry, fantastic in terms of the feedback and momentum in the business. The same thing is true in our electron microscopy business is very strong. So, I think we are very well positioned going forward there.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Okay. And then, Marc, a high-level question for you, a bigger important question we get from sort of investors around capacity expansion. I mean Thermo has expanded capacity across multiple business lines and across PPD as well as single-use sites and agreement with Moderna and such. Are these sites in production capacity sort of fully operational sort of in 2022 timeframe and delivering to the level that you expect them to deliver, or this is more of a 2023 or 2024 timeframe when you see them coming fully online, because obviously it requires hiring of folks and getting the full facility fully ramped up. So, asking that because we get questions around capacity expansion and lower capacity. But on the flip side, when I look at it, I mean this will generate meaningfully higher revenue for you when the capacity comes online fully. So, just wondering how to think about that in like the 11% guide that you have today and the 7% to 9% longer term? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Puneet, thanks for the question. So, we picked a couple of really specific examples this quarter to highlight. I picked the example of Grand Island and Geel. And those capacity expansions or demand has been so strong for so long that we need to expand our capacity just to be able to support our future growth, right. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a different type of example, which is you deliver great results year-in, year-out, at some point, you expand your network to facilitate the gross strategy. Other of the expansions have a little more just adding new capabilities. They have been coming online this year and will continue to come online next year. So, it\u2019s a mix. And it\u2019s exciting in terms of in \u2013 we have really \u2013 we brought on new capacity in our self to finish. That was really the enabling the Moderna relationship expansion outside of COVID and that\u2019s really a 2023 example. And we have a number of other examples like single-use technology that we will be bringing online and we will continue to bring them on. So, it\u2019s a mix, but we feel good about the blend of investments and how they will fuel our growth strategy going forward.\nRafael Tejada: Great. Thanks Puneet. Operator, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Absolutely. The next question and final question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nTejas Savant: Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I will sneak in a two-parter here at the end. Beyond just the translational headwind from FX, Marc, do you see any signs that the strength of the dollar is beginning to weigh on customer minds, specifically in Europe and Japan? And then, Stephen, on the quarter-over-quarter sort of dip in gross margins roughly about 430 bps or so. Can you just help parse out what that bridge looks like between the COVID wind down versus FX versus other dynamics? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: So, on the FX and customer impact, the movements have been very rapid and relatively recently. So, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of customer discussion, it\u2019s really about where the rate is going to settle. And it\u2019s also going to depend a lot on what the alternatives are. If everybody is a U.S. based cost company, then it is what it is. If you have different where are we producing, where others producing and get into some of those dynamics. So far, it\u2019s been a non-issue. And we have dealt with this. The fact that I pulled out a playbook from what we had in the years past where we had rapid moves in the rates and we know how to navigate that environment a lot. Steve?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, on the gross margin, the gross margin came in exactly where I thought it would, so kind of in line with our expectations. I think that on a year-over-year basis, I think a lot of people are missing the impact of PPD. It\u2019s just under a 400 basis point impact on margin profile. And the rest really since the change both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year related to the mix in business in terms of testing versus other core and an element of pricing to offset inflation that also puts a little bit of pressure on margins so the other piece to it.\nMarc Casper: Great. Thanks Tejas.\nTejas Savant: Thanks Steve.\nMarc Casper: Let me wrap up. So, as you have heard this morning, really an excellent first half of the year. We are on track to deliver another outstanding year with great momentum and that sets us up for a very bright future. As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share, and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets. From a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we had assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2 and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single-digits, Europe declined in the low double-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low double-digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter. You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we are making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $394 million in Q2, approximately $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $115 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we are referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business and that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment. So, moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we are making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. This is offset by lower COVD-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%. Organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%. During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations. During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segment, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also still the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three elements: a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. Let me provide you some color on each of these elements. So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business, this reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance. As I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raised the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risked approach to the outlook. In terms of FX, we've incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind on of $1.25 billion on revenue, up 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance. In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up the $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX. We now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. So to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI business system execution. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year. We're assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. So Patrick, in terms of the setup on pricing, then back to kind of a normal year for us, about 0.5% to 1 percentage point of net price across the whole business. And for the first half of the year, we've been running kind of slightly north of double the high end of that range. And the additional pricing we put in place is really to offset higher inflation that we're seeing largely energy costs in Europe as we think about the change in guidance. And that change in guidance is really slightly higher revenue and no impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS, but a little pressure on margin, which is the reason why the overall margin came down in the guidance from the last guidance. But that's kind of active management of the pricing to offset the additional inflation. Yes. I think looking at FX rates, if they stayed the same as they are now, that will be kind of an additional year-over-year headwind next year, about $600 million, about $0.40 of adjusted EPS. And I think about the mix of currencies and where currencies have changed. Obviously, that could change as we go through the year, but something to watch out for in corporate. Yes, Dan, thanks for the question. So, we have been very active on pricing from midway through last year. So, it's not just a this year thing. And we are being appropriately adjusting as we have seeing the impacts of inflation change. And as Marc mentioned before, it's kind of how do you bring our customers with us at the same time. So, we are pricing appropriately, given the economic challenges that are around and I think appropriately navigating. So, I think about that, we are going to be dynamic as we go forward. So, we will figure out what the markets look like, what the inflation looks like and adjust appropriately as we think about the second half of this year and then going into 2023. So, it's kind of a constant work in process is the way I view it. The teams have actually done a very good job so far, and we will continue to navigate that way. Yes. So, on the gross margin, the gross margin came in exactly where I thought it would, so kind of in line with our expectations. I think that on a year-over-year basis, I think a lot of people are missing the impact of PPD. It's just under a 400 basis point impact on margin profile. And the rest really since the change both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year related to the mix in business in terms of testing versus other core and an element of pricing to offset inflation that also puts a little bit of pressure on margins so the other piece to it."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses. As I reflect on the quarter, I am very proud of the team's great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business. Our ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. You will see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year. So, let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share. Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. We are continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we have earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low double-digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology. During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers' COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as I reflect on this quarter's performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by three factors: the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we have made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns. Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I will start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I will highlight a few of these. We have an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers' work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme automated sample prep platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating a range of previously manual steps. We also launched the cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDO software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies. In addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics to help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company. Turning to our high growth and emerging markets, we are really thrilled with our team's progress. You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind, because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I am so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers, and our support for local COVID-19 testing. So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. Our capabilities enable our customers' ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities. Let me share a couple of examples. In our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers' research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we have been delivering. I have had the opportunity to visit both sides a number of times and it's really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that's driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we are supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition. Now, turning to capital deployment, I'd like to share some of the other steps we have taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We are very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth. In May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization and I am so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward. The combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers and we are seeing strong momentum in the business. All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of the deal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. Turning now to an update to our ESG initiatives, we released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we are continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It's great to see the progress detailed in the report and also reflecting the progress we have made through our commitment to ESG over many years. For this quarter, I will highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy is sold at onsite rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels. We are also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals which will ultimately have an impact across our value chain. As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward. Now, I'd like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021 and we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share. This higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter. Our outstanding results in Q2 highlight the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI business system and our extraordinary team. Our business is performing very well and we are gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns. We are really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Hi, Jack. Good morning. Yes. So Jack, I guess the first thing is business performing extraordinarily well, right? We have broad-based strength. As I look at the companies that have reported, we've done very well from a top line perspective. So I feel good about how we're performing. Bookings performance was very good. So if I think about what are we seeing in our business, we're seeing very strong strength, right? In terms of the macro, obviously, when you read the papers or wherever information source, lots and lots of challenges in the world. And in the last quarter, we articulated some of them and how we factored some of that into the thinking for our outlook. And so what do we think about sensitivity? This company is incredibly well positioned to navigate whatever the world throws at us, right? And the industry in and of itself is attractive as well as sensitive economically than many. We are very well positioned within it, and we have tremendous momentum. When I think about \u2013 if we see a downturn, and we're not seeing the signs of one, but it doesn't mean that there won't be one. We have the benefit of a track record of dynamic of navigating dynamic times and exiting those periods really an incredibly strong industry leader. We benefit from an experienced management team, an incredible team around the world, a proven growth strategy in a PPI business system, which gives us great operational discipline. As you know, we've taken a number of actions over the last few years to strengthen our position in the end markets we serve. And today, relative to the recession and the great financial crisis, we have less industrial exposure. As a reminder, about 30% of our revenue going into the last recession was industrial. Today, it's about 13%. And Pharma and Biotech is much larger, and that has been the least economically sensitive of the end markets, and that represents just under 60% of our revenue. And when I think about our mix, we're more service and consumables oriented than we were then. Then, it was 65% of our revenue. Today, it's 82% of our revenue. So the company is performing well. Our end markets are good, and we will manage through whatever the world throws at us. And you see that in the results, right? You see that in the \u2013 FX got meaningfully more challenging for all global companies, and we're able to power through that and deliver an increase in our guidance. Yes. So from a capital deployment perspective, I really wanted to do the deeper dive on the progress of PPD, and we did a large acquisition in December, right? And the first thing we have to demonstrate is that we're great owners and operators of the businesses that are part of the family, and that's always our number one priority, and that business has performed great. And we have an active pipeline. And when I think about how valuations have come in many sectors that creates opportunities, right? So we're actively engaged as we always are and we're well positioned to capitalize on the M&A opportunities that will be out there in the landscape. So thank you, Jack. Patrick, good morning, thanks for the questions. So, when I think about bioprocessing, I always like to frame it in the context of how we serve former biotech, right? The market will level up, it's very attractive. We have a leading presence, and we're really well positioned to serve those customer base. And you've seen us deliver really strong growth. When I think about production, right, or bioproduction, as a reminder, we have two major activities that we have within our company. We have our bioproduction business, which is the leading presence in cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as our pharma services business, which is both drug substance and drug product for biologics. And you see us play with the monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, cell therapy, plasmid, sterile fill, finish all part of that. So it's a large portion of our total presence in serving pharma biotech. Outstanding quarter, right, when I look at \u2013 and that was both across the services business and bioproduction. When I look at how others have done and reported, I feel very, very good about our performance. And the outlook here is really positive. When I think about your question on the COVID vaccine therapies, our outlook for the year is $1.5 billion. That's the same as it was in Q1. We did just over $400 million of revenue in Q2, which was right in line with our expectations. It brings us to a little bit over $900 million at the halfway point of the year. So we feel good about our role in supporting our customers' activities in vaccines and therapies. That's part of our core revenue growth. So over time, when there is less demand for those capabilities, we will transition that well to other applications, which we do all the time. I'll start with the customer comments, and Stephen will go through his thoughts. We're incredibly transparent with our customers and a partner to enable their success. So we've had very constructive discussions, and we've operated with transparency and has allowed us to get an appropriate level of pricing. Thanks, Patrick. Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the 13% core growth \u2013 the 14% core growth for the first half, really strong momentum in the business and very broad-based, right? So that's exciting. And when I look at how the industry is reporting, we're faring very well. So I'm proud of the team's efforts. So some of the highlights, geographically, the team is doing incredibly good job in China. So that's one lens. End market lens, pharma biotech going incredibly quickly, right, with mid-teens growth. So that's another of lens. And then the way you framed it, from the businesses perspective, analytical instruments is doing very well. It's going to see the 13% growth in the segment, great performance in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our channel is performing well, pharma services. And then while it doesn't it's in the core. Our PPD acquisition has performed very well. We've obviously had the benefit of seeing a couple of industry participants report and that business is going well. And to be candid, it's pretty much broad-based cost business. I haven't mentioned either. It's not the \u2013 I didn't say something to us not doing well. The team is really humming right now. So, Mike, I guess a few thoughts on 2023, right. And obviously, I am looking forward \u2013 I am actually doing it every day, it's not that. But when we get to January, I will be looking forward to giving you the \u2013 give you the update on sort of what we think for the year, right, so in the details. What we don't know now, right. And it's just nobody knows is what's the macro environment, right. Is it \u2013 was it like the first half of this year, well, phenomenal, right, or is it different, and so we will appropriately set the context for 2023, when we get there. But I think there are a couple of things that are worth saying at this point in time to at least help you think about it. One is the core business, right. It's going to be large, right. We are growing the business faster this year than we had outlined in the long-term model. So, I mean the jumping off point in 2023 is we are going to have a bigger business. And that's core that drives earnings power and all of those things. We will have an appropriate growth range based on how we see the world at that point in time. We will figure that out as it gets closer. And then Stephen might \u2013 do you want to comment on FX and because I know that the movements have been enormous, and you might want to frame how to think about that for next year. But I feel great about how the core business performed. Yes. And Mike, when I think about the 7% to 9% growth, that's the long-term sort of average we worked through. So, it can vary in a given year, as this year, obviously, is above that, it can be within and it can be different, just depends on the measure we use is, are we delivering really good performance, right. And it's going to be in the context of what's the environment. So, that's going to wait until January. Thanks for the questions. Yes. So \u2013 when I think about the business in China, the team really did an excellent job I think really difficult circumstances. They basically had a month in the Shanghai region to basically get the business to really incredible performance in June. So, I am very proud of that. We had good growth in the core business, much better than we expected. And a nice chunk of the overdrive in COVID testing was in supporting the local activities. So, we did a really good job there. We don't sell our assays there, but we do sell our instruments and in our reagents to support local demand. So, we had strong core growth and a meaningful response in China, actually larger than we typically have in China for COVID testing. The way I think about the outlook is it should be a good market in the second half of the year. I have no doubt there will be some level of COVID disruption. What that will be, when it will be, where it will be, hard to know. But just given the zero COVID policies, there will be bumps on the road. But the team knows how to navigate that, and I feel like we will get through that period effectively. And there could be some headwinds here or there, but nothing that we see at this point in time in China. It looks very strong. Yes. So Rachel, thanks for the question. Pharma market has been very strong. One of the questions because as our investors and analysts ask the question. I asked the team about are there patterns, trends, anything that is jumping out. And it's actually been broad-based strength, right. We are seeing good growth in the various sub-segments within the customer base. So, I feel like the momentum is strong. Orders were strong. There is always company-specific challenges right. There will be companies that have bad data, bad report out or a company that's going to a cat and whatever [ph]. And we help those companies navigate those times. We help them drive productivity and accelerate innovation, and those things. But we continue to see strong momentum in pharma and biotech. Thanks for the questions. So, Matt, thanks for the question. One of the things that's just been phenomenal is the speed at which we have been able to get meaningful authorizations that clearly synergy work, meaning the benefits of bringing the combination together and we have had several of the larger clients that have worked historically, very closely with us, already select us to do business with them in clinical research. So, we have had meaningful wins there. We are also seeing some really interesting momentum in some of the smaller companies, well, so it's not just the large ones. But that concept of leveraging the existing relationships and the trusted partner status is working really well. And I think it was really cool that we were able to increase our synergy outlook by $100 million back in May, really just at that point was just six months after the close. I mean it's a big number. And the team is not stopping there. They are focused on closing business, building a very large authorizations backlog and growing the business incredibly strongly for the long-term. So, I think it's very positive. And we have earned a lot of trust over many years, and we are going to help our customers develop their medicines and do that cost effectively and rapidly so that they can really benefit patients. So, it's a very exciting time in terms of our clinical research momentum. Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. So, Europe actually had a good quarter, right. And it's so to say that with down double digits. And effectively, we had a very significant COVID-19 testing comparison. So, embedded under that, the core business grew very strongly, actually. So, the demand has been good, and we saw really good market conditions in bioproduction, the research and safety market channel will be examples business did really well in Europe. So, what I saw in Q2 was strong. There is obviously lots of challenges in Europe. When we put that sentence, it's not a Thermo Fisher comment or an industry comment with pressures on energy prices and certainly, lots of challenges with the war in Ukraine. I think Europe will clearly be lumpy from a global economy perspective. But given our mix of business, which is very similar to the company average, we have a very large pharma biotech presence in Europe. And when you take out the COVID testing, it represents a little under 20% of our revenue. I think we will navigate that well. Good morning. Again, in terms of the industrial and Applied, we obviously continue to see good momentum. We have a good position in serving semiconductor materials science. Those are \u2013 have been strong. The Applied markets funding has been fine. So, that sector continues to be good. There is obviously global macroeconomic concerns, but generally, things continue to be strong. And we do have a different mix than we were much smaller in terms of the percentage of the total is so a different mix. We have more raw material science mix than we did back in the last recession. Thanks Dan. Puneet, good morning. So, Puneet, we had very strong performance in the quarter. Bookings were very strong as well. So, that gives us \u2013 that's encouraging in the second half. We also have a very large backlog, right. So, that also gives us some visibility to the second half as well, it gives us the confidence in the very strong outlook we have for the year from a core perspective. So, the signs are very good. And we are launching some amazing technology. That makes a huge difference. Like ASMS this year, I give obviously a deeper dive than normal, really affecting the workflow across a number of key applications for mass spectrometry, fantastic in terms of the feedback and momentum in the business. The same thing is true in our electron microscopy business is very strong. So, I think we are very well positioned going forward there. Puneet, thanks for the question. So, we picked a couple of really specific examples this quarter to highlight. I picked the example of Grand Island and Geel. And those capacity expansions or demand has been so strong for so long that we need to expand our capacity just to be able to support our future growth, right. It's just \u2013 it's a different type of example, which is you deliver great results year-in, year-out, at some point, you expand your network to facilitate the gross strategy. Other of the expansions have a little more just adding new capabilities. They have been coming online this year and will continue to come online next year. So, it's a mix. And it's exciting in terms of in \u2013 we have really \u2013 we brought on new capacity in our self to finish. That was really the enabling the Moderna relationship expansion outside of COVID and that's really a 2023 example. And we have a number of other examples like single-use technology that we will be bringing online and we will continue to bring them on. So, it's a mix, but we feel good about the blend of investments and how they will fuel our growth strategy going forward. So, on the FX and customer impact, the movements have been very rapid and relatively recently. So, there hasn't been a lot of customer discussion, it's really about where the rate is going to settle. And it's also going to depend a lot on what the alternatives are. If everybody is a U.S. based cost company, then it is what it is. If you have different where are we producing, where others producing and get into some of those dynamics. So far, it's been a non-issue. And we have dealt with this. The fact that I pulled out a playbook from what we had in the years past where we had rapid moves in the rates and we know how to navigate that environment a lot. Steve? Great. Thanks Tejas. Let me wrap up. So, as you have heard this morning, really an excellent first half of the year. We are on track to deliver another outstanding year with great momentum and that sets us up for a very bright future. As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone."

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call.  As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. That strength is broad based, including PPD, our clinical research business, where the integration is going smoothly and we're even more excited about the opportunities we have to further enable the success of our pharma and biotech customers. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our business. Our continued success as the result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system, which continues to be a differentiator for us. It enables our team to further strengthen our company by finding a better way every day. When I think about the macro events much has changed since the start of the year. The war Ukraine, rising inflation, COVID lockdowns in China. What hasn't changed is our ability to navigate a dynamic landscape and deliver exceptional performance. You'll see that in our first quarter results and outlook for the year. So let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 19% year-over-year $11.82 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $3.45 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 29.2%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $7.25 per share. Let me now give you to color on the performance by our end markets. Building on the momentum from 2021 we delivered excellent performance to start the year. Our outstanding results this quarter were due to our team\u2019s strong execution, good market conditions, and share gain. We also had meaningful contribution from COVID-19 testing as we continue to support our customers\u2019 needs. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had another outstanding quarter of performance delivering growth in the mid-teens. We broad base strength in this end market, as our customers value our trusted partner status. In the academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digit during the quarter, with good growth in biosciences, electron microscopy, and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens during the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses. Electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry and chemical analysis, as well as in the research and safety market channel.  And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, Q1 revenue declined in the mid-teens. In the core business we saw strong growth in clinical diagnostics, transplant diagnostics, and the healthcare market channel. During the quarter the team executed really well to support COVID-19 testing needs. Let me now provide an update in the progress we made in Q1, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, a commitment to high impact innovation, scale in the high growth and emerging markets and a unique value proposition to our customers. We made great progress in the first quarter, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter for high-impact innovation, as we launched a number of new products that will help our customers break new ground in our important work. A few of the highlights. In our genetic sciences business, we launched our Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Flex Series genetic analyzer to improve clinical research and advanced scientific discovery. In Analytical Instruments, we launched four new Gas Chromatography and GCMS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. This includes the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph, which incorporates enhanced automation for instrument health monitoring, and offers flexibility for customers to optimize their workflow. In bioproduction, we launched the Gibco CTS Xenon Electroporation system for the efficient delivery of genetic material into cells, as part of cell therapy manufacturing. In addition, we signed an agreement with precision diagnostic company Oncocyte, to develop two new assays for our Ion Torrent Genexus System to improve cancer tumor profiling, and advanced precision medicine. This is just a small sampling of the outstanding innovation going on across our company, enabling our customer success and strengthening our position as the world leader in serving science. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We had strong performance in these markets, including China, which grew double-digits in the quarter. Our Analytical Instruments business are being used around the world to advance scientific research, including the high growth and emerging markets. For example, in Beijing, the National Institute of Biological Sciences is using our mass spectrometers to accelerate their research in structural biology. And in Korea, our electron microscopes are enabling researchers at Pusan National University to establish a bio imaging center to accelerate virus research. Now turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our unique customer value proposition. We continue to enhance our capabilities, so we can be an even stronger partner and industry leader. To help our customers advance cell and gene therapies we opened a new bio repository in Vacaville, California. This facility will provide specialized biological sample storage and cell therapy logistics. In bioproduction our network expansion is going well. During the quarter, we brought on additional capacity online for single use bio process containers and cell culture media. Reflecting our trusted partner status with pharma and biotech customers, we entered a 15-year strategic collaboration agreement with Moderna to establish large scale U.S. manufacturing of mRNA-based vaccine and therapies. Under this agreement, we'll provide dedicated capacity for a range of aseptic fill-finish services, along with inspection labeling and final packaging. During the quarter, I had the chance to visit our Greenville, North Carolina campus, where we've invested significantly over the past couple of years to expand our capacity and capabilities. And the new building that will support Moderna\u2019s pipeline, it's truly impressive. Now, turning to capital deployment. I'd like to share some of the other steps we've taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our discipline capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Given this was the first a full quarter of contribution from PPD, our new clinical research business, I'd like to update you on our progress. The business is performing very well and running ahead of the deal model, the strong start and outlook for the year is allowing us to increase our expectations for the business. Stephen will cover these details in his remarks. In terms of the integration, it's going very smoothly. Our customers are seeing the value of the combination, and we have realized our first commercial synergies securing new authorizations from pharma and biotech customers who value the combination of our capabilities, this bodes well for our long-term revenue synergies. To further fuel growth and support increasing demand from our biopharma customers, we've also invested to expand our clinical research operations in Richmond, Virginia. Finally, I've been super impressed with the team, as I've visited different sites. And together we're taking the business to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher to become an even stronger partner for our customers. As I mentioned on our last call, we closed on PeproTech, a leading provider of bioscience reagents late last year. I'm pleased to note that that business is also a great start and the integration is going incredibly well. During Q1, we completed a small bolt-on deal in analytical instruments to enhance our materials and structural analysis offering for our customers. And during the quarter, we also returned significant capitals for our shareholders. We purchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 15%. Turning now to a brief update on our ESG initiatives. We marked a significant milestone during the first quarter, exceeding one million readily recyclable paper coolers ship to transport coal chain products without the use of traditional polystyrene foam coolers. This builds on our commitment to environmental stewardship and enabling broad adoption of sustainable solutions. In addition, we recently announced our partnership with the University of California in San Diego to advance an innovation, sustainability and talent development. This 10-year partnership will establish a network tech of technology centers focused on accelerating collaborative research and advancing innovations in a range of scientific fields. It will also accelerate educational opportunities, especially for under resource students, by engaging in joint stem and community outreach programs and supporting curriculum development, scholarships, fellowships, career mentoring, and recruitment Before covering guidance. I'd like to end my comments with a reflection on the events that are impacting our colleagues and the world at large. As always our top priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're supporting our colleagues, displaced from Ukraine with a variety of needs and together with our colleagues globally, we've made substantial donations to relief organizations, responding in Ukraine and enabling safe-haven countries. In China, where many of our colleagues are facing lengthy lockdowns and disruption in daily life due to the pandemic. We're providing care packages to residents in Shanghai who have faced limited food supplies. We're also recognize that inflation is challenging for our team, and we're going to provide a special payment this summer to our colleagues. Now, I'd like to review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion, which would result in 8% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 per share. This guidance factors in are excellent Q1, includes a very strong core business outlook for the remainder of the year. And it incorporates the expected impact of the recent macroeconomic dynamics. Our Q1 results and our increased guide for the year reflects, how well the team is navigating these dynamic times. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our outstanding results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. Our business is performing very well and we\u2019re gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns, and we're really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with an excellent Q1. In the quarter, we delivered 16% core organic growth, $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue, $7.25 for adjusted earnings per share, and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q1 was just over $1 billion higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $700 million driven by a very strong start of the year for the core business and just under $400 million from testing. The strength of the core was brought-based across businesses and markets and geographies. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull through on this revenue and adjusted EPS for Q1 was $0.84 higher than included in our previous guidance. So broad-based beat to start the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $7.25 of adjusted EPS in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.61 down 5% versus the prior year. On the top line, a Q1 reported revenue grew 19% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 16% and as I mentioned, we delivered $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America grew in the low-single digits. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-teens, with China growing in the low-double digits. And rest of the world declined in low-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, 620 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Adjusted operating margins came in slightly higher than we'd have anticipated in our prior guidance for Q1 reflecting how well our growth strategy and PPI business system enables us to manage dynamic times. We executed strong pricing realization, productivity and volume leveraging the core business enabling us to appropriately address higher inflation, and this was more than offset by the expected impacts of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and the impact of strategic investments including continued investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 47.5%, 660 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.2% of revenue, a decrease of 20 basis points versus Q1 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q1 representing growth of 14% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the lines of the quarter, our net interest expense was $118 million, $5 million higher than Q1 last year largely due to acquisition financing activities. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.1%. This was a 190 basis points lower than Q1 last year, driven by a tax planning initiative. Average diluted shares with $395 million in Q1, approximately $3 million lower year-over-year driven by share purchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system enables to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong top line performance. Cash flow from operating activities in Q1 was $2.2 billion, and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are progressing well and this quarter's net capital expenditures with $640 million. In January we returned $2 billion of the capital to shareholders through buybacks. Also during the quarter we increased our dividend by 15%. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.8 billion in cash and $33.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and 2.4 times on net debt basis. And concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC with 18% reflecting the strong returns on investments that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance about four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as previously mentioned we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving onto the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment increased 1% and organic revenue was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1 we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was upset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income and Life Science Solutions decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 51.4% down to 280 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity that was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments Segment reported revenue increased 9% in Q1 and organic growth was 12%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in a segment increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 19.8% up 20 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity, that was offset by strategic investments we're making across this segment. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1 reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue declined 7%. In the quarter, we saw a strong underlying growth in our healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 17% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9% down 260 basis points from the prior year. In Q1, we drove strong productivity. This was more than offset by business mix and the strategic investments in the segment. And finally in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, in Q1 reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic growth was 6%. During Q1, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and the laboratory products, businesses. PPD, our clinical research business is performing very well. And during the quarter, it grew a few points above the company average core organic growth rate. It contributed $1.66 billion of revenue to the segment in the quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 17% and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, which is 340 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments and business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance, as Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. And on the bottom line, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 for the year. So very strong outlook, particularly as it also factors in the notable macro developments that occurred following our last earnings call in February. Our team continues to do an excellent job navigating through a fluid macroeconomic environment to help us deliver outstanding results, reflecting the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of the PPI Business System to operate with speed at scale. So, let me get into the details of the guidance raise, in terms of revenue there are three elements driving the raising guidance, $350 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue for the year, a $200 million decrease due to the change in FX rates and a $300 million increase in the outlook for the core business. The core revenue raise incorporates a $350 million headwinds from the conflict in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China. And we chose to de-risk $600 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in the outlook, offsetting it with other core revenue. Our guidance now assumes $1.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue in total for 2022. Incorporating both of these and still being able to raise the full year outlook for the core shows that the business is performing very well. And as I mentioned previously, we're increasing the core organic growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. In terms of like COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, continuing the same de-risk approach to guidance as there a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $2.1 billion of testing revenue in 2022, which represents the $1.68 billion delivered in Q1, $225 million in Q2. And then an assumed endemic run rate level of a $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case? We're well positioned to support customer needs as we did in Q1 and we'll flow these benefits through our P&L, but for now we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risk approach to the outlook. In terms of profitability, we expected to deliver $90 million more adjusted operating income up to $450 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull through on the additional revenue, partially offset by a $150 million of additional compensation to our colleagues to help them with the temporary impacts of insulation. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 from $22.43 to $22.65 further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. PPD our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.7 billion in 2022 in revenue, which represents 11% core organic growth on a full year basis for this business, up three percentage points from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to deliver just over a $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022 and contribute a $1.98 to adjusted EPS in the year up $0.08 from our prior guidance. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $700 million on revenue, or 1.8% and $0.54 on adjusted EPS. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $490 million for the year. We now expect an adjusted income tax rate of 13.1% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guide driven by the improved earnings outlook. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. A guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital to return to shareholders through dividends. And we now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling, revenue dollars for the remainder of the year they're expected to be fairly linear with Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. Core organic growth for Q2 is expected to be lower than Q3 and Q4 due to an estimated 200 basis point impact of lockdowns in China. And in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we expect Q2 as a percentage of the full year to be just slightly lower than the comparable periods last year. To conclude we'd live an excellent start to the year, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well. My question \u2013 are on the Biopharma side. First question on clinical research so PPD growing over 20%, that's well above historical levels and what peers have been reporting so far. Just what is driving the acceleration? Can you comment on industry funding and your ability to gain share?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. So our clinical research business, formally PPD off to a great start. As a reminder, the business had tremendous success in 2021 delivering great performance, great authorizations, even from especially after the announcement, just incredibly focused on great execution. Customers are excited about the potential and that momentum continued into Q1. Very strong performance on revenue and really good growth and authorizations. As I look at what's going on in the industry and look at some of the other companies that have reported, our results look favorable to the results that we saw. So we feel good about that, as an external reference point. And the switch strength within PPD was broad based across the different customer types, the funding environment, it was actually a great start to the year. Integration's gone really well. We feel good about that, and I'm really excited that commercial team has secured our first wins that are what I would call synergy related in the form of new authorization. So really a very cool start to the year, and we're excited about what the potential holds for our clinical research business.\nJack Meehan: Great. And as a second question, I wanted to square the new $1.5 billion target for the COVID vaccines and therapies with your ability to raise the core growth overall. So, if I look at the Patheon and bioprocessing businesses are they still growing high single digit plus is the COVID handoff taking place. And kind of, off that just, can you comment on how changing doses per vial and the new Moderna strategic relationship might factor into this?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so Jack thanks. It's a great question. We made a decision on the guidance on vaccines and therapies, actually just because the number of questions we were getting from investors relative to our enterprise value and the sort of net present value of the company was disproportionate, right? So, we just basically said, we had a really good start on vaccines and therapies for the year. We did just under $500 million of revenue, which was what we expected to do. The $2.1 billion that we put in the original guidance of vaccine therapy related revenue is actually still a number that can be achieved. I call it at the high end of the range. And as you know, we're involved in so many of the programs, we're involved in the vaccine programs and the therapy programs we're involved in the drug substance and the drug product. We're involved in the enabling technology. So it's across many of our different capabilities and we feel good about it. We chose to effectively reduce the number in the, sort of in the target because the core business is performing so well that we just wanted to take the dialogue really off the table, as you know the capacity that makes these products and provides the enabling technologies is truly repurposable to other customers and to other products within the biologic field. So, we're very encouraged by that. And then to your question, we are expecting very strong growth for our pharma services and our bioproduction business in 2022 and beyond. So Jack thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Marc, maybe on the China piece, I know Stephen touched on a 200 bit headwind for 2Q. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there, which businesses are being affected more than others? Obviously we're seeing Beijing entering the conversation this week, I guess, what have you guys assumed there in terms of escalations or what's going to happen. And then again are certain businesses poised to recover more quickly than others. Just curious your perspective there.\nMarc Casper: Patrick, thanks for the question. So, the team really did an excellent job in Q1 navigating the lockdowns as started towards the end of the quarter to deliver double-digit growth and to really work with the government to be able to supply the critical products that we provide to the customer base there, even in difficult circumstances. Very impressive. What our assumption is actually fairly straightforward. We're looking at the back half of the year that Q3 and Q4 are normal in China, back to strong growth. And as you know, the business there rebounded super quickly after the Q1 of 2020 disruption. So the economy is there is quite resilient. Our assumption is in this quarter, there's a couple points of headwind. We're baking into the numbers because the number of the customers are closed. Academic institutions in Shanghai would be closed so that, it'll take, a period of time for that to rebound and as activity ramps back up. So that's how we're thinking about it in terms of the quarter. And we were able to fully bake that into our guidance and Stephen in the revenue phasing, views, try to make it clearer that what our outlook is for Q2, which is still quite good, but feels a little bit of that pressure and then Q3, Q4 picks up from there.\nPatrick Donnelly: Sure. That's helpful. Thanks Marc. And then maybe just another one on the bioprocessing vaccine piece, appreciate the transparency in terms of what that looks like this year? Obviously to your point, it's a big investor focus even into 2023, is there a way to think of that $1.5 billion as we get into next year? I know you guys have rolled it into core and kind of thought, the rest of the bioprocessing business will mostly offset it. It's going to be a gradual decline. Has that thinking changed at all? Just wondering on your high-level perspective, how to think about that piece as we move forward. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Patrick, thanks for the follow-up on that. So, I would think about it, the following, the timing of the transition and what the long-term demand for COVID there are so many scenarios, it's very hard to say which quarter, which year exactly how things play out, right? Because the capacity is re-purposable we will move that over time. And in our long-term model that Stephen presented last September, it effectively reflects that that's all transitioned by the end of the model period. So that it was part of core. It doesn't affect the 7% to 9% long-term outlook. As I looked to 2023, I mean, as a reminder, we play a role in both therapies and vaccines. So, they are on different cycles and different scenarios, which is, I think, most scenarios have the pandemic existing in some endemic form next year. And therefore, therapy demand should exist with some level of consistency and vaccines is a wide range of out outcomes. Obviously the smaller, vial, the single use actually drives more revenue per thing. So, you have a lot of moving pieces. And our job is to manage all of that, manage the transition at the right timeframe and we will. I think the one piece of new information that, I think, is interesting is one of our customers, not in the top tier of the activity level within COVID, actually just repurposed its own commitments to other therapies and activities. So that was actually made that transition even smoother for a portion of it. And basically, in the future basically is taking the commitments and say, when they don't need COVID capacity, they're going to basically use it for other thing. So, hopefully all that color gives you a sense that we'll manage that over time and will continue to deliver strong growth as a company.\nPatrick Donnelly: Very helpful. Thanks Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nMarc Casper: Good morning.\nDerik De Bruin: I've got one model question and then I've got one big picture question. So, on the model, can you walk us through the gross margin progression in 2022? We see things seems to continually sort of miss model the gross margin. Can you help us walk us through and understand the FX myths and inflation through headwinds are going through?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, so Derik so let's think about the gross margins this quarter kind of another 47.5% level be slightly lower for the remainder of the year and still in the year in that kind of mid-40s. And I think what people are not fully baking in is the impact of PPD. That has sizeable change to the overall company's gross margin when you factor that in. And then FX is a little bit of negative in terms of the margin profile. But it's really the impact of testing coming down and then the benefit of having PPD in the business. I think that's probably the thing that's missing the most.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. That's helpful. And I wanted ask about the Moderna agreement because it's really surprising to see 15-year agreement sitting in our space. It's just not really done. Can you talk about that in terms of like, what is sort of driving that and is there something you sort of see that you can do with other people in the biotech space? And you also mentioned some synergy wins with PPD, how should we think about that in the longer-term targets on PPD?\nMarc Casper: Yes, so, Derik, thanks for the question. So, as you know, we never really talk about specific customers unless a customer is announcing this on their own behalf, and then we're more than happy to make some high-level comments, right, because it's really, our job is to support our customers\u2019 activity. I think that our take is that we did a really good job of supporting our clients during the course of the pandemic across all of the different activities. And that enhanced our reputation, our trusted partner status with our customers. And as in the case of Moderna they had the opportunity to work with us and decided to leverage our capabilities in Greenville, North Carolina, and our expertise to support their future pipeline from a sterile fill finish perspective. And it's super exciting in terms of the capabilities of the things that we will support longer term from them there. We have many different models of how we work with our clients in our pharma services business. And it's our job to support them in the best way that they want. We do have what we call condo models, where customers have some dedicated capacity. We have the traditional fee-for-service models. And then we have some other innovative ones. The other public one obviously was announced a couple years ago, which was CSL, right, which is, we took over one of their facilities, we're going to be manufacturing one of their new therapies and they are expanding the collaboration with us. So, it's a long menu of options and our job is to help our customers navigate their future and be really valuable to them.\nRafael Tejada: Thanks Derik.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas please go ahead, your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hi guys. Good morning. And thanks for the time here. Mark, a question for you on pricing, you've spoken in the past about taking elevated pricing increases your perhaps 2x the normalized level in 2022. Can you just refresh that assumption for us in the context of the sharper inflation here? And philosophically, how do you think about the point at which you need to be a little bit careful about starting to impact customer demand perhaps more in some segments than others?\nMarc Casper: Yes, it's a great question, right. So, when we think about living and navigating through an inflationary environment, our team is doing a good job of managing productivity and managing cost and mitigating what can be mitigated. So, I'm very pleased with that. Our expectation for pricing is \u2013 and in normally as you know, it's a half point to a point of price that we get within our business. And this year we would expect that price would be about double the high end of that range or about two points of price within our outlook for the year. So, it's our job to support our customers, to explain the inflations and where we can offset it and where we need customers to support us. And those dialogues have been constructive and positive.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on PPD. Any color you can share on RFP flow, there has been a little bit of a focus on delays and cancellations, particularly among sort of midcap biotech customers here. Obviously, you had strong performance in the quarter, you are taking your numbers up for the deal. But just curious if you can pass out sort of any commentary on that specific segment of their customer base?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, when I look at the performance, I look at the pipeline, I look at the authorizations, which is the new wins. When I look at the revenue, when I cut it by the different types of customers, we had a really strong start to the year. When I look at, I read not all, but some of the different commentary, and the differing views out there my take is, is that there was nothing abnormal in cancellations in the quarter, there was no trend to any of that. And actually we are on track to deliver very strong results, but the 11% growth that we're looking at for this year is really impressive because last year we're spectacular, right? In terms of the growth that the business delivered. So against a challenging comp that's really, really encouraging, and authorization support that for this year, but also support the long-term expectations that this is a high single digit growth business. And when we drive, synergies, it can be better than that. So, super cool times, but obviously early.\nTejas Savant: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the Vijay Kumar [Evercore]. Vijay, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations in a really strong Q1 start. Maybe one on guidance here, perhaps for Stephen. I think your prior guidance call for high singles and that high singles was consistent across base vaccine and PPD [ph] just given, given a vaccine outlook is now I think down 15%, 20% versus last year. How much is the core, base going up and how much is PPD going up under the new guidance assumptions?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, Vijay, so outline in the prepared remarks, the strength of the PPD business is going up to 11% for the year. So that would be a strong contribution and can you characterize the vaccines and therapies, and then we're offsetting that all of that from vaccines therapy and it increasing our guidance. So the core business is increasing $350 million in the raise. So going up to 8% to 9% strong performance. And that's obviously taking into an account and that switching back in the therapies to core, and offsetting the impact of the macroeconomic implications in China and situation in Ukraine.\nVijay Kumar : That's helpful Stephen and Marc maybe one for you here. I know that the street is worried about the outlook just given the macro, the 16% core and Q1 versus a 13% comp. And we're looking at stock comp of close to 30%. I mean, these are really, really strong, and I understand pharma biotech, perhaps being strong but looks like all segments are on fire. Maybe just talk about end markets health of end markets, and when you think about the upcoming Analyst Day, what kind of approach should we expect from Thermo, will vaccines be get rest will it be the rest approach or any thoughts and what we can expect into the analyst? It will be helpful.\nMarc Casper: Yes. I mean, I can't wait until May 18. It'll be super cool. We're going to have it back in person. It'll be a great way to showcase our team and showcase the great things going on at the company. And we'll explain some of the stuff today in some more detail. And so it'll be very positive from that perspective. When I think about the business, right, we highlighted some of the macroeconomic dynamics, right? Because if you watch TV, you read the papers, you're on the internet, whatever it is that you get the external world, it's a bumpy time in the world, but when you get within our four walls right now, it is awesome. I mean, it is an amazing time of the company the momentum is huge. The customers are doing well, we are gaining markets share, and it is super cool. And so, when I think about that environment of delivering 16% core growth against, a very challenging comparison, right? I think from recollection, we had 53% organic growth last year, and I think 13% base growth, and we had bookings that were even stronger than our revenue. So it gives you a sense of how good things are and all the geographies, all of the end markets were actually quite good. Right. So, I feel good about the outlook. I feel good about the momentum we were able to de-risk the vaccines and therapies, even though, I think there are scenarios that is going to be above that sort of de-risk level. And so I think, the world is super positive and, when I think about the macro, I worry about our colleagues. Like I worry about our colleagues in China. I worry about our 300 colleagues in Ukraine. That's the kind of stuff that when I read about macro, that's really where my concern is. It's less about the business self associated with it.\nVijay Kumar : It's helpful perspective, Marc. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks Vijay.\nOperator: Thank you. And then next question comes from Rachel [indiscernible] of JPMorgan. Rachel, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. So question on China, you flag the guidance incorporates the $350 million headwind from Ukraine and China. So could you just break out how much of that is specifically in China? And then can you talk about your approach to guidance just in terms of future lockdowns and how we should think about China growth return in 2023?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, so roughly, Rachel, roughly half of that is related to China. And as Marc said it earlier on that China bounced back from the original depth of the pandemic pretty fast, and it's pretty resilient economy. So, we've learned from that to help our customers get a pack up and running where they've been out of the out of the workplace. And we're very focused on enabling that success when they're able to get back to positions of work.\nMarc Casper: Our guidance assumes it's all in Q2 in terms of construction for China.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then could you spend a minute talking about what you're seeing in the clinical environment in terms of hospital capacity constraints and how funding is trending as well? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So in terms of healthcare and diagnostics the core there was actually quite good. When I think about we had broad-based strength in terms of core growth there in the high single digits. So, I feel good about that. And there was obviously some level of COVID disruptions and things of that sort, but in aggregate, the results were strong across healthcare and diagnostics. And obviously we had less revenue in the testing, which is why the customer base is down, down roughly 15%, but underlying that the core is \u2013 was quite good and feels like that outlook will continue to be positive. Thanks for asking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink Securities. Puneet, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Marc. Thanks for taking the questions. So first one it really from your vantage point which is obviously fairly large across pharma end markets, could you provide us a view into this growing question that investors have been asking around biotech funding overall? I mean, if you look at the quarter and what you are projecting in the outlook, one would say that's not the case at all. There are no questions on biotech funding, but if you look at the early stages of pre-clinical and clinical and maybe clinical trials overall, maybe could you outline for us what you're seeing here near-to-midterm and pay down [indiscernible], PPD and other businesses across the board?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Puneet, what I would say is the end market, pharma biotech incredibly strong with the mid-teens growth organically and if you \u2013 because we do everything on an organic basis in our end market description as opposed to a core organic, as it gets too confusing to think about all the history, but if you included the PPD numbers in that end market, it would be better than the mid-teens. So very strong orders which is a good indication, now the future is really strong, right? So the activity level is very good and the outlook is very strong. And when we have our \u2013 we've completed all of our business reviews and we talk about what are they seeing within those different customer base? Actually, the outlook is good. So one way to think about is at a company level, you take a long-term perspective, right? We say our 7% to 9% core organic growth. Pharma biotech will be above that, but when you kind of work your way through the math around the assumptions, it doesn't nearly need to be the rate that is growing at to drive 7% to 9% growth, right? We had a 15% growth in pharma and biotech, and we grew 16% in the quarter, right? So when you have strong growth in that end market given that it's a little more than half our revenue, it really flows through hugely. And given the last 10-plus years, even longer than that of the growth we've been able to deliver in pharma and biotech, I'm super bullish about what our outlook is. And I can even remember I was here with the patent clips like years and years and years and years ago, and we actually grew well through those because we helped our customers navigate productivity challenges that they were facing. That was a large pharma dynamic and a long-time ago, but we're so attuned to our customer needs we helped them through it. So that's how I think about it, and I feel great about what the outlook is.\nPuneet Souda: That's super helpful, Marc. Just a clarification that Stephen on the analytical technologies, it obviously came in a strong you pointed to electron microscopy from targeted mass spec couple of those elements. And maybe could you elaborate what's driving this growth. I mean, when we looked at it even with the normal seasonality of the fourth quarter to first quarter, this was meaningfully strong. So what's driving the strength of the instruments in the first quarter when you look at the end markets and customers? Thank you.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Puneet a great question. So I think about Analytical Instruments is we've had great bookings for few quarters now for the business, and as Marc mentioned at the beginning that really strength across all three aspects of that segment. And then I highlighted the two that the most significant contributors electron microscopy is in great position in terms of serving life science customers, as well as material science applications including very strong growth in semiconductor applications for, for that customer set, and a great growth in Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry as well. So it's a really broad-based strength across there and funding environment is been good for the end market.\nRafael Tejada: Thanks for the question. Thanks, Puneet.\nPuneet Souda: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias of Stifel. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Arias: Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, on bio-production beyond COVID, are there any ships through noticeable trends that are taking place when it just comes to upstream versus downstream work in the portfolios that you have there? I mean, obviously the cell culture piece is driving a lot of what's going on, but just across the portfolio, I'm curious to whether there's any nuance to what you're seeing?\nMarc Casper: No, actually the performance was very strong. I looked at obviously the other companies that reported. I feel good about our performance in the bio-production defined that that way. And we had good strength in cell culture media, purification resins, pharma analytics and single-use technology. So actually, no, there's nothing there that sort of we gleaned in terms of that some difference. So actually its quite broad-based to strength.\nDan Arias: Yes. Okay. And then maybe just on the share that you mentioned. How does China stack up there in terms of the opportunity and what you've seen just with the thought being that sometimes these global disruptions tend to shake out some of the smaller or the less agile players? I'm wondering if regionally that's becoming more noticeable or whether it's just sort of the baseline operating scenario that you see.\nMarc Casper: Yes. We're still looking at how others performed in China in the quarter. So I feel good about our double-digit growth and team's doing a nice job and the momentum is broad base. So our customers do value the scale and the depth of capabilities that we have. Like we really create a spectacular experience for our customers in China, so it doesn't surprise me that the business is performing well and we'll help them navigate the very challenging time with the pandemic and then get back to business as usual as that wanes.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question today comes from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Matt, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks Marc and Stephen. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the industrial applied end market as it relates to instruments, yet another strong quarter. Are there some secular growth drivers that you think are being underappreciated by the market is driving this growth above and beyond maybe some of the pent-up demand we saw last year? And maybe just maybe talk about some of the secular growth drivers, if you can identify them?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Matt thanks for the \u2013 thanks for the final question. Yes. So as Stephen said the Analytical Instruments business had a really good start to the year. Good growth and revenue and really strong growth in bookings. I would say that the one end-market that's really; really humming is what I call broadly the material science applications, semiconductor advanced materials, battery technologies, really very strong growth. That's not implying that the life science is very healthy and doing well, and the businesses are doing really well. But I'd say the continued demand and outlook for the material science related business is really strong and that bodes really well for the growth of our instruments business this year and into next. So that would be the thing I'd probably highlight.\nMarc Casper: Thanks for the question today. And let me do a quick wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining the call. We're very pleased with the strong start and we're in a very good position to achieve another excellent year. And I look forward to updating you at our upcoming Investor Day on May 18th, and as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call thank call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with an excellent Q1. In the quarter, we delivered 16% core organic growth, $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue, $7.25 for adjusted earnings per share, and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q1 was just over $1 billion higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $700 million driven by a very strong start of the year for the core business and just under $400 million from testing. The strength of the core was brought-based across businesses and markets and geographies. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull through on this revenue and adjusted EPS for Q1 was $0.84 higher than included in our previous guidance. So broad-based beat to start the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $7.25 of adjusted EPS in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.61 down 5% versus the prior year. On the top line, a Q1 reported revenue grew 19% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 16% and as I mentioned, we delivered $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America grew in the low-single digits. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-teens, with China growing in the low-double digits. And rest of the world declined in low-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, 620 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Adjusted operating margins came in slightly higher than we'd have anticipated in our prior guidance for Q1 reflecting how well our growth strategy and PPI business system enables us to manage dynamic times. We executed strong pricing realization, productivity and volume leveraging the core business enabling us to appropriately address higher inflation, and this was more than offset by the expected impacts of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and the impact of strategic investments including continued investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 47.5%, 660 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.2% of revenue, a decrease of 20 basis points versus Q1 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q1 representing growth of 14% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the lines of the quarter, our net interest expense was $118 million, $5 million higher than Q1 last year largely due to acquisition financing activities. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.1%. This was a 190 basis points lower than Q1 last year, driven by a tax planning initiative. Average diluted shares with $395 million in Q1, approximately $3 million lower year-over-year driven by share purchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system enables to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong top line performance. Cash flow from operating activities in Q1 was $2.2 billion, and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are progressing well and this quarter's net capital expenditures with $640 million. In January we returned $2 billion of the capital to shareholders through buybacks. Also during the quarter we increased our dividend by 15%. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.8 billion in cash and $33.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and 2.4 times on net debt basis. And concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC with 18% reflecting the strong returns on investments that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance about four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as previously mentioned we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving onto the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment increased 1% and organic revenue was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1 we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was upset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income and Life Science Solutions decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 51.4% down to 280 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity that was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments Segment reported revenue increased 9% in Q1 and organic growth was 12%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in a segment increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 19.8% up 20 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity, that was offset by strategic investments we're making across this segment. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1 reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue declined 7%. In the quarter, we saw a strong underlying growth in our healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 17% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9% down 260 basis points from the prior year. In Q1, we drove strong productivity. This was more than offset by business mix and the strategic investments in the segment. And finally in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, in Q1 reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic growth was 6%. During Q1, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and the laboratory products, businesses. PPD, our clinical research business is performing very well. And during the quarter, it grew a few points above the company average core organic growth rate. It contributed $1.66 billion of revenue to the segment in the quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 17% and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, which is 340 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments and business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance, as Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. And on the bottom line, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 for the year. So very strong outlook, particularly as it also factors in the notable macro developments that occurred following our last earnings call in February. Our team continues to do an excellent job navigating through a fluid macroeconomic environment to help us deliver outstanding results, reflecting the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of the PPI Business System to operate with speed at scale. So, let me get into the details of the guidance raise, in terms of revenue there are three elements driving the raising guidance, $350 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue for the year, a $200 million decrease due to the change in FX rates and a $300 million increase in the outlook for the core business. The core revenue raise incorporates a $350 million headwinds from the conflict in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China. And we chose to de-risk $600 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in the outlook, offsetting it with other core revenue. Our guidance now assumes $1.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue in total for 2022. Incorporating both of these and still being able to raise the full year outlook for the core shows that the business is performing very well. And as I mentioned previously, we're increasing the core organic growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. In terms of like COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, continuing the same de-risk approach to guidance as there a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $2.1 billion of testing revenue in 2022, which represents the $1.68 billion delivered in Q1, $225 million in Q2. And then an assumed endemic run rate level of a $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case? We're well positioned to support customer needs as we did in Q1 and we'll flow these benefits through our P&L, but for now we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risk approach to the outlook. In terms of profitability, we expected to deliver $90 million more adjusted operating income up to $450 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull through on the additional revenue, partially offset by a $150 million of additional compensation to our colleagues to help them with the temporary impacts of insulation. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 from $22.43 to $22.65 further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. PPD our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.7 billion in 2022 in revenue, which represents 11% core organic growth on a full year basis for this business, up three percentage points from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to deliver just over a $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022 and contribute a $1.98 to adjusted EPS in the year up $0.08 from our prior guidance. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $700 million on revenue, or 1.8% and $0.54 on adjusted EPS. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $490 million for the year. We now expect an adjusted income tax rate of 13.1% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guide driven by the improved earnings outlook. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. A guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital to return to shareholders through dividends. And we now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling, revenue dollars for the remainder of the year they're expected to be fairly linear with Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. Core organic growth for Q2 is expected to be lower than Q3 and Q4 due to an estimated 200 basis point impact of lockdowns in China. And in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we expect Q2 as a percentage of the full year to be just slightly lower than the comparable periods last year. To conclude we'd live an excellent start to the year, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes, so Derik so let's think about the gross margins this quarter kind of another 47.5% level be slightly lower for the remainder of the year and still in the year in that kind of mid-40s. And I think what people are not fully baking in is the impact of PPD. That has sizeable change to the overall company's gross margin when you factor that in. And then FX is a little bit of negative in terms of the margin profile. But it's really the impact of testing coming down and then the benefit of having PPD in the business. I think that's probably the thing that's missing the most. Yes. So, Vijay, so outline in the prepared remarks, the strength of the PPD business is going up to 11% for the year. So that would be a strong contribution and can you characterize the vaccines and therapies, and then we're offsetting that all of that from vaccines therapy and it increasing our guidance. So the core business is increasing $350 million in the raise. So going up to 8% to 9% strong performance. And that's obviously taking into an account and that switching back in the therapies to core, and offsetting the impact of the macroeconomic implications in China and situation in Ukraine. Yes, so roughly, Rachel, roughly half of that is related to China. And as Marc said it earlier on that China bounced back from the original depth of the pandemic pretty fast, and it's pretty resilient economy. So, we've learned from that to help our customers get a pack up and running where they've been out of the out of the workplace. And we're very focused on enabling that success when they're able to get back to positions of work. Yes. So Puneet a great question. So I think about Analytical Instruments is we've had great bookings for few quarters now for the business, and as Marc mentioned at the beginning that really strength across all three aspects of that segment. And then I highlighted the two that the most significant contributors electron microscopy is in great position in terms of serving life science customers, as well as material science applications including very strong growth in semiconductor applications for, for that customer set, and a great growth in Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry as well. So it's a really broad-based strength across there and funding environment is been good for the end market."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call.  As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. That strength is broad based, including PPD, our clinical research business, where the integration is going smoothly and we're even more excited about the opportunities we have to further enable the success of our pharma and biotech customers. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our business. Our continued success as the result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system, which continues to be a differentiator for us. It enables our team to further strengthen our company by finding a better way every day. When I think about the macro events much has changed since the start of the year. The war Ukraine, rising inflation, COVID lockdowns in China. What hasn't changed is our ability to navigate a dynamic landscape and deliver exceptional performance. You'll see that in our first quarter results and outlook for the year. So let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 19% year-over-year $11.82 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $3.45 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 29.2%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $7.25 per share. Let me now give you to color on the performance by our end markets. Building on the momentum from 2021 we delivered excellent performance to start the year. Our outstanding results this quarter were due to our team's strong execution, good market conditions, and share gain. We also had meaningful contribution from COVID-19 testing as we continue to support our customers' needs. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had another outstanding quarter of performance delivering growth in the mid-teens. We broad base strength in this end market, as our customers value our trusted partner status. In the academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digit during the quarter, with good growth in biosciences, electron microscopy, and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens during the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses. Electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry and chemical analysis, as well as in the research and safety market channel.  And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, Q1 revenue declined in the mid-teens. In the core business we saw strong growth in clinical diagnostics, transplant diagnostics, and the healthcare market channel. During the quarter the team executed really well to support COVID-19 testing needs. Let me now provide an update in the progress we made in Q1, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, a commitment to high impact innovation, scale in the high growth and emerging markets and a unique value proposition to our customers. We made great progress in the first quarter, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter for high-impact innovation, as we launched a number of new products that will help our customers break new ground in our important work. A few of the highlights. In our genetic sciences business, we launched our Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Flex Series genetic analyzer to improve clinical research and advanced scientific discovery. In Analytical Instruments, we launched four new Gas Chromatography and GCMS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. This includes the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph, which incorporates enhanced automation for instrument health monitoring, and offers flexibility for customers to optimize their workflow. In bioproduction, we launched the Gibco CTS Xenon Electroporation system for the efficient delivery of genetic material into cells, as part of cell therapy manufacturing. In addition, we signed an agreement with precision diagnostic company Oncocyte, to develop two new assays for our Ion Torrent Genexus System to improve cancer tumor profiling, and advanced precision medicine. This is just a small sampling of the outstanding innovation going on across our company, enabling our customer success and strengthening our position as the world leader in serving science. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We had strong performance in these markets, including China, which grew double-digits in the quarter. Our Analytical Instruments business are being used around the world to advance scientific research, including the high growth and emerging markets. For example, in Beijing, the National Institute of Biological Sciences is using our mass spectrometers to accelerate their research in structural biology. And in Korea, our electron microscopes are enabling researchers at Pusan National University to establish a bio imaging center to accelerate virus research. Now turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our unique customer value proposition. We continue to enhance our capabilities, so we can be an even stronger partner and industry leader. To help our customers advance cell and gene therapies we opened a new bio repository in Vacaville, California. This facility will provide specialized biological sample storage and cell therapy logistics. In bioproduction our network expansion is going well. During the quarter, we brought on additional capacity online for single use bio process containers and cell culture media. Reflecting our trusted partner status with pharma and biotech customers, we entered a 15-year strategic collaboration agreement with Moderna to establish large scale U.S. manufacturing of mRNA-based vaccine and therapies. Under this agreement, we'll provide dedicated capacity for a range of aseptic fill-finish services, along with inspection labeling and final packaging. During the quarter, I had the chance to visit our Greenville, North Carolina campus, where we've invested significantly over the past couple of years to expand our capacity and capabilities. And the new building that will support Moderna's pipeline, it's truly impressive. Now, turning to capital deployment. I'd like to share some of the other steps we've taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our discipline capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Given this was the first a full quarter of contribution from PPD, our new clinical research business, I'd like to update you on our progress. The business is performing very well and running ahead of the deal model, the strong start and outlook for the year is allowing us to increase our expectations for the business. Stephen will cover these details in his remarks. In terms of the integration, it's going very smoothly. Our customers are seeing the value of the combination, and we have realized our first commercial synergies securing new authorizations from pharma and biotech customers who value the combination of our capabilities, this bodes well for our long-term revenue synergies. To further fuel growth and support increasing demand from our biopharma customers, we've also invested to expand our clinical research operations in Richmond, Virginia. Finally, I've been super impressed with the team, as I've visited different sites. And together we're taking the business to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher to become an even stronger partner for our customers. As I mentioned on our last call, we closed on PeproTech, a leading provider of bioscience reagents late last year. I'm pleased to note that that business is also a great start and the integration is going incredibly well. During Q1, we completed a small bolt-on deal in analytical instruments to enhance our materials and structural analysis offering for our customers. And during the quarter, we also returned significant capitals for our shareholders. We purchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 15%. Turning now to a brief update on our ESG initiatives. We marked a significant milestone during the first quarter, exceeding one million readily recyclable paper coolers ship to transport coal chain products without the use of traditional polystyrene foam coolers. This builds on our commitment to environmental stewardship and enabling broad adoption of sustainable solutions. In addition, we recently announced our partnership with the University of California in San Diego to advance an innovation, sustainability and talent development. This 10-year partnership will establish a network tech of technology centers focused on accelerating collaborative research and advancing innovations in a range of scientific fields. It will also accelerate educational opportunities, especially for under resource students, by engaging in joint stem and community outreach programs and supporting curriculum development, scholarships, fellowships, career mentoring, and recruitment Before covering guidance. I'd like to end my comments with a reflection on the events that are impacting our colleagues and the world at large. As always our top priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're supporting our colleagues, displaced from Ukraine with a variety of needs and together with our colleagues globally, we've made substantial donations to relief organizations, responding in Ukraine and enabling safe-haven countries. In China, where many of our colleagues are facing lengthy lockdowns and disruption in daily life due to the pandemic. We're providing care packages to residents in Shanghai who have faced limited food supplies. We're also recognize that inflation is challenging for our team, and we're going to provide a special payment this summer to our colleagues. Now, I'd like to review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion, which would result in 8% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 per share. This guidance factors in are excellent Q1, includes a very strong core business outlook for the remainder of the year. And it incorporates the expected impact of the recent macroeconomic dynamics. Our Q1 results and our increased guide for the year reflects, how well the team is navigating these dynamic times. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our outstanding results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. Our business is performing very well and we're gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns, and we're really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. So our clinical research business, formally PPD off to a great start. As a reminder, the business had tremendous success in 2021 delivering great performance, great authorizations, even from especially after the announcement, just incredibly focused on great execution. Customers are excited about the potential and that momentum continued into Q1. Very strong performance on revenue and really good growth and authorizations. As I look at what's going on in the industry and look at some of the other companies that have reported, our results look favorable to the results that we saw. So we feel good about that, as an external reference point. And the switch strength within PPD was broad based across the different customer types, the funding environment, it was actually a great start to the year. Integration's gone really well. We feel good about that, and I'm really excited that commercial team has secured our first wins that are what I would call synergy related in the form of new authorization. So really a very cool start to the year, and we're excited about what the potential holds for our clinical research business. Yes, so Jack thanks. It's a great question. We made a decision on the guidance on vaccines and therapies, actually just because the number of questions we were getting from investors relative to our enterprise value and the sort of net present value of the company was disproportionate, right? So, we just basically said, we had a really good start on vaccines and therapies for the year. We did just under $500 million of revenue, which was what we expected to do. The $2.1 billion that we put in the original guidance of vaccine therapy related revenue is actually still a number that can be achieved. I call it at the high end of the range. And as you know, we're involved in so many of the programs, we're involved in the vaccine programs and the therapy programs we're involved in the drug substance and the drug product. We're involved in the enabling technology. So it's across many of our different capabilities and we feel good about it. We chose to effectively reduce the number in the, sort of in the target because the core business is performing so well that we just wanted to take the dialogue really off the table, as you know the capacity that makes these products and provides the enabling technologies is truly repurposable to other customers and to other products within the biologic field. So, we're very encouraged by that. And then to your question, we are expecting very strong growth for our pharma services and our bioproduction business in 2022 and beyond. So Jack thanks for the questions. Patrick, thanks for the question. So, the team really did an excellent job in Q1 navigating the lockdowns as started towards the end of the quarter to deliver double-digit growth and to really work with the government to be able to supply the critical products that we provide to the customer base there, even in difficult circumstances. Very impressive. What our assumption is actually fairly straightforward. We're looking at the back half of the year that Q3 and Q4 are normal in China, back to strong growth. And as you know, the business there rebounded super quickly after the Q1 of 2020 disruption. So the economy is there is quite resilient. Our assumption is in this quarter, there's a couple points of headwind. We're baking into the numbers because the number of the customers are closed. Academic institutions in Shanghai would be closed so that, it'll take, a period of time for that to rebound and as activity ramps back up. So that's how we're thinking about it in terms of the quarter. And we were able to fully bake that into our guidance and Stephen in the revenue phasing, views, try to make it clearer that what our outlook is for Q2, which is still quite good, but feels a little bit of that pressure and then Q3, Q4 picks up from there. Yes. So, Patrick, thanks for the follow-up on that. So, I would think about it, the following, the timing of the transition and what the long-term demand for COVID there are so many scenarios, it's very hard to say which quarter, which year exactly how things play out, right? Because the capacity is re-purposable we will move that over time. And in our long-term model that Stephen presented last September, it effectively reflects that that's all transitioned by the end of the model period. So that it was part of core. It doesn't affect the 7% to 9% long-term outlook. As I looked to 2023, I mean, as a reminder, we play a role in both therapies and vaccines. So, they are on different cycles and different scenarios, which is, I think, most scenarios have the pandemic existing in some endemic form next year. And therefore, therapy demand should exist with some level of consistency and vaccines is a wide range of out outcomes. Obviously the smaller, vial, the single use actually drives more revenue per thing. So, you have a lot of moving pieces. And our job is to manage all of that, manage the transition at the right timeframe and we will. I think the one piece of new information that, I think, is interesting is one of our customers, not in the top tier of the activity level within COVID, actually just repurposed its own commitments to other therapies and activities. So that was actually made that transition even smoother for a portion of it. And basically, in the future basically is taking the commitments and say, when they don't need COVID capacity, they're going to basically use it for other thing. So, hopefully all that color gives you a sense that we'll manage that over time and will continue to deliver strong growth as a company. Thanks. Good morning. Yes, so, Derik, thanks for the question. So, as you know, we never really talk about specific customers unless a customer is announcing this on their own behalf, and then we're more than happy to make some high-level comments, right, because it's really, our job is to support our customers' activity. I think that our take is that we did a really good job of supporting our clients during the course of the pandemic across all of the different activities. And that enhanced our reputation, our trusted partner status with our customers. And as in the case of Moderna they had the opportunity to work with us and decided to leverage our capabilities in Greenville, North Carolina, and our expertise to support their future pipeline from a sterile fill finish perspective. And it's super exciting in terms of the capabilities of the things that we will support longer term from them there. We have many different models of how we work with our clients in our pharma services business. And it's our job to support them in the best way that they want. We do have what we call condo models, where customers have some dedicated capacity. We have the traditional fee-for-service models. And then we have some other innovative ones. The other public one obviously was announced a couple years ago, which was CSL, right, which is, we took over one of their facilities, we're going to be manufacturing one of their new therapies and they are expanding the collaboration with us. So, it's a long menu of options and our job is to help our customers navigate their future and be really valuable to them. Yes, it's a great question, right. So, when we think about living and navigating through an inflationary environment, our team is doing a good job of managing productivity and managing cost and mitigating what can be mitigated. So, I'm very pleased with that. Our expectation for pricing is \u2013 and in normally as you know, it's a half point to a point of price that we get within our business. And this year we would expect that price would be about double the high end of that range or about two points of price within our outlook for the year. So, it's our job to support our customers, to explain the inflations and where we can offset it and where we need customers to support us. And those dialogues have been constructive and positive. Yes. So, when I look at the performance, I look at the pipeline, I look at the authorizations, which is the new wins. When I look at the revenue, when I cut it by the different types of customers, we had a really strong start to the year. When I look at, I read not all, but some of the different commentary, and the differing views out there my take is, is that there was nothing abnormal in cancellations in the quarter, there was no trend to any of that. And actually we are on track to deliver very strong results, but the 11% growth that we're looking at for this year is really impressive because last year we're spectacular, right? In terms of the growth that the business delivered. So against a challenging comp that's really, really encouraging, and authorization support that for this year, but also support the long-term expectations that this is a high single digit growth business. And when we drive, synergies, it can be better than that. So, super cool times, but obviously early. You're welcome. Yes. I mean, I can't wait until May 18. It'll be super cool. We're going to have it back in person. It'll be a great way to showcase our team and showcase the great things going on at the company. And we'll explain some of the stuff today in some more detail. And so it'll be very positive from that perspective. When I think about the business, right, we highlighted some of the macroeconomic dynamics, right? Because if you watch TV, you read the papers, you're on the internet, whatever it is that you get the external world, it's a bumpy time in the world, but when you get within our four walls right now, it is awesome. I mean, it is an amazing time of the company the momentum is huge. The customers are doing well, we are gaining markets share, and it is super cool. And so, when I think about that environment of delivering 16% core growth against, a very challenging comparison, right? I think from recollection, we had 53% organic growth last year, and I think 13% base growth, and we had bookings that were even stronger than our revenue. So it gives you a sense of how good things are and all the geographies, all of the end markets were actually quite good. Right. So, I feel good about the outlook. I feel good about the momentum we were able to de-risk the vaccines and therapies, even though, I think there are scenarios that is going to be above that sort of de-risk level. And so I think, the world is super positive and, when I think about the macro, I worry about our colleagues. Like I worry about our colleagues in China. I worry about our 300 colleagues in Ukraine. That's the kind of stuff that when I read about macro, that's really where my concern is. It's less about the business self associated with it. Thanks Vijay. Our guidance assumes it's all in Q2 in terms of construction for China. Yes. So in terms of healthcare and diagnostics the core there was actually quite good. When I think about we had broad-based strength in terms of core growth there in the high single digits. So, I feel good about that. And there was obviously some level of COVID disruptions and things of that sort, but in aggregate, the results were strong across healthcare and diagnostics. And obviously we had less revenue in the testing, which is why the customer base is down, down roughly 15%, but underlying that the core is \u2013 was quite good and feels like that outlook will continue to be positive. Thanks for asking the questions. Yes. So Puneet, what I would say is the end market, pharma biotech incredibly strong with the mid-teens growth organically and if you \u2013 because we do everything on an organic basis in our end market description as opposed to a core organic, as it gets too confusing to think about all the history, but if you included the PPD numbers in that end market, it would be better than the mid-teens. So very strong orders which is a good indication, now the future is really strong, right? So the activity level is very good and the outlook is very strong. And when we have our \u2013 we've completed all of our business reviews and we talk about what are they seeing within those different customer base? Actually, the outlook is good. So one way to think about is at a company level, you take a long-term perspective, right? We say our 7% to 9% core organic growth. Pharma biotech will be above that, but when you kind of work your way through the math around the assumptions, it doesn't nearly need to be the rate that is growing at to drive 7% to 9% growth, right? We had a 15% growth in pharma and biotech, and we grew 16% in the quarter, right? So when you have strong growth in that end market given that it's a little more than half our revenue, it really flows through hugely. And given the last 10-plus years, even longer than that of the growth we've been able to deliver in pharma and biotech, I'm super bullish about what our outlook is. And I can even remember I was here with the patent clips like years and years and years and years ago, and we actually grew well through those because we helped our customers navigate productivity challenges that they were facing. That was a large pharma dynamic and a long-time ago, but we're so attuned to our customer needs we helped them through it. So that's how I think about it, and I feel great about what the outlook is. No, actually the performance was very strong. I looked at obviously the other companies that reported. I feel good about our performance in the bio-production defined that that way. And we had good strength in cell culture media, purification resins, pharma analytics and single-use technology. So actually, no, there's nothing there that sort of we gleaned in terms of that some difference. So actually its quite broad-based to strength. Yes. We're still looking at how others performed in China in the quarter. So I feel good about our double-digit growth and team's doing a nice job and the momentum is broad base. So our customers do value the scale and the depth of capabilities that we have. Like we really create a spectacular experience for our customers in China, so it doesn't surprise me that the business is performing well and we'll help them navigate the very challenging time with the pandemic and then get back to business as usual as that wanes. Yes. So Matt thanks for the \u2013 thanks for the final question. Yes. So as Stephen said the Analytical Instruments business had a really good start to the year. Good growth and revenue and really strong growth in bookings. I would say that the one end-market that's really; really humming is what I call broadly the material science applications, semiconductor advanced materials, battery technologies, really very strong growth. That's not implying that the life science is very healthy and doing well, and the businesses are doing really well. But I'd say the continued demand and outlook for the material science related business is really strong and that bodes really well for the growth of our instruments business this year and into next. So that would be the thing I'd probably highlight. Thanks for the question today. And let me do a quick wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining the call. We're very pleased with the strong start and we're in a very good position to achieve another excellent year. And I look forward to updating you at our upcoming Investor Day on May 18th, and as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone."

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc N. Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrates strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong operational disciplines and commercial execution. In 2023, we delivered differentiated short-term performance while at the same time strengthening our long-term competitive position.  I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.89 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI business system to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers.  Turning to our performance by end market, in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, as expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a seven-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status. We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future.  In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high-single digits for the full year. In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year. In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses.  I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthened our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024.  In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 S/TEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition.  In Life Sciences Solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in low laboratory products we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future.  In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. Building on our longstanding relationship with Borenger Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.  Now let me turn to our PPI business system and our mission driven culture, which continued to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI business system toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience.  A quick recap on capital deployment last year. We continued to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of the binding site, our protein diagnostics business which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model.  As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods. This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and there's strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefits of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well.  During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink Technology compliments our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.  Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. And I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world. This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030.  To advance Global Health Equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies, as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies, Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women, and named us as one of the best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continued to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond.  So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers.  I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our longstanding relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They're enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well-positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this in combination with the power of our PPI business system delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. We're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen. \nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we had expected in the quarter, and through the great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind, so really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all the while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science.  Let me now provide you some additional details in our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, we delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tail end of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5% and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic related revenue, $330 million of testing and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue.  Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year. In Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits.  With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization, this is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI business system. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%.  Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023.  Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year-over-year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in this segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39% and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segments, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our Pharma Services business within 2023 as had been expected. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022. Let me now turn to guidance, and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year, our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year. Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year-over-year, the combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to zero. We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024 and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we closed the acquisition of Olink by midyear. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 2023. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Marc, if you look at the business -- so if you look at the business, I think the question is that you start to see some recovery. Could you talk about what parts you think could grow more or less above market and just what that can mean in terms of revenue and earnings?\nMarc N. Casper: Yes. So Jack, when I think about last year and you've heard us say delivering differentiated short-term performance, strengthen the company for the long term kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first nine months of how others have done, and we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far. And we had a really strong year in terms of delivering above-market growth, which means share gain, right. And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance. You look at things like Analytical Instruments, very strong; clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm not implying anything in the others. This is a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions. As I think to the future, we're well positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year, it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps as the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance. And we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And are there specific businesses you can talk about, so as an example in the script, I think you talked about transitioning capacity, new therapies. So like in a potential recovery, like what -- can you talk about how you expect phasing for Patheon and some of -- and the bioprocessing business?\nMarc N. Casper: Yes. So when I think about the year, we basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year based on lapping the comps as well as we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds. And that helps with demand for the industry and for us is how I would think about the business in aggregate is the way that we manage the company. So thank you, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nDaniel Arias: Good morning guys, thanks for the questions. Marc, obviously, a lot of discussion on destocking across the industry. Can you just maybe add some color to where you think you are with that process and maybe draw a distinction for us between the inventory work-down that's taking place on the bioprocess side specifically versus more routine consumables, if you split it that way, are the drawdowns kind of happening at a similar pace and ending in a similar time or do you think we should sort of keep those two buckets separately or think of them differently?\nMarc N. Casper: Yes. So Dan, I guess, let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question, and then maybe I'll step one level above that. In terms of bioproduction, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically, it's been an incredibly good market. Sort of a taboo name these days, right, in terms of bioproduction, caused a lot of volatility during certainly 2023 in the industry. For us, a couple of facts, it's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there. When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3. But the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection. We weren't expecting one and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds and as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one is going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens. So it will play out during the course of the year, and the long-term fundamentals here are very strong. When I think about our businesses in general coming into the year, I think the things that are very exciting is the trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. We're in the room with the decision-makers. We understand what's on their mind. We're incredibly well positioned. And if I think about the midterm outlook for clinical research, for Pharma Services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well positioned, right, in terms of we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs to their pipeline, we're part of helping them navigate whatever the environment is. So hopefully, that's helpful. And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech, as I'll call it, the smaller companies, the capital market-dependent companies in the pharmaceutical segment, they were much more positive, right. They're seeing green shoots. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last five quarters in terms of what the tone was on their view. And I think that bodes very well for the coming few years. Thank you.\nDaniel Arias: Okay. That's encouraging. Maybe just a follow-up on the AI piece, consistently solid growth there. I'm curious if you're just still carrying a backlog in microscopy. And can you maybe just talk a little bit about lead times and order conversion this year, is the assumption that those might get extended as we move through the year or do you think maybe you can be stable relative to where we are today? Thanks. \nMarc N. Casper: Yes. So when I think about the performance of our Analytical Instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, it's awesome. Really a tremendous year. It was across all three businesses. The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023, those things largely cleared in the first half of 2023. So we're at -- we've been normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about six months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And yeah, there won't be the repeat of the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain. The business is positioned for a good year and there's a high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy, or semiconductor, material science, life sciences or the Astral, right, [indiscernible] just incredible demand for those technologies. So we're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning everyone. \nMarc N. Casper: Good morning Derik. \nDerik De Bruin: So Marc, I'm just sort of curious, last quarter you were talking about 1% core growth when you were sort of looking at your initial framework for 2024. If I heard you correctly, now it's plus or minus 1%. It didn't seem like Q4 got a lot worse in anything. So what -- sort of what's changed, are you more conservative on the PPD in these businesses, are you more conservative on just tough comps, I'm just sort of curious, what's embedded now in this like more conservative outlook?\nMarc N. Casper: Stephen, why don't you...\nStephen Williamson: Yes. Let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of step back on that and then -- and hopefully help frame your question. So we provided an early framing for 2024 on our last call, and we had the insight on how Q4 played out and have completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significant. The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. It includes the latest view on FX, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing. And then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past three months is a discrete item in our Pharma Services business. We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. Would have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 2024. Now the accounting is finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in 2025. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 2024, and that's had some impact on -- in terms of the reported core growth. And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So things are more helpful for our investors and the range of outcomes for the year. Now the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out as we see it today. And the range is about $1 billion to a revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company. But hopefully, it kind of tees up kind of the framing for the guide.\nDerik De Bruin: Okay. And a little bit more, how should we sort of think about the segment margins as we go through, I mean, I'm just sort of looking -- I mean you've seen really good progress in LSS, and it may seem a good progress in your margins, expansion of margins across all of them. But I'm just sort of thinking about how should we think about LPS and given where you were in the -- is that 14% margin range that we're seeing for the full year, is that sort of sustainable, does that fall back next year, I'm just trying to figure out where the margin hit is on given relative to what our expectations were?\nStephen Williamson: In terms of the margin profile for the -- we finished the year at exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. So when I see some of the pre-call notes, this is, I think, a little bit different in terms of what some expectations. But from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected. And then from margins going forward, I think the margin profile that we have today, I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are on landing point on margins for the segments is probably a good starting point for the -- to think about for the year ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nDouglas Schenkel: Alright, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. \nMarc N. Casper: Good morning Doug, welcome back. \nDouglas Schenkel: Thanks, great to be back. And working with great focus like you and the team. So I want to start just with a high-level LRP question, and then my follow-up is really just a clarification on LPS. So on the LRP, Marc, you've been consistent in saying that Thermo is built to grow two to three points better than the peer group over the long term. That said, you did talk about 7% to 9% growth as recently as last year's Analyst Day. I'm sure the two to three points hasn't changed. But as we flip the calendar, is it fair to say that the 7% to 9% growth rate maybe is a little bit high, even in a more normalized environment, I just want to give you an opportunity to maybe just adjust that as we kind of flip the calendar and look ahead? And below the top line, you've done a fantastic job, as always, leaning operations in a more challenging period. Never let a good crisis go to waste. Your guidance suggests to me, at least on the surface, that you may be investing more in the near term. But as we think about a return to normal, I'm just wondering if you think we could get some outsized incremental margin flow-through for the business as the business normalizes? So let me leave it there, and then I'll ask a quick follow-up on LPS in a second.\nMarc N. Casper: Sure. So Doug, thanks for the question. In terms of the long-range outlook, right, we raised our outlook in late in 2021. And what that -- at that moment, we can't remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%, right. We were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market, right. And in terms of our ability to gain share, three points, I think -- two, three, I use three for simplicity. Three points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to. And we've been delivering that for a while, and we've been growing share for a really long while for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there. In terms of the market growth, where the market was extraordinary when we set it, we said 4% to 6% was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3% to 5%. And the change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there. When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well positioned to grow, for simplicity, three points faster than that, so 7% to 9%. So while I get the question a lot and obviously, in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long-term health of the industry. I've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying, if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, you're probably at 6% long-term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth. But you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment because this -- we really are a GDP-plus-type business in terms of the markets that we serve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it and while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position. In terms of the below the line, the very high-level concept, I do believe that as you see volumes grow at more normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow-through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math as you have some level of headwind embedded in the easier numbers, nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step-up that one would expect to have.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. I'm going to -- I'll leave the LPS question for another day. But I guess, the other part of my question on the margins, Marc was obviously, you got to pay people, you got to reset things. In a period where you're not growing as much, this is where Thermo has historically played offense while others have played defense to a certain extent. So I'm just wondering if you're actually pulling forward some investment early in the year and that could over the next several quarters lead to even better-than-expected margin flow-through as the company returns to a more normalized period.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP-1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial costs in the interim in 2024, which will create good accretive growth going forward. That's one good example. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company. And we're not lessening our drive here to really drive great long-term growth. So we're appropriately managing our cost, top line environment, but we're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place and to make sure that, that top line environment stays and the outlook stays as good as we -- as much as articulated.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks so much. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nVijay Kumar: Hi Marc, good morning and thanks for taking my question. My first one Marc, when I look at the annual guidance here, the core is flattish at the midpoint. But excluding the vaccine headwinds, it's about three points. That's a pretty solid guide. The three things that have come up is China, the CRO business, and analytical tech. Can you just remind us what China and what PPD did in fiscal 2023 and is the guide assuming those three pieces, China, CRO and analytical tech, is that at 3%, about 3%, below 3%? Thank you. \nMarc N. Casper: So Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about the performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future, last year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business. Really, the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results. I think that in a way, we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as what actually was going on because there's so many different things we were communicating. But if I think about clinical research, it's a little over two years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition. Customers love the business performing well, colleagues doing a great job. And it's been a big success. The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines, and at the same time, delivered by far the fastest, I'll call it, underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it. And that means for this year, we have both a roll-off, which we've given transparency to on a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison, which is cool. Like we -- that's a good challenge to have in terms of the great performance. So we would expect that the business' growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons. But the future, meaning looking out into 2025 and beyond, this is a really strong business, long-term, high single-digit growth business plus the synergies it's driving. So I feel really great about that. And then a quick comment just on China and which is unrelated to clinical research but sort of the other element of your question. China, market conditions were challenged in 2023. First quarter was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then -- so that was China effectively. We're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year. Rather, we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds. So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point, the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus. Whether that's direct or confidence or whatever it does, we don't know when that will happen. But at some point, it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high. So I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it will take some time to get there. Thanks, Vijay. Go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Stephen, just one quick one for you. On Q1, I think operating margin, slightly under 21%. I think the EPS is around $4.70-ish. Is that just the outsized impact from incentive comp reset, just want to understand the Q1 margin cadence?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year-over-year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year-over-year -- so there's -- obviously, we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp. That's just under 200 basis points in total and then about 100 basis points contribution from the core business despite the lower dollars of revenue. And the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So to give you a way to frame the margin in Q1. And then yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as the revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead. Thanks Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: It\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. \nRafael Tejada: Operator we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nTejas Savant: Hey guys, good morning. And thanks for the time here. Marc, just a follow-up on your China commentary there, more in terms of the long-term opportunity. You've talked in the past about that being an important market for you growing at the higher end of your outlook for the company. Recently, there's been a thawing in relations over the last month or so. I think you've kind of alluded to that as well and some high-level government engagement. But then a little while ago, we got word of this Biosecure Act legislation. Can you just help us think through sort of what that entails for you, perhaps an opportunity to be more front footed and gain share in the near-term on the services side versus kind of the long-term risk of a potential blowback from the Chinese side in terms of U.S. MNCs operating in that market? That would be super helpful. Thank you. \nMarc N. Casper: Sure. So thanks for the question. In terms of China, a market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society, right, and created American jobs as part of it. Better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population, we have a great reputation. I've had the honor of being the Chair of the U.S.-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the U.S. administration and the Chinese government. And while it's clear to me that the short-term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good. It will be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster-growing geographies in the long-term. In terms of the relations between the countries, yes, I agree with your sentiment, there is a thawing. And in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications. And my quick read of what they're working on in this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving Federal Government-related entities. So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously, as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well positioned to support the U.S. government. So thank you for the question. Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks everyone for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum. We're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marc N. Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrates strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong operational disciplines and commercial execution. In 2023, we delivered differentiated short-term performance while at the same time strengthening our long-term competitive position.  I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.89 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI business system to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers.  Turning to our performance by end market, in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, as expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a seven-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status. We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future.  In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high-single digits for the full year. In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year. In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses.  I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthened our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024.  In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 S/TEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition.  In Life Sciences Solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in low laboratory products we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future.  In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. Building on our longstanding relationship with Borenger Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.  Now let me turn to our PPI business system and our mission driven culture, which continued to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI business system toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience.  A quick recap on capital deployment last year. We continued to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of the binding site, our protein diagnostics business which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model.  As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods. This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and there's strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefits of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well.  During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink Technology compliments our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.  Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. And I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world. This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030.  To advance Global Health Equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies, as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies, Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women, and named us as one of the best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continued to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond.  So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers.  I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our longstanding relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They're enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well-positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this in combination with the power of our PPI business system delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. We're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen. Yes. So Jack, when I think about last year and you've heard us say delivering differentiated short-term performance, strengthen the company for the long term kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first nine months of how others have done, and we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far. And we had a really strong year in terms of delivering above-market growth, which means share gain, right. And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance. You look at things like Analytical Instruments, very strong; clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm not implying anything in the others. This is a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions. As I think to the future, we're well positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year, it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps as the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance. And we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like. Yes. So when I think about the year, we basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year based on lapping the comps as well as we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds. And that helps with demand for the industry and for us is how I would think about the business in aggregate is the way that we manage the company. So thank you, Jack. Yes. So Dan, I guess, let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question, and then maybe I'll step one level above that. In terms of bioproduction, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically, it's been an incredibly good market. Sort of a taboo name these days, right, in terms of bioproduction, caused a lot of volatility during certainly 2023 in the industry. For us, a couple of facts, it's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there. When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3. But the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection. We weren't expecting one and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds and as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one is going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens. So it will play out during the course of the year, and the long-term fundamentals here are very strong. When I think about our businesses in general coming into the year, I think the things that are very exciting is the trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. We're in the room with the decision-makers. We understand what's on their mind. We're incredibly well positioned. And if I think about the midterm outlook for clinical research, for Pharma Services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well positioned, right, in terms of we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs to their pipeline, we're part of helping them navigate whatever the environment is. So hopefully, that's helpful. And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech, as I'll call it, the smaller companies, the capital market-dependent companies in the pharmaceutical segment, they were much more positive, right. They're seeing green shoots. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last five quarters in terms of what the tone was on their view. And I think that bodes very well for the coming few years. Thank you. Yes. So when I think about the performance of our Analytical Instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, it's awesome. Really a tremendous year. It was across all three businesses. The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023, those things largely cleared in the first half of 2023. So we're at -- we've been normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about six months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And yeah, there won't be the repeat of the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain. The business is positioned for a good year and there's a high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy, or semiconductor, material science, life sciences or the Astral, right, [indiscernible] just incredible demand for those technologies. So we're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business. Good morning Derik. Stephen, why don't you... Good morning Doug, welcome back. Sure. So Doug, thanks for the question. In terms of the long-range outlook, right, we raised our outlook in late in 2021. And what that -- at that moment, we can't remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%, right. We were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market, right. And in terms of our ability to gain share, three points, I think -- two, three, I use three for simplicity. Three points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to. And we've been delivering that for a while, and we've been growing share for a really long while for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there. In terms of the market growth, where the market was extraordinary when we set it, we said 4% to 6% was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3% to 5%. And the change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there. When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well positioned to grow, for simplicity, three points faster than that, so 7% to 9%. So while I get the question a lot and obviously, in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long-term health of the industry. I've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying, if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, you're probably at 6% long-term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth. But you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment because this -- we really are a GDP-plus-type business in terms of the markets that we serve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it and while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position. In terms of the below the line, the very high-level concept, I do believe that as you see volumes grow at more normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow-through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math as you have some level of headwind embedded in the easier numbers, nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step-up that one would expect to have. So Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about the performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future, last year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business. Really, the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results. I think that in a way, we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as what actually was going on because there's so many different things we were communicating. But if I think about clinical research, it's a little over two years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition. Customers love the business performing well, colleagues doing a great job. And it's been a big success. The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines, and at the same time, delivered by far the fastest, I'll call it, underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it. And that means for this year, we have both a roll-off, which we've given transparency to on a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison, which is cool. Like we -- that's a good challenge to have in terms of the great performance. So we would expect that the business' growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons. But the future, meaning looking out into 2025 and beyond, this is a really strong business, long-term, high single-digit growth business plus the synergies it's driving. So I feel really great about that. And then a quick comment just on China and which is unrelated to clinical research but sort of the other element of your question. China, market conditions were challenged in 2023. First quarter was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then -- so that was China effectively. We're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year. Rather, we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds. So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point, the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus. Whether that's direct or confidence or whatever it does, we don't know when that will happen. But at some point, it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high. So I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it will take some time to get there. Thanks, Vijay. Go ahead. Sure. So thanks for the question. In terms of China, a market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society, right, and created American jobs as part of it. Better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population, we have a great reputation. I've had the honor of being the Chair of the U.S.-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the U.S. administration and the Chinese government. And while it's clear to me that the short-term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good. It will be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster-growing geographies in the long-term. In terms of the relations between the countries, yes, I agree with your sentiment, there is a thawing. And in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications. And my quick read of what they're working on in this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving Federal Government-related entities. So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously, as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well positioned to support the U.S. government. So thank you for the question. Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks everyone for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum. We're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we had expected in the quarter, and through the great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind, so really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all the while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science.  Let me now provide you some additional details in our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, we delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tail end of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5% and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic related revenue, $330 million of testing and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue.  Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year. In Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits.  With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization, this is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI business system. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%.  Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023.  Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year-over-year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in this segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39% and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segments, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our Pharma Services business within 2023 as had been expected. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022. Let me now turn to guidance, and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year, our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year. Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year-over-year, the combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to zero. We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024 and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we closed the acquisition of Olink by midyear. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 2023. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. Let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of step back on that and then -- and hopefully help frame your question. So we provided an early framing for 2024 on our last call, and we had the insight on how Q4 played out and have completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significant. The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. It includes the latest view on FX, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing. And then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past three months is a discrete item in our Pharma Services business. We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. Would have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 2024. Now the accounting is finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in 2025. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 2024, and that's had some impact on -- in terms of the reported core growth. And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So things are more helpful for our investors and the range of outcomes for the year. Now the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out as we see it today. And the range is about $1 billion to a revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company. But hopefully, it kind of tees up kind of the framing for the guide. In terms of the margin profile for the -- we finished the year at exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. So when I see some of the pre-call notes, this is, I think, a little bit different in terms of what some expectations. But from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected. And then from margins going forward, I think the margin profile that we have today, I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are on landing point on margins for the segments is probably a good starting point for the -- to think about for the year ahead. Yes. Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP-1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial costs in the interim in 2024, which will create good accretive growth going forward. That's one good example. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company. And we're not lessening our drive here to really drive great long-term growth. So we're appropriately managing our cost, top line environment, but we're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place and to make sure that, that top line environment stays and the outlook stays as good as we -- as much as articulated. Yes. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year-over-year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year-over-year -- so there's -- obviously, we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp. That's just under 200 basis points in total and then about 100 basis points contribution from the core business despite the lower dollars of revenue. And the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So to give you a way to frame the margin in Q1. And then yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as the revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead. Thanks Vijay."

My name is Ellen and I'll be the operator for today's call. During the presentation, all lines will be on mute. However, there will be an opportunity for a question-and-answer session at the end. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\nRafael Tejada: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is, Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading News Events and Presentations until November 10, 2023. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2023 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any dates subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in the press release of our third quarter 2023 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter and then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing play out in the macro-economy and the implications for our guidance. In the third quarter, our revenue was $10.57 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 8% to $2.56 billion, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin 200 basis points to 24.2% -- 24.2%, and we delivered excellent growth in adjusted EPS, achieving a 12% increase to $5.69 per share. We delivered a very strong third quarter. In the quarter, the market environment continued to get more challenging. So I thought that it would be best to update you on what we're seeing and the implications on our guidance for the full year. As a reminder, coming out of the second quarter, we assumed core market growth to be in the zero to 2% range for the year, driven by two factors, cautious customer spending and low economic activity in China. As we indicated in September, those same two factors increased in impact and we now expect core market growth to be slightly negative for the year. Our team did a good job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the quarter and we continue to expect to grow faster than the market for the full year and to once again deliver share gain in 2023. Factoring in the current macroeconomic conditions that I discussed, as well as the related increase in FX headwinds, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2023. We now expect revenue to be $42.7 billion and adjusted EPS to be $21.50 per share. Stephen will outline the underlying assumptions later in the call, along with some thoughts to help frame 2024. So as I look ahead, the combination of our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System will enable us to successfully navigate dynamic times, positioning us to deliver differentiated short-term performance and simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The long-term prospect for our industry remain as bright as ever. Science continues to advance at a rapid pace and our tools are used by scientists for the most important work that they do, providing the foundation for the scientific breakthroughs they enable. And our capabilities enable the pharma and biotech industry, which is addressing so many unmet healthcare needs. Let me now turn to our Q3 revenue performance in the context of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth declined 1% for the quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a headwind in this customer segment. In Q3, performance in this end-market was led by our pharma services business. In academic and government, we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In industrial and applied, growth was flat for the third quarter. Performance in this end-market was led by our electron microscopy business. And finally, diagnostics and healthcare, in Q3 revenue was approximately 20% lower than the prior-year quarter. In this end-market, the team delivered good core business growth highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostics businesses. We made strong progress on our growth strategy in Q3. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with innovation, it was another great quarter for the company. We launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses that are further strengthening our industry leadership and providing our customers with new technologies to enable breakthroughs in their work. Let me start with a brief update on the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Astral, which we launched at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry in June. Demand has been very strong and it's great to see these instruments being so quickly adopted by our customers for their protein discovery research. In the quarter, we launched the EXENT Solution in Europe after receiving IVDR certification. It's the latest innovation from our protein diagnostics business, which as you know became part of Thermo Fisher with the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. EXENT complements our leading portfolio of assays that help to diagnose and monitor blood protein abnormalities related to multiple myeloma and other disorders. In our bioproduction business, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. And in our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Hydro Bio Plasma focused ion beam, providing high-resolution imaging along with a simplified workflow for cell biologists. And earlier this week, Time Magazine selected Thermo Fisher's preeclampsia test as one of Time's 2023 best innovation -- best inventions. As you may recall, this is the first and only immunoassay to aid in the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia and it received FDA breakthrough designation and clearance earlier in the year. Now turning to the trusted partner status we've earned with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. As you know, we've had strong demand for our biologics drug substance manufacturing capabilities. And during the quarter, we completed an expansion of our site in St. Louis, Missouri. This facility supports therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune conditions and rare genetic disorders. It features our new Thermo Scientific high-performer DynaDrive 5,000-liter single-use bioreactor, which is a significant advancement in single-use technology. The DynaDrive offers better performance and is scalable to much larger volumes than previous generation bioreactors. We also further strengthened our clinical research offering by opening a facility in Ohio to produce sample collection kits for clinical trials. This enables us to deliver customized kits to our clients and provide greater supply-chain stability to support their trucks. As always, our PPI Business System in our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and powers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and customer regions while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am proud of our team's efforts, which resulted in strong operating margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. It's been a very active year. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the Binding Site in January. The business is performing exceedingly well. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. As a reminder, real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies, are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in the post-approval setting. The business is now part of our clinical research business and it's off to a great start. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we announced the agreement to acquire Olink, a company that is accelerating proteomics. Olink's products enable leading academic researchers and the biopharmaceutical companies to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. Its proprietary technology Proximity Extension Assay provides high-throughput protein analysis. The acquisition of Olink underscores the profound impact that proteomics is having as our customers continue to advance life science research and precision medicine. This technology is highly complementary to our leading mass spectrometry and life sciences platforms, and we're uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. We expect to deliver $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies in year five, driven by revenue synergies and cost efficiencies. We expect this business to be a mid-teens revenue growth business for us well into the future. The transaction is targeted to be closed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. So, 2023 has been an active year of M&A that further strengthened Thermo Fisher Scientific for the future. During the quarter, we continued to advance our environmental, social and governance priorities. This included launching a collaboration with the National Minority Quality Forum, a not-for-profit research and education organization to help bring clinical research to historically underserved patient populations through their alliance or representative clinical trials. The collaboration supports pharma and biotech customers in meeting regulatory expectations to enroll and retain patients in clinical trials, who more fully reflect real-world populations experiencing the disease or health condition being studied. And it also helps to enable our customers to meet US Food and Drug Administration requirements around diversity action plans. In terms of our environmental sustainability efforts, we've officially surpassed our original goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. As we previously announced, we've increased our target to a 50% reduction by 2030, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success but also by creating a greater work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the third quarter. We delivered a strong operating performance in Q3, driven by our team's execution and the power of our PPI Business System. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment, we're taking the right actions and appropriately managing the company, and we're incredibly focused on delivering differentiated short-term performance while simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry remains unchanged and we're uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities and exit this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just outlined, while the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the third quarter, we continued to deliver differentiated performance. In Q3, we delivered $10.6 billion of revenue, which included 1% core organic revenue growth. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS, a 12% increase over Q3 last year. We're continuing to successfully navigate the current environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.42. On the top line, reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, 1% contribution from acquisitions and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe grew in the low single-digits, Asia-Pacific declined in the low single-digits with China declining in the high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 24.2%, 200 basis points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization. This is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42%, 30 basis points higher than Q3 last year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 14.8% of revenue, an improvement of 140 basis points over Q3 last year. Total R&D expense was $320 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.7% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, which is similar to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, which is 180 basis points lower than Q3 last year, reflecting results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q3, approximately 7 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3.7 billion, after investing $1 billion of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and we deployed just over $900 million of capital for the acquisition of CorEvitas. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net-debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segments and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. Let me continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 18% and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven predominantly by the run-off of our pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 35.9%, up 80 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and had favorable FX, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q3 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 21% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Turing to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q3 reported revenue increased 2% and organic revenue was 6% lower than the prior-year quarter. In Q3, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 29% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, which is 550 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered a favorable volume mix and very strong productivity. That was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 3% and organic growth was 1%. During Q3, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, which is 340 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and a favorable mix, which is partially offset by FX. Let me now turn to guidance. As Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect the more challenging macroeconomic environment. Our revised estimate for 2023 is revenue of $42.7 billion with core organic revenue growth of just under 1%, and $21.50 of adjusted EPS. Let me now provide you with some details behind the changing guidance versus the estimate we provided on our last earnings call. Starting with revenue, our revised guidance is $850 million lower than the prior outlook. $200 million of this is driven by an increased headwind from FX. We've increased our guide by $45 million to reflect the acquisition of CorEvitas, and the rest of the change is due to our lower core revenue assumption. We now see core organic growth for the year of just under 1%, which is a little less than 2% lower than the prior guide. This is driven by the same factors that we've seen throughout the year, the weak economic conditions in China and cautious spending in general across our customer base. And as we indicated during Q3, these factors increased in impact during the quarter and our assumption is that the conditions we saw at the end of Q3 will continue throughout the remainder of the year, and as a result, we now expect core market growth for our industry to be slightly negative for the year. However, we continue to effectively navigate the macro-dynamics and expect to continue to deliver differentiated core organic revenue growth for the year despite the more challenging conditions. Moving on to profitability. The revised guidance assumes a pull-through on the lower revenue of just over 40%, and we now expect our adjusted operating margin to be 22.9% for the year. We continue to use the PPI Business System to manage our costs appropriately given the market conditions. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, the revised guidance is $0.17 lower due to FX and $0.69 related to the change in core revenue. So we now expect to deliver $21.50 of adjusted EPS in 2023, a strong result given the challenging macro-environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details of the updated 2023 guidance. We continue to assume that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. We expect the total vaccines and therapies-related revenue will be $1.6 billion less than the prior year, an impact of over 4% on our core organic revenue growth. This assumes we recognized $1.3 billion of vaccine therapies revenue in 2023, $600 million of which is in our clinical research business. Moving on to FX. Given recent rate changes, we're now assuming that FX will be a year-over-year headwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $0.28 which is $0.17 more of a headwind than our previous guidance. The Binding Site and CorEvitas acquisitions are performing well, and we now assume that they'll contribute approximately $300 million to our reported revenue growth for the year. Below the line, we now expect just under $500 million of net interest expense in 2023, a slight increase reflecting the acquisition of CorEvitas. We continue to assume that the adjusted tax rate for the -- 2023 will be 10%, and we're now expecting net capital expenditures will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. And we now expect the free cash flow will be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January, $3.7 billion in acquisitions completed this year, and $3.1 billion committed to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close in 2024. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares, and then we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So before I conclude my prepared remarks, I thought it'd be helpful to share some more detailed thoughts around how to frame 2024. At this point in time, a good starting assumption is that our core organic revenue growth in 2024 is similar to 2023, approximately 1% growth. With our proven growth strategy, we expect to continue to take share and that would mean market growth in 2024 will be similar to 2023 with the market declining 1 to 2 points. In terms of phasing of our core organic revenue growth, it's best to assume a more challenging first half and then moderate growth in the second half. The pandemic-related revenues both testing and total vaccines and therapies are likely to be around $300 million in 2024. This is a headwind of approximately $1.3 billion, or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue $175 million year-over-year. That's a combination of six months of Olink, and the inorganic portion of the CorEvitas revenue in 2024. And based on current rates, we would expect FX to be a headwind to revenue in 2024 of approximately $375 million, just under 1%. So wrapping all this together, 2024 revenue dollars will be very similar to 2023. In terms of adjusted operating income dollars, with this top-line setup, we would expect to deliver similar adjusted operating income dollars through 2023. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to manage costs very carefully but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to continue to strengthen our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls are expected to offset the run-off in the remaining pandemic revenue, inflation and the normalization of incentive compensation across the company and appropriate investments in our colleagues. Below-the-line and the interest income benefit from our cash generation and an assumption of $3 billion of buybacks in 2024 would more than offset the impact of a slight increase in our tax rate to 10.5%. All of this would enable us to deliver around $21.75 of adjusted EPS for the year. So the high-level summary is that with these assumptions, we'd expect 2024 core organic revenue growth to be similar to 2023. And then our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System would enable us to continue to manage the macro conditions and the run-off in pandemic revenue very effectively, so we can deliver revenue and profitability similar to 2023 and a slight increase in adjusted EPS. Now, should the market conditions be better than I just outlined, our growth strategy and proven execution capabilities will enable us to deliver the upside benefit. I look forward to providing you a formal guidance for 2024 on our next earnings call along with our usual supporting details for the year ahead. At that point, we'll have the insight from a full year of 2023, we'll have a better view on the macro conditions entering 2024. So in conclusion, we continue to navigate the environment really well, delivering differentiated financials and further strengthening our industry leadership. We remain really well-positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities as market growth normalizes over time. And as we think about our cost base, we're really well-positioned to drive strongly accretive growth going forward. Now let me turn the call-back over to, Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now enter our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nJack Meehan: Good morning, and thank you for all the color. Marc, a bigger-picture question. Upon greater reflection, how much of your decision to raise the long-term target to 7% to 9% do you think may have been based on the environment we're in? And I was curious, do you think it's prudent for investors to think of something lower than that in the medium term?\nMarc Casper: Yeah. Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about the long-term guidance or our long-term targets, what's underlying it is 4% to 6% growth, right? I don't think there is any controversy -- market growth -- 4% to 6% market -- I don't think there is any controversy that we're going to grow meaningfully faster because if you look at the last 10 or 15 years, we've delivered superior organic growth and it keeps getting better and better relative to the market, right. So, the spread of 2, 3 points better than that, that's not in question, right, so at 4% to 6%, you get to the 7% to 9%. When I think about my 20-plus years in this industry, thinking about what the historical growth is, what the drivers are for the growth, I feel 4% to 6% long-term market growth is actually the appropriate number that the things that the industry are going through now do not change my view that the long-term health of this industry is exceptionally bright and that you will see that return. And I can't call when exactly that returns, but what I can say is that the unmet healthcare needs and all the drivers that we talked about at our Analyst Day remain extraordinarily bright for the future. So thank you, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up. The deterioration, kind of, in the market we've seen since second quarter earnings or even early September, what are you hearing from customers, like, as you try and diagnose what's happening here? And just what are your thoughts on kind of the recent increase in the 10-year -- how does that impact kind of the pace of the recovery as you see it?\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So I've been out with customers. As you know, I do that a lot. I've been out on a definitely out there with our customer tour, both in Europe and the US, and earlier in the quarter, I was in China. So when I think about what our customers are saying, they are actually very bullish on the mid to long term, right? So there's quite a lot of opportunities for us. What I would say is short term, if you're visiting a smaller biotech customer, what you're seeing is concerns about when the funding environment is going to improve. So there's a level of caution. And I think that's generally across the customer base as customers are being cautious after a very robust pandemic period. But long term and the excitement and customers looking forward to the future with us, it's extremely positive. Anything on the non-term interest rate?\nStephen Williamson: No, I wouldn't think about the long-term interest rate. I think from a funding standpoint, I think there's a spread between interest rates and then what the kind of return we people are going to get on an investment. And as the valuation expectations moderate for our customers, that, I think the funding will start flowing better going forward. The timing of that will still be played out, but the return profile and the successful investment in biotech is still incredibly compelling. So long term, that will moderate appropriately.\nRafael Tejada: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Jack. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Thank you. Thanks for the questions, guys. Maybe, Marc and Steve -- Stephen, excuse me, it's somewhat hard to reconcile just the magnitude of this end-market weakness just given the view towards the structural attractiveness of the -- kind of the customer drivers. So maybe could you just give us a lens on this outlook for '24, maybe first from like a geographic perspective China, how much of is that a driver towards like other reasons? And then B, it would be great to just learn about like within biopharma, your largest customer base, maybe some of the underlying factors that kind of pointed as very weak growth in bioprocess, pharma R&D. Marc, you just mentioned pre-commercial biotech. Just give us a little more color on what's driving you know the real, kind of, contracted growth outlook.\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So, Dan, thanks for the question. I think the way that Stephen and I thought about giving an early view to 2024 is not based on us having finished our operating plan process which we do in December, and then when we actually lay out guidance, we do it based on how did the year finish, all of the details by business, by geography and then we figure out the details. We took the benefit of each of us having 20-plus years of experience in the industry, looking at the market conditions that we see today, and basically went through the assumptions of how could 2024 play out based on what we know today, right? So this is not a bottoms-up view by country, by geography and by business unit, but rather based on experience and based on what we're seeing. So when I think about for us next year, all right, we try to give you incredible clarity about what's COVID in our numbers, right? So we're expecting a run-off of $1.3 billion of COVID-related revenue in 2024, that would leave $300 million of revenue in 2024, of which we have a pretty good line-of-sight to what those activity is, right? So that's the first assumption. And then the second assumption is effectively what's going on in the base business, meaning, excluding the COVID-related business, and that should be a little bit over 3% growth, right? So if you think of those two factors, that's how you get to a core number of one. Remember that testing is part of the decline. So that's the set of assumptions. So then there is another lens to think about it, which is comparisons, right, or the -- we're going to lap the customer caution, different businesses at different points in time, but the first half will have more difficult comparisons, haven't fully seen the effect of caution. The second half, you actually get to more --you're back to kind of moderate growth in that period of time just based on that factor. And then we look at some of our businesses like our insurance business, which had the benefit this year of the disruptions from supply-chain in 2021 and 2022, and we're able to catch-up on orders that needed to be shipped and that gave us a little bit of a benefit of growth this year, of which, that obviously doesn't repeat next year. We factored all that in and we said, core is pretty similar to what it is next year. We look forward to actually doing the detailed guidance at the end of January, early February when we have our earnings call, and we'll have all of our puts and takes and be a lot smarter. But we wanted our analyst community to be aligned with what we're seeing today because there's quite a big disconnect in the numbers that are out there for 2024 relative to the numbers that we articulated today.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks, Marc. Maybe just a follow-up on biopharma since it's\u2026\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Dan.\nDan Brennan: I'm sorry about that. Maybe just a follow-up on biopharma since it is your biggest customer base and such a key driver. Could you just give us a little bit of a window, just maybe what you're seeing in Q3, kind of how you're thinking about Q4 is maybe a jumping-off point for '24, large pharma R&D spending, bioprocess, PPD? Can you give us some flavor on your key customer segments and kind of what the trends look like right now, and that will give us some vantage point for how we think about '24 there as well? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Dan, I think your fellow analysts are throwing tomatoes at your building today. You're asking 19 questions in that one, but I'll start at a high level and leave some of this for others. Let me break the pharma -- biopharma into what revenue was in Q3 and then a little bit of -- some of the underlying dynamics. Actually, the revenue in the quarter was incredibly similar to the prior quarter, right, in terms of how we actually performed. We declined 1%. And looking at that, the long-term outlook here is strong. We talked about that in an earlier question. Effectively, customer caution increased a bit. You'll see that more pronounced in biotech and pharma, but you see it across the customer set. That's more of a forward-looking look. I think the thing that probably is most relevant and why we think about our fourth quarter the way we do, one of the things that we assumed in our previous guidance was that in our bioprocessing business, that orders would stabilize, start to normalize in the third quarter. We did not see that, right? Obviously, what's the single biggest driver of the same factors in Q4 versus what we talked about really is bioproduction. We didn't see that normalization of orders. In general, that business operates on a roughly 13-week lead time. So if you don't see the orders in Q3, you're not going to see the revenue step-up in Q4. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of framing. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get some of the other ones in future questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Dan. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi. Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Marc, you just typically haven't called out COVID impact to PPD -- the biopharma services business in the past. Can you just sort of clarify what that was in '22 and '23 overall so we can get the number? And also staying on that segment, Pfizer and Moderna are big customers of yours. They both sort of announced some R&D cuts. How should we sort of think about how that flows through the business? And I guess is there any sort of like vaccine revenues that in that business, were there any sort like take or pays that are sort of in there? So I know it's a lot on that, but just start there.\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So they're great questions. So let's talk about clinical research one level above and then I'll give you some of the answers to the question you have. All right. So we are almost at the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of PPD, which closed in early December of 2021. Business is doing great, right, and it's been a terrific acquisition. It is a terrific acquisition with a bright future. If you think about what the moment-in-time was in December of 2021, PPD had done a great job of growing its core sort of normal business and played a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for vaccines and therapies, just a phenomenally relevant set of capabilities, which is part of the reason we knew how great the business was and how respected it was in the industry. Since our ownership, we've modeled in that this would be a declining portion of the business. It's actually been a headwind through all of our ownership on core organic growth, right? So if I think about -- so our core organic would actually been higher than if we didn't include it. But our view was, this business' end-market growth was really good and we're just going to grow through it and it was factored into our guidance. Obviously, as customer caution has increased in pharmaceutical and biotech, the rates of growth in our non-COVID business slows. And we wanted to ensure that our investors understood that that was actually quite healthy, but we're going through the run-off on vaccines and therapies. To give you the magnitude of the number, what is embedded in our 2023 is a $600 million decline in revenue for vaccines and therapies, and it also happens to be $600 million of activity in the year. So that's this year, and as opposed to sort of take or pay or those things, clinical trials are different, but you have patients enrolled, you go through it. So that revenue will run off in an orderly fashion over the next couple of years in the outlook that we gave of $300 million of total revenue for all pandemic related. Some of that -- most of it is actually that work in clinical research. There's a little bit of take or pay in pharma services and nominal amount of testing. So hopefully that gives you a good sense of the dynamic there.\nDerik de Bruin: Right. So if we just think about underlying growth of the core PPD business, just sort of like, what's your embedded number for this year, and sort of like the working assumption for next year? Just, as I said, there's just a lot of variables. I think just some clarity would help.\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So obviously, we'll get into some of that. We don't even do it by business unit in our guidance. So -- but I can give you sort of direction how to think about it. What we have said at the time of the acquisition and what we've said consistently is the long-term growth expectation for this business is high-single-digits plus the benefit of synergies. And that hasn't changed in terms of the long term. Our assumption has been that it would step down from the 20% and then sort of double-digit growth to that, and then actually it will step down below that and bounce back up just on the math of the COVID -- the COVID activity run-off over the next year or so. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how to think about modeling it.\nDerik de Bruin: Yeah.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Then just one more if I can. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So appreciate all the color that you've given us today on 2024, but for two areas that I wanted to follow up on. First, how do you see China playing out next year? At this point, is growth in the region going to be reasonable in 2024? Are we going to be looking at declines? And now you've noted that 2024 is also going to be more of a back-half weighted story given those market dynamics. So could you walk us through the magnitude of the step-up that you're expecting between the first half and second half? And how much of that is really going to be driven by easier comps in the back half versus an expected rebound in the market?\nMarc Casper: So, Rachel, thanks. Let me start with China. And I think it's really relevant for the community to understand our view on what's going on in China, right? So first of all, it was great to return to China, which I did in August. And actually came away with -- and way more encouraged on the long term. So let me give you a little bit more detail on it. I went to China with two different hats. One is the Chair of the US-China Business Council, where I had the opportunity to interact with senior members of the Chinese government, including the premier. And then I also did my normal thing of being CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific and had the opportunity to see our colleagues, visit sites and see a lot of customers during that process. So this is what I came away with from my visit. Economy is definitely challenged, and the conditions are worsening, and we saw that worsening during the quarter. The government is actively working to boost business confidence and create a stronger environment for foreign investment. So when I think about the kind of the macro picture, short-term, definitely a challenge from a macro-economy. I was pleasantly surprised that a real focus on a better environment for foreign companies, which bodes well for the future. When I think about the outlook here, we definitely saw the impact of the declining economy in the results and we would expect that that will continue. And we can't predict exactly when the market will do. But we know that the comparisons get easier in the second half for China as we lap some of the comparables -- or the more challenging comparables. When I think about phasing for the year and all of all of that stuff, we look forward to doing that in beginning of 2024.\nStephen Williamson: Yeah. But, Rachel, that kind of set up what I put in the prepared remarks, is kind of a mirror image of this year as a starting point, kind of more challenging in the first half and then modest growth in the second half. Thanks, Rachel.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then if I could squeeze one more just on instrumentation. That was a great spot this quarter at 8% growth. You've noted that you're over-indexed to instrumentation in China, and you've also highlighted some of the incremental weakness there. So can you just walk us through what exactly you're seeing in that portfolio? What was instrument growth in China versus rest of world? And then how should we think about that setup for instrumentation next year given you're going to face some of these difficult comps in the first three quarters?\nMarc Casper: So I'll probably keep it at a pretty high level. Awesome quarter in Analytical Instruments, 8% growth. Team is doing a good job. Our electron microscopy business, really performing extremely well. And great to see the uptake on Astral, which is our breakthrough mass spectrometer, which we launched in June. So those are the highlights. Our guidance for this year and our framing for next year reflects the customer caution and the non-repeat of some of the -- working through the disruptions of the pandemic on supply chain. So that's embedded in the outlook for the year.\nStephen Williamson: And then Rachel, just on the kind of the additional kind of weakness we saw in China in Q3, some of that came through in revenue in Q3, but it's going to be more in terms of revenue in Q4 because of a lag in terms of bookings profile for an instrumentation business. So that's part of that dynamic of why Q4 is more impacted by the change profile that we saw in China.\nRafael Tejada: Thanks, Rachel.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah. Thanks, Marc, Stephen. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll wrap two of my questions into one. First, largely on M&A. Given the environment right now, the type of deals that you're doing, the type of valuations you're doing at, could you maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing out there? Obviously, Olink, prior to that Binding Site and CorEvitas. Is that the type of sort of midsized deals that we should continue to expect here and the opportunity base that you are seeing in M&A? And within the proteomics franchise, now with successful Orbitrap franchise of last 15-plus years, combining that with Olink, Marc, maybe at a high level, could you provide us your, not for lack of better word, vision on proteomics despite being a sort of a tough market this year and next year?\nMarc Casper: Yeah. So Puneet, thanks for the question. And, so when I think about the M&A for this year or M&A even in general, the criteria that we use, right, is M&A that's going to be highly valued by our customers, strengthen our strategic position, generate strong returns for our shareholders. And you look at what the different opportunities are and you think about it in different periods of time where it's going to skew in your favor. And this year, with a more volatile macro, we've been able to add three phenomenal businesses, right, in terms of strengthening the company with incredible growth prospects, really good return profiles. So that doesn't mean that next year will look exactly like this or years where you can buy companies that are really more of a balance of cost and revenue growth in those different things and different aspects of it. But this year, to be able to get the Binding Site, CorEvitas and Olink, it's fantastic. And when I think about Olink, which, this is our first opportunity given that we had announced it during a blackout period, it's just a terrific fit, right, and you think about it's a leader in a business that has gone through that phase of being well adopted, right? So the technology risk isn't here anymore. But it hasn't globally commercialized. It hasn't reached nearly its full potential and incredibly complementary to our leading position in mass spectrometry and proteomics. And Puneet, thanks for reminding others about our 15-year plus track record with Orbitrap. Astral being the next big many year run and the combination there, plus Olink, and the fact that we have a leading position in the life sciences instrumentation, which are very relevant in terms of qPCR for these products as well. Really exciting. They are a leader in their field and we're excited to help bring that to the customer base in an accelerated fashion. And when we look to the future, we expect this to be a long-term, mid-teens-plus growth business and be able to generate really significant adjusted operating income synergies driven by that accelerated revenue growth, right? And on top of that, just $125 million of earnings that come from the year five synergies, and that's going to generate double-digit returns for the shareholders. So super exciting time, and we'll continue to be outstanding stewards of our shareholders' capital.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eve Burstein from Bernstein. Eve, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nEve Burstein: Hi, there. Good morning, and thanks a lot for the question. I'd love to ask about your lab products and biopharma services business unit. So the operating margin there was up right at 16%. It was higher than any point in the past. And when you talk about the puts and takes there, you called out productivity and mix as some of the positive drivers. So just two questions there. One, on mix, if that was a positive driver, does that actually mean that sales of some of your really low margin consumables were down? Other peer companies have talked about challenges there and brought down guidance in general lab products. So can you talk a little bit about those dynamics? And then secondly, on productivity gains, what is driving that? And are those going to be sustainable and recurring over time?\nStephen Williamson: So, it\u2019s Steve. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin dynamic in that segment, yeah, mix is -- when you think about where the more challenging environment is in terms of customer caution and China, that impacts the lab products business and then the wider customer caution also impacts our channel business, so relative to the other business in that segment, where the mix profile comes from. In terms of productivity, it's about -- we've been rightsizing the cost base within our lab products business and given the volume change. So that's where the majority of that is. And then just good spending wisely across the whole business, but those are probably the two main factors to call out. Thanks, Eve.\nEve Burstein: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Perfect. We will take our last question today from Dan Leonard from [UBS] (ph). Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you for the time and really appreciate you sharing all those framing thoughts for 2024. I have a couple of additional follow-ups on that but I'll keep it to one. I know it's not a bottoms-up view, but I'm curious how you're thinking about the inventory effect either for your business or the market in 2024. In those areas where there's been inventory burn-down in 2023, whether it be in bioproduction or the channels business or wherever you're seeing it, what do you think is a reasonable assumption for 2024? Is it reasonable to assume the burn-down concludes and demand can match customer usage? Just any high-level thoughts. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: So good question. When I think about the -- it's primarily a bioproduction story. And I don't think anyone is smart enough to know exactly which quarter. But during 2024, do I think that we will get back to orders matching revenue at some point during the year? Yeah. So I think that we'll be smarter with the benefit of another three months of time to see what our view is on 2024. But I don't think we'll be talking throughout the year about inventory reduction in the customer side because there's activity that's going on currently that's consuming the inventory that's out there. Great. So let me bring to just a quick wrap up for the call. Thank you for joining us today. We're very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you in the new year.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference for everybody. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just outlined, while the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the third quarter, we continued to deliver differentiated performance. In Q3, we delivered $10.6 billion of revenue, which included 1% core organic revenue growth. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS, a 12% increase over Q3 last year. We're continuing to successfully navigate the current environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.42. On the top line, reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, 1% contribution from acquisitions and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe grew in the low single-digits, Asia-Pacific declined in the low single-digits with China declining in the high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 24.2%, 200 basis points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization. This is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42%, 30 basis points higher than Q3 last year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 14.8% of revenue, an improvement of 140 basis points over Q3 last year. Total R&D expense was $320 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.7% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, which is similar to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, which is 180 basis points lower than Q3 last year, reflecting results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q3, approximately 7 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3.7 billion, after investing $1 billion of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and we deployed just over $900 million of capital for the acquisition of CorEvitas. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net-debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segments and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. Let me continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 18% and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven predominantly by the run-off of our pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 35.9%, up 80 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and had favorable FX, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q3 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 21% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Turing to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q3 reported revenue increased 2% and organic revenue was 6% lower than the prior-year quarter. In Q3, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 29% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, which is 550 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered a favorable volume mix and very strong productivity. That was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 3% and organic growth was 1%. During Q3, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, which is 340 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and a favorable mix, which is partially offset by FX. Let me now turn to guidance. As Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect the more challenging macroeconomic environment. Our revised estimate for 2023 is revenue of $42.7 billion with core organic revenue growth of just under 1%, and $21.50 of adjusted EPS. Let me now provide you with some details behind the changing guidance versus the estimate we provided on our last earnings call. Starting with revenue, our revised guidance is $850 million lower than the prior outlook. $200 million of this is driven by an increased headwind from FX. We've increased our guide by $45 million to reflect the acquisition of CorEvitas, and the rest of the change is due to our lower core revenue assumption. We now see core organic growth for the year of just under 1%, which is a little less than 2% lower than the prior guide. This is driven by the same factors that we've seen throughout the year, the weak economic conditions in China and cautious spending in general across our customer base. And as we indicated during Q3, these factors increased in impact during the quarter and our assumption is that the conditions we saw at the end of Q3 will continue throughout the remainder of the year, and as a result, we now expect core market growth for our industry to be slightly negative for the year. However, we continue to effectively navigate the macro-dynamics and expect to continue to deliver differentiated core organic revenue growth for the year despite the more challenging conditions. Moving on to profitability. The revised guidance assumes a pull-through on the lower revenue of just over 40%, and we now expect our adjusted operating margin to be 22.9% for the year. We continue to use the PPI Business System to manage our costs appropriately given the market conditions. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, the revised guidance is $0.17 lower due to FX and $0.69 related to the change in core revenue. So we now expect to deliver $21.50 of adjusted EPS in 2023, a strong result given the challenging macro-environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details of the updated 2023 guidance. We continue to assume that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. We expect the total vaccines and therapies-related revenue will be $1.6 billion less than the prior year, an impact of over 4% on our core organic revenue growth. This assumes we recognized $1.3 billion of vaccine therapies revenue in 2023, $600 million of which is in our clinical research business. Moving on to FX. Given recent rate changes, we're now assuming that FX will be a year-over-year headwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $0.28 which is $0.17 more of a headwind than our previous guidance. The Binding Site and CorEvitas acquisitions are performing well, and we now assume that they'll contribute approximately $300 million to our reported revenue growth for the year. Below the line, we now expect just under $500 million of net interest expense in 2023, a slight increase reflecting the acquisition of CorEvitas. We continue to assume that the adjusted tax rate for the -- 2023 will be 10%, and we're now expecting net capital expenditures will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. And we now expect the free cash flow will be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January, $3.7 billion in acquisitions completed this year, and $3.1 billion committed to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close in 2024. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares, and then we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So before I conclude my prepared remarks, I thought it'd be helpful to share some more detailed thoughts around how to frame 2024. At this point in time, a good starting assumption is that our core organic revenue growth in 2024 is similar to 2023, approximately 1% growth. With our proven growth strategy, we expect to continue to take share and that would mean market growth in 2024 will be similar to 2023 with the market declining 1 to 2 points. In terms of phasing of our core organic revenue growth, it's best to assume a more challenging first half and then moderate growth in the second half. The pandemic-related revenues both testing and total vaccines and therapies are likely to be around $300 million in 2024. This is a headwind of approximately $1.3 billion, or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue $175 million year-over-year. That's a combination of six months of Olink, and the inorganic portion of the CorEvitas revenue in 2024. And based on current rates, we would expect FX to be a headwind to revenue in 2024 of approximately $375 million, just under 1%. So wrapping all this together, 2024 revenue dollars will be very similar to 2023. In terms of adjusted operating income dollars, with this top-line setup, we would expect to deliver similar adjusted operating income dollars through 2023. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to manage costs very carefully but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to continue to strengthen our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls are expected to offset the run-off in the remaining pandemic revenue, inflation and the normalization of incentive compensation across the company and appropriate investments in our colleagues. Below-the-line and the interest income benefit from our cash generation and an assumption of $3 billion of buybacks in 2024 would more than offset the impact of a slight increase in our tax rate to 10.5%. All of this would enable us to deliver around $21.75 of adjusted EPS for the year. So the high-level summary is that with these assumptions, we'd expect 2024 core organic revenue growth to be similar to 2023. And then our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System would enable us to continue to manage the macro conditions and the run-off in pandemic revenue very effectively, so we can deliver revenue and profitability similar to 2023 and a slight increase in adjusted EPS. Now, should the market conditions be better than I just outlined, our growth strategy and proven execution capabilities will enable us to deliver the upside benefit. I look forward to providing you a formal guidance for 2024 on our next earnings call along with our usual supporting details for the year ahead. At that point, we'll have the insight from a full year of 2023, we'll have a better view on the macro conditions entering 2024. So in conclusion, we continue to navigate the environment really well, delivering differentiated financials and further strengthening our industry leadership. We remain really well-positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities as market growth normalizes over time. And as we think about our cost base, we're really well-positioned to drive strongly accretive growth going forward. Now let me turn the call-back over to, Raf. No, I wouldn't think about the long-term interest rate. I think from a funding standpoint, I think there's a spread between interest rates and then what the kind of return we people are going to get on an investment. And as the valuation expectations moderate for our customers, that, I think the funding will start flowing better going forward. The timing of that will still be played out, but the return profile and the successful investment in biotech is still incredibly compelling. So long term, that will moderate appropriately. Yeah. But, Rachel, that kind of set up what I put in the prepared remarks, is kind of a mirror image of this year as a starting point, kind of more challenging in the first half and then modest growth in the second half. Thanks, Rachel. And then Rachel, just on the kind of the additional kind of weakness we saw in China in Q3, some of that came through in revenue in Q3, but it's going to be more in terms of revenue in Q4 because of a lag in terms of bookings profile for an instrumentation business. So that's part of that dynamic of why Q4 is more impacted by the change profile that we saw in China. So, it's Steve. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin dynamic in that segment, yeah, mix is -- when you think about where the more challenging environment is in terms of customer caution and China, that impacts the lab products business and then the wider customer caution also impacts our channel business, so relative to the other business in that segment, where the mix profile comes from. In terms of productivity, it's about -- we've been rightsizing the cost base within our lab products business and given the volume change. So that's where the majority of that is. And then just good spending wisely across the whole business, but those are probably the two main factors to call out. Thanks, Eve."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter and then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing play out in the macro-economy and the implications for our guidance. In the third quarter, our revenue was $10.57 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 8% to $2.56 billion, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin 200 basis points to 24.2% -- 24.2%, and we delivered excellent growth in adjusted EPS, achieving a 12% increase to $5.69 per share. We delivered a very strong third quarter. In the quarter, the market environment continued to get more challenging. So I thought that it would be best to update you on what we're seeing and the implications on our guidance for the full year. As a reminder, coming out of the second quarter, we assumed core market growth to be in the zero to 2% range for the year, driven by two factors, cautious customer spending and low economic activity in China. As we indicated in September, those same two factors increased in impact and we now expect core market growth to be slightly negative for the year. Our team did a good job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the quarter and we continue to expect to grow faster than the market for the full year and to once again deliver share gain in 2023. Factoring in the current macroeconomic conditions that I discussed, as well as the related increase in FX headwinds, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2023. We now expect revenue to be $42.7 billion and adjusted EPS to be $21.50 per share. Stephen will outline the underlying assumptions later in the call, along with some thoughts to help frame 2024. So as I look ahead, the combination of our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System will enable us to successfully navigate dynamic times, positioning us to deliver differentiated short-term performance and simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The long-term prospect for our industry remain as bright as ever. Science continues to advance at a rapid pace and our tools are used by scientists for the most important work that they do, providing the foundation for the scientific breakthroughs they enable. And our capabilities enable the pharma and biotech industry, which is addressing so many unmet healthcare needs. Let me now turn to our Q3 revenue performance in the context of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth declined 1% for the quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a headwind in this customer segment. In Q3, performance in this end-market was led by our pharma services business. In academic and government, we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In industrial and applied, growth was flat for the third quarter. Performance in this end-market was led by our electron microscopy business. And finally, diagnostics and healthcare, in Q3 revenue was approximately 20% lower than the prior-year quarter. In this end-market, the team delivered good core business growth highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostics businesses. We made strong progress on our growth strategy in Q3. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with innovation, it was another great quarter for the company. We launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses that are further strengthening our industry leadership and providing our customers with new technologies to enable breakthroughs in their work. Let me start with a brief update on the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Astral, which we launched at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry in June. Demand has been very strong and it's great to see these instruments being so quickly adopted by our customers for their protein discovery research. In the quarter, we launched the EXENT Solution in Europe after receiving IVDR certification. It's the latest innovation from our protein diagnostics business, which as you know became part of Thermo Fisher with the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. EXENT complements our leading portfolio of assays that help to diagnose and monitor blood protein abnormalities related to multiple myeloma and other disorders. In our bioproduction business, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. And in our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Hydro Bio Plasma focused ion beam, providing high-resolution imaging along with a simplified workflow for cell biologists. And earlier this week, Time Magazine selected Thermo Fisher's preeclampsia test as one of Time's 2023 best innovation -- best inventions. As you may recall, this is the first and only immunoassay to aid in the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia and it received FDA breakthrough designation and clearance earlier in the year. Now turning to the trusted partner status we've earned with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. As you know, we've had strong demand for our biologics drug substance manufacturing capabilities. And during the quarter, we completed an expansion of our site in St. Louis, Missouri. This facility supports therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune conditions and rare genetic disorders. It features our new Thermo Scientific high-performer DynaDrive 5,000-liter single-use bioreactor, which is a significant advancement in single-use technology. The DynaDrive offers better performance and is scalable to much larger volumes than previous generation bioreactors. We also further strengthened our clinical research offering by opening a facility in Ohio to produce sample collection kits for clinical trials. This enables us to deliver customized kits to our clients and provide greater supply-chain stability to support their trucks. As always, our PPI Business System in our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and powers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and customer regions while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am proud of our team's efforts, which resulted in strong operating margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. It's been a very active year. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the Binding Site in January. The business is performing exceedingly well. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. As a reminder, real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies, are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in the post-approval setting. The business is now part of our clinical research business and it's off to a great start. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we announced the agreement to acquire Olink, a company that is accelerating proteomics. Olink's products enable leading academic researchers and the biopharmaceutical companies to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. Its proprietary technology Proximity Extension Assay provides high-throughput protein analysis. The acquisition of Olink underscores the profound impact that proteomics is having as our customers continue to advance life science research and precision medicine. This technology is highly complementary to our leading mass spectrometry and life sciences platforms, and we're uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. We expect to deliver $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies in year five, driven by revenue synergies and cost efficiencies. We expect this business to be a mid-teens revenue growth business for us well into the future. The transaction is targeted to be closed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. So, 2023 has been an active year of M&A that further strengthened Thermo Fisher Scientific for the future. During the quarter, we continued to advance our environmental, social and governance priorities. This included launching a collaboration with the National Minority Quality Forum, a not-for-profit research and education organization to help bring clinical research to historically underserved patient populations through their alliance or representative clinical trials. The collaboration supports pharma and biotech customers in meeting regulatory expectations to enroll and retain patients in clinical trials, who more fully reflect real-world populations experiencing the disease or health condition being studied. And it also helps to enable our customers to meet US Food and Drug Administration requirements around diversity action plans. In terms of our environmental sustainability efforts, we've officially surpassed our original goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. As we previously announced, we've increased our target to a 50% reduction by 2030, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success but also by creating a greater work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the third quarter. We delivered a strong operating performance in Q3, driven by our team's execution and the power of our PPI Business System. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment, we're taking the right actions and appropriately managing the company, and we're incredibly focused on delivering differentiated short-term performance while simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry remains unchanged and we're uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities and exit this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yeah. Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about the long-term guidance or our long-term targets, what's underlying it is 4% to 6% growth, right? I don't think there is any controversy -- market growth -- 4% to 6% market -- I don't think there is any controversy that we're going to grow meaningfully faster because if you look at the last 10 or 15 years, we've delivered superior organic growth and it keeps getting better and better relative to the market, right. So, the spread of 2, 3 points better than that, that's not in question, right, so at 4% to 6%, you get to the 7% to 9%. When I think about my 20-plus years in this industry, thinking about what the historical growth is, what the drivers are for the growth, I feel 4% to 6% long-term market growth is actually the appropriate number that the things that the industry are going through now do not change my view that the long-term health of this industry is exceptionally bright and that you will see that return. And I can't call when exactly that returns, but what I can say is that the unmet healthcare needs and all the drivers that we talked about at our Analyst Day remain extraordinarily bright for the future. So thank you, Jack. Yeah. So I've been out with customers. As you know, I do that a lot. I've been out on a definitely out there with our customer tour, both in Europe and the US, and earlier in the quarter, I was in China. So when I think about what our customers are saying, they are actually very bullish on the mid to long term, right? So there's quite a lot of opportunities for us. What I would say is short term, if you're visiting a smaller biotech customer, what you're seeing is concerns about when the funding environment is going to improve. So there's a level of caution. And I think that's generally across the customer base as customers are being cautious after a very robust pandemic period. But long term and the excitement and customers looking forward to the future with us, it's extremely positive. Anything on the non-term interest rate? Yeah. So, Dan, thanks for the question. I think the way that Stephen and I thought about giving an early view to 2024 is not based on us having finished our operating plan process which we do in December, and then when we actually lay out guidance, we do it based on how did the year finish, all of the details by business, by geography and then we figure out the details. We took the benefit of each of us having 20-plus years of experience in the industry, looking at the market conditions that we see today, and basically went through the assumptions of how could 2024 play out based on what we know today, right? So this is not a bottoms-up view by country, by geography and by business unit, but rather based on experience and based on what we're seeing. So when I think about for us next year, all right, we try to give you incredible clarity about what's COVID in our numbers, right? So we're expecting a run-off of $1.3 billion of COVID-related revenue in 2024, that would leave $300 million of revenue in 2024, of which we have a pretty good line-of-sight to what those activity is, right? So that's the first assumption. And then the second assumption is effectively what's going on in the base business, meaning, excluding the COVID-related business, and that should be a little bit over 3% growth, right? So if you think of those two factors, that's how you get to a core number of one. Remember that testing is part of the decline. So that's the set of assumptions. So then there is another lens to think about it, which is comparisons, right, or the -- we're going to lap the customer caution, different businesses at different points in time, but the first half will have more difficult comparisons, haven't fully seen the effect of caution. The second half, you actually get to more --you're back to kind of moderate growth in that period of time just based on that factor. And then we look at some of our businesses like our insurance business, which had the benefit this year of the disruptions from supply-chain in 2021 and 2022, and we're able to catch-up on orders that needed to be shipped and that gave us a little bit of a benefit of growth this year, of which, that obviously doesn't repeat next year. We factored all that in and we said, core is pretty similar to what it is next year. We look forward to actually doing the detailed guidance at the end of January, early February when we have our earnings call, and we'll have all of our puts and takes and be a lot smarter. But we wanted our analyst community to be aligned with what we're seeing today because there's quite a big disconnect in the numbers that are out there for 2024 relative to the numbers that we articulated today. Thanks, Dan. Dan, I think your fellow analysts are throwing tomatoes at your building today. You're asking 19 questions in that one, but I'll start at a high level and leave some of this for others. Let me break the pharma -- biopharma into what revenue was in Q3 and then a little bit of -- some of the underlying dynamics. Actually, the revenue in the quarter was incredibly similar to the prior quarter, right, in terms of how we actually performed. We declined 1%. And looking at that, the long-term outlook here is strong. We talked about that in an earlier question. Effectively, customer caution increased a bit. You'll see that more pronounced in biotech and pharma, but you see it across the customer set. That's more of a forward-looking look. I think the thing that probably is most relevant and why we think about our fourth quarter the way we do, one of the things that we assumed in our previous guidance was that in our bioprocessing business, that orders would stabilize, start to normalize in the third quarter. We did not see that, right? Obviously, what's the single biggest driver of the same factors in Q4 versus what we talked about really is bioproduction. We didn't see that normalization of orders. In general, that business operates on a roughly 13-week lead time. So if you don't see the orders in Q3, you're not going to see the revenue step-up in Q4. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of framing. I'm sure I'll get some of the other ones in future questions. Yeah. So they're great questions. So let's talk about clinical research one level above and then I'll give you some of the answers to the question you have. All right. So we are almost at the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of PPD, which closed in early December of 2021. Business is doing great, right, and it's been a terrific acquisition. It is a terrific acquisition with a bright future. If you think about what the moment-in-time was in December of 2021, PPD had done a great job of growing its core sort of normal business and played a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for vaccines and therapies, just a phenomenally relevant set of capabilities, which is part of the reason we knew how great the business was and how respected it was in the industry. Since our ownership, we've modeled in that this would be a declining portion of the business. It's actually been a headwind through all of our ownership on core organic growth, right? So if I think about -- so our core organic would actually been higher than if we didn't include it. But our view was, this business' end-market growth was really good and we're just going to grow through it and it was factored into our guidance. Obviously, as customer caution has increased in pharmaceutical and biotech, the rates of growth in our non-COVID business slows. And we wanted to ensure that our investors understood that that was actually quite healthy, but we're going through the run-off on vaccines and therapies. To give you the magnitude of the number, what is embedded in our 2023 is a $600 million decline in revenue for vaccines and therapies, and it also happens to be $600 million of activity in the year. So that's this year, and as opposed to sort of take or pay or those things, clinical trials are different, but you have patients enrolled, you go through it. So that revenue will run off in an orderly fashion over the next couple of years in the outlook that we gave of $300 million of total revenue for all pandemic related. Some of that -- most of it is actually that work in clinical research. There's a little bit of take or pay in pharma services and nominal amount of testing. So hopefully that gives you a good sense of the dynamic there. Yeah. So obviously, we'll get into some of that. We don't even do it by business unit in our guidance. So -- but I can give you sort of direction how to think about it. What we have said at the time of the acquisition and what we've said consistently is the long-term growth expectation for this business is high-single-digits plus the benefit of synergies. And that hasn't changed in terms of the long term. Our assumption has been that it would step down from the 20% and then sort of double-digit growth to that, and then actually it will step down below that and bounce back up just on the math of the COVID -- the COVID activity run-off over the next year or so. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how to think about modeling it. Thanks, Derik. So, Rachel, thanks. Let me start with China. And I think it's really relevant for the community to understand our view on what's going on in China, right? So first of all, it was great to return to China, which I did in August. And actually came away with -- and way more encouraged on the long term. So let me give you a little bit more detail on it. I went to China with two different hats. One is the Chair of the US-China Business Council, where I had the opportunity to interact with senior members of the Chinese government, including the premier. And then I also did my normal thing of being CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific and had the opportunity to see our colleagues, visit sites and see a lot of customers during that process. So this is what I came away with from my visit. Economy is definitely challenged, and the conditions are worsening, and we saw that worsening during the quarter. The government is actively working to boost business confidence and create a stronger environment for foreign investment. So when I think about the kind of the macro picture, short-term, definitely a challenge from a macro-economy. I was pleasantly surprised that a real focus on a better environment for foreign companies, which bodes well for the future. When I think about the outlook here, we definitely saw the impact of the declining economy in the results and we would expect that that will continue. And we can't predict exactly when the market will do. But we know that the comparisons get easier in the second half for China as we lap some of the comparables -- or the more challenging comparables. When I think about phasing for the year and all of all of that stuff, we look forward to doing that in beginning of 2024. So I'll probably keep it at a pretty high level. Awesome quarter in Analytical Instruments, 8% growth. Team is doing a good job. Our electron microscopy business, really performing extremely well. And great to see the uptake on Astral, which is our breakthrough mass spectrometer, which we launched in June. So those are the highlights. Our guidance for this year and our framing for next year reflects the customer caution and the non-repeat of some of the -- working through the disruptions of the pandemic on supply chain. So that's embedded in the outlook for the year. Yeah. So Puneet, thanks for the question. And, so when I think about the M&A for this year or M&A even in general, the criteria that we use, right, is M&A that's going to be highly valued by our customers, strengthen our strategic position, generate strong returns for our shareholders. And you look at what the different opportunities are and you think about it in different periods of time where it's going to skew in your favor. And this year, with a more volatile macro, we've been able to add three phenomenal businesses, right, in terms of strengthening the company with incredible growth prospects, really good return profiles. So that doesn't mean that next year will look exactly like this or years where you can buy companies that are really more of a balance of cost and revenue growth in those different things and different aspects of it. But this year, to be able to get the Binding Site, CorEvitas and Olink, it's fantastic. And when I think about Olink, which, this is our first opportunity given that we had announced it during a blackout period, it's just a terrific fit, right, and you think about it's a leader in a business that has gone through that phase of being well adopted, right? So the technology risk isn't here anymore. But it hasn't globally commercialized. It hasn't reached nearly its full potential and incredibly complementary to our leading position in mass spectrometry and proteomics. And Puneet, thanks for reminding others about our 15-year plus track record with Orbitrap. Astral being the next big many year run and the combination there, plus Olink, and the fact that we have a leading position in the life sciences instrumentation, which are very relevant in terms of qPCR for these products as well. Really exciting. They are a leader in their field and we're excited to help bring that to the customer base in an accelerated fashion. And when we look to the future, we expect this to be a long-term, mid-teens-plus growth business and be able to generate really significant adjusted operating income synergies driven by that accelerated revenue growth, right? And on top of that, just $125 million of earnings that come from the year five synergies, and that's going to generate double-digit returns for the shareholders. So super exciting time, and we'll continue to be outstanding stewards of our shareholders' capital. Thanks. So good question. When I think about the -- it's primarily a bioproduction story. And I don't think anyone is smart enough to know exactly which quarter. But during 2024, do I think that we will get back to orders matching revenue at some point during the year? Yeah. So I think that we'll be smarter with the benefit of another three months of time to see what our view is on 2024. But I don't think we'll be talking throughout the year about inventory reduction in the customer side because there's activity that's going on currently that's consuming the inventory that's out there. Great. So let me bring to just a quick wrap up for the call. Thank you for joining us today. We're very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you in the new year."

My name is Ellen, and I'll be coordinating the call for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce our moderator to the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may now begin the call.\nRafael Tejada: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com under the heading News & Events until August 11th, 2023. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2023 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter, then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing playing out in the macro economy and the implications for our outlook. In the second quarter, our revenue was $10.69 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $5.15 per share. As you saw in our press release, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the quarter. Economic activity in China slowed and across the economy more broadly, businesses became more cautious in their spend. This impacted our Q2 results and informed a more moderated view for the full-year. We're taking appropriate actions to successfully navigate these conditions. As a reminder, when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, we assumed core market growth would be in the normal range of 4% to 6% for 2023. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment at this point, we think it is best to assume that these conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and our current assumption is that core market growth will be in the 0% to 2% range this year. We're increasing our commercial intensity to help our customers through this environment and capture even more opportunities. We're also leveraging the PPI Business System to appropriately manage our costs. Given these changes, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full-year. I'll cover some of the key points around the guidance, and Stephen will outline our underlying assumptions later in the call. For 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44.0 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $22.28 to $22.72. As you know, during periods of change, we have a very clear set of guiding principles on how we manage the company. These principles have three elements. First, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance all while capitalizing on dynamic times to enhance our long-term competitive position, creating an even brighter future for our company. To enable the differentiated short and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI Business System to deliver $450 million of additional cost actions in 2023. That's in addition to what was embedded in our previous guidance. We're ramping up our commercial intensity to drive our share gain momentum, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We're uniquely positioned to help them navigate their own challenges in this environment. When I think about our proven ability to navigate market dynamics, combined with the long-term market growth drivers for the Life Sciences industry, I'm incredibly confident for the future. As I look ahead, there is a clear need for new medicines, and the scientific advances in Life Sciences are leading to exciting and innovative therapies, which will make a profound positive impact on well-being and be one of the drivers creating the very strong and durable tailwind in our industry. Let me now turn to our quarterly performance and provide you with an update on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth was flat for the second quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue run-off performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a 5 point headwind within this market. From a segment perspective that revenue run-off is essentially all in our Life Science Solutions segment, largely in our biosciences business related to nucleotides and enzymes and to a lesser extent in bioproduction. The strongest growth in pharma and biotech end market this quarter was in our pharma services and clinical research businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The strongest growth in this end market was in our analytical instruments businesses. And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue in Q2 was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter driven by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses. Let me now turn to our growth strategy. We really made terrific progress in Q2 in this regard. Our growth strategy consists of three pillars: high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar innovation. We had a really spectacular quarter. We launched high impact new products that are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. We had a great showing at the American Society for mass spectrometry conference, where we featured the groundbreaking Thermo Fish -- Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, which is the most significant advancement in mass spectrometry 15-years. The Orbitrap Astral combines speed, high sensitivity, and deep proteome coverage to enable researchers to uncover proteins that previously evaded detection. This will enable breakthroughs that could lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a range of diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. We've already started to deliver the Astral to our customers and we're very pleased with the strong bookings performance to-date. In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6, scanning transmission electron microscope. The latest innovation in our leading line of instruments designed for the semiconductor industry. This fully automated system enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to accelerate development. In our biosciences business, we introduced the Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit. It accelerates development of novel cancer therapies. These kits support the culture of tumor cells derived from individual patients providing a better disease model for research and drug development that could potentially improve clinical trial success and help bring drug candidates to market faster and more cost effectively. And in specialty diagnostics, we launched the first and only immunoassay to help doctors stratify a mother's risk of developing preeclampsia, a serious complication that can develop in pregnancy in the postpartum period, endangering both mother and baby. We receive breakthrough designation and FDA clearance for assessing a patient's risk of developing severe preeclampsia enabling doctors to better manage care. These are just a few examples of the exciting innovation going on across our company, which will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth. The second pillar of our growth strategy is the trusted partner status that we have built with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry leading products, services, and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. For example, in our Pharma Services business, we added an early development hub at our site in Bourgoin, France enabling early development in addition to commercial manufacturing. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unparalleled commercial engine. We have a meaningful commercial advantage, due to the deep engagement that we're able to have with our customers across the globe. A great example of our progress here is further strengthening our commercial capabilities with the opening of a state-of the-art customer center of excellence in Milan. It features a customer application development lab to showcase our industry leading products, services, and expertise. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition of MarqMetrix, a developer of Ramen based spectroscopy solutions for in line process analytics. This technology expands our capabilities to help our customers make precise and accurate measurements throughout their manufacturing processes in a wide range of applications including biopharma. This business is a nice complement to our analytical instruments business. Let me give you a quick update on the binding site acquisitions, which we closed at the beginning of the year. Our protein diagnostics business has delivered outstanding growth and the integration is going incredibly well. Our team is progressing the innovation pipeline to advance the diagnosis and management of patients both multiple myeloma and immune disorders. And just after the close of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. Real world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in a post approval setting. CorEvitas will further strengthen our capabilities to serve our pharma and biotech customers. It's an excellent strategic fit for our company and highly complementary to our clinical research business. There is strong market demand for real world evidence, which improves decision making and reduces the time and cost associated with drug development. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and I'm very excited about what this will mean for our customers and the patients they serve. Financially, we expect the business to deliver low-double-digit growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.03 in 2024. So overall strong progress in the second quarter for capital deployment. During the quarter, we advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities including launching a partnership with Pfizer to increase local access to next generation sequencing based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. These are areas where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering healthcare providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient. Through the partnership, we will work with local labs using our NGS technology to ensure they meet industry standards for NGS testing for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will work to enable affordable patient access and to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced NGS testing. Together, we'll continue to evaluate additional geographic opportunities and to expand testing for other types of cancer. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a better -- a great work environment for our colleagues and then making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging, our team continues to leverage our PPI business system to deliver strong productivity. We're focused on driving market share gains, and at the same time, we're advancing our proven growth strategy to be the even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. And the attractive long-term outlook for the Life Sciences industry and Thermo Fisher is unchanged. We're incredibly well positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities, and exit this period, an even stronger industry leader with the very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just lines, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the second quarter. We're leveraging our PPI Business System to effectively manage these conditions. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included just over 2% core organic revenue growth and we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was $300 million lower than we'd incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance. $280 million of this was related to the core business and $20 million related to testing. Approximately one-third of the change in core revenue was driven by lower economic activity in China and the remainder was driven by more cautious spending across our customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 lower than when incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, $0.07 of this was driven by FX and $0.21 by the lower revenue. Given the lower core revenue both in the quarter and assumed in our full-year outlook, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. In Q2, this enable us to offset $75 million of the profit impact of the lower-than-expected revenue, this highlights that we're actively managing the business. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS in Q2, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.51. On the top line, reported revenue was 3% points lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was just over 2 percentage points. For context, core organic revenue growth includes the runoff in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue. Without that runoff impact, growth would have been 5% in the quarter. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America declined mid-single-digits. Europe grew in the low-single-digits and Asia Pacific declined in the mid-single-digits with China declining in the low-teens. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, a 150 basis points lower than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and achieved strong price realization, this was more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. Given the change in the macro environment, we're using the PPI Business System to drive significantly more productivity this year than initially planned. We've initiated $450 million of additional cost actions. And as I mentioned earlier, we already began to see this benefit in Q2. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41%, 220 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6 of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q2 last year. Total R&D expense was $345 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest was $148 million, which is $36 million higher than Q2 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, this was 300 basis points lower than Q2 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q2, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $730 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes and returned $135 million of capital through dividends. Shortly after the quarter end, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire core EBITDA for approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and $34 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.9%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 25%, and organic revenue was also 25% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter and to a lesser extent, the macro factors that I described earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science solutions decreased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 33.2%, down 710 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2 and organic growth was 10%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter by the electron microscopy business. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume and mix, that was partially offset by strategic investments and FX. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2 revenue increased 1% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the Core led by our microbiology immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. This is offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which is a 460 basis points higher than Q2 2022. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and favorable business mix, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. And finally, in laboratory products and biopharma services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 5% and organic growth was also 5%. During Q2, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services and Clinical Research Businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1% which is 160 basis points higher than Q2 2022. We delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect both the more challenging macroeconomic environment and the offsetting actions that we're taking to navigate these conditions. Revenue for 2023 is now expected to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44 billion with Core organic revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $22.28 and $22.72. For modeling purposes, our current estimate of where we're likely to end up for the year within that range is $43.5 billion of revenue rounding up to 3% Core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $22.36. Let me provide you some additional details behind the changing guidance. Starting with revenue. Our revised guidance reflects the change in the assumption for Core organic revenue growth from 7% to a range of 2% to 4%. And it also assumes a $100 million lower testing revenue. Our Core organic revenue change is driven by two factors: a reduction in the assumed level of economic activity in China and an assumption that the more cautious spending that we saw across our customer base in Q2 will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In relation to China, at the beginning of the year, we saw positive momentum in the Chinese economy. We had previously assumed that this momentum would continue through the rest of the year. However, as the second quarter progressed, economic activity in China significantly slowed, resulting in less customer activity in the quarter. We think this is appropriate to assume this condition remains in place for the remainder of the year. With regards to customer spending patterns more broadly, in Q2 customers in our end markets began the year with somewhat cautious spending. And this is something that was not confined to our end markets, companies across most business segments were cautious with their spending given the uncertain macro conditions. This dynamic became more challenging in Q2. We previously assumed that this would lessen an impact as the year progressed, and we now think it's appropriate to assume that the cautious spending will continue through the remainder of the year. With strong commercial execution from our team, we expect to successfully navigate these macro dynamics and deliver 2% to 4% Core organic revenue growth for the year. And for context, as Marc mentioned, with the changes in the macro, we're now assuming Core market growth for our industry to be in the range of 0% to 2% for 2023, through reduction of approximately 4 percentage points versus the 4% to 6% assumed previously for market growth. When I think about the range of outcomes for the full-year, Core organic revenue growth, the largest swing factor is the extent of the budget flush at the end of the year. Should that be weaker than normal, then Core organic revenue growth would round down to 2%, and if stronger, it could round up to 4% for the year. And if China gets traction stimulating the economy, then that could also be an upside late in the year. So moving on now to profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. We put in place $450 million of additional cost actions to limit the impact of the expected lower revenue on the P&L. This demonstrates our active management of the business. As a result, the high profitability pull through on the lower revenue is expected to be reduced to 35% in terms of how it flows through to the bottom line. Factoring in this and the updated view of FX, we now expect our adjusted operating income margin to be in the range 23.2% to 23.4% for the year. Let me provide some more additional details on the updated 2023 guidance. We're assuming that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. This is $100 million lower than our prior guidance and through the half-year point we've delivered $225 million of testing revenue. Within the call, we continue to expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3 percentage point impact on core organic revenue growth. Through the half year point, we delivered $365 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. Moving on to FX, we continue to assume that FX will be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And then in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11, which is $0.05 higher than our previous guidance. The Binding Site acquisition is performing well and we now assume it will contribute approximately $260 million to our reported revenue growth for the year and $0.09 to adjusted EPS. Below the line, we continue to expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year has improved to 10% versus our prior guidance of 10.8%, driven by our tax planning initiatives. We're now expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect the free cash flow will be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares and that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. We've not included any operational benefit in 2023 for the acquisition of CorEvitas. When we get more clarity on the actual close date for that acquisition, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2023. To conclude, we recognize that the changing guidance is significant. We think it's appropriate given the change in the macro environment. And as we said at our Investor Day, should market growth be lower than normal? We will leverage the PPI Business System and step up productivity and that's what we've done. We're well positioned to navigate the near-term environment. And while the near-term environment may be more challenging, the long-term fundamentals supporting the growth of our end markets remains unchanged, as does the strength of our position to serve them. Now let me turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now enter the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just starting on the guidance, just given the significant change relative to what you talked about at the Investor Day a few months ago. Could you maybe help us a little bit with where some of the biggest deltas in terms of your expectations relative to that time of the Investor Day and today, in terms of either end market or revenue segment, and specifically within China, were there certain categories or revenue segments or end markets where the weakness is more pronounced? I just kind of wanted to get a little more color the delta and expectations from the Investor Day to today?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Matt, thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance change, the way that I think about let's start from the beginning of the year. I think it's the easiest place to start and we can talk about the Investor Day, right? So, you know, in terms of the market growth and the conditions there, right? Or what we're seeing is that China really slowed quite meaningfully in Q2, right? And that's actually somewhat surprising given the first quarter really started to rebound off of the zero COVID policies and there was government stimulus and all of a sudden Q2 really slowed down significantly and, you know, when I think about that. And then we're assuming that for the full-year, right, in terms that it's going to continue. We've seen customer caution, I mean, I think every business, when I say this is about life science tools and diagnostics. Businesses have been cautious this year on spend and it certainly manifested itself more meaningfully in Q2, particularly in biotech. And so when I think about it, about a point of our change in the growth outlook comes from China, about 3 points of it comes from customer caution. And within it, bioproduction is about a point or a third of the customer caution, passed back two-thirds across the rest of the business. You know, versus sort of what the analyst day and sort of, you know, the view in May, you know, we saw China certainly soft throughout the quarter. And in our business, the final month of a quarter is actually quite meaningful across all of our businesses. So while we certainly saw some customer caution in the beginning of the second quarter, June saw no bounce at all, right? So it just, you know, it's kind of flat through the -- you know, kind of flat through the quarter. So therefore, we just didn't see that view, which is why we've adjusted the outlook at this point in time.\nMatt Sykes: Great. That's very helpful color. Thanks, Marc. And then just for my follow-up, just on the AI segment and instruments, could you maybe just given the visibility you might have into sort of the back half this year, talk about sort of what the backlog looks like order growth and how you're feeling about sort of the moderation in instrument growth in the back half of this year that you talked about earlier this year?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. So when I think about instruments, we obviously entered the year with a strong backlog and we entered the quarter with a strong backlog. And the 10% growth is very strong performance. Orders were definitely softer than we expected in Q2 primarily driven by China, which is a large component of the business there. And therefore, I would say we would expect that the growth rate would become more muted as the year unfolds in the analytical instruments business as we continue to work down the backlog. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Sykes: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Arias: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Stephen, on the PPI commentary and just being able to leverage that, can you expand on that a little bit? I mean, should we take that to mean just sort of pressing harder on being lean in areas where you've done that in the past? Or is that more pulling some levers that have it been fully pulled, so to speak? And then relatedly, the -- you know, the EPS guide only came in about 5% or so at the midpoint. So how do we think about mix as a factor there and how much room do you think that's left to you given the uncertainty that you're looking in the back half?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So, Dan, I'll explain on the PPI side and then I'll get onto the, kind of, EPS for you. So it's on PPI that what we do it's how we run the company. So this is about the first thing you do when you think about economic conditions being different and activity levels being different with our customers is prioritization in terms of what we're working on and deprioritize areas, which may be less important, push things out as appropriately and then make sure that we're investing in the right areas that we should be investing in and not titrating back any spending where that really matters. So it's about prioritizing where we're spending our time and what we're working on. And part of that Dan is then reduction in discretionary spending, reduction in activity levels in certain areas. And use PPI to be able to help us do that and put that into operation. We use the company scale in terms of the levers and sourcing, particularly in in-directs. You can lean on those levers when economic conditions aren't too strong and that's definitely a way of getting some of the benefits. And then when we think about the expected slightly lower volumes and we're optimizing our manufacturing operations appropriately and generally across our businesses. We're appropriately reducing headcount where that makes sense across the business. And so all of that wraps up into $450 million of benefit this year. And those actions have pretty much all been actioned right now in terms of the -- there's nothing significant to come. It's more they've taken the appropriate actions given the environment that we see. Then in terms of the back half of the year, so was your question around the phasing of EPS or the range of EPS, could you just clarify?\nDan Arias: I guess it was a little bit of both. I mean, organic growth is going from high-singles to potentially low-singles and the EPS only actually came in pretty modest amount. So I was just wondering how much room you think you've given yourself, given your PPI comments whether, you know, you are -- I guess, the answer is you're comfortable with it, but how comfortable actually are you given the range of outcomes in the back half?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So we provided a range of outcomes and what you thought about what the market conditions could be and when we think about what the pull through would be on the revenue and that range of outcomes, plus the activities we're working on the cost side. I think that's an appropriate range for EPS. And then the phasing first-half, second-half, clearly, a higher adjusted operating income margin in the second-half of the year and that's really largely driven by the impact of the cost actions. So of the $450 million, $75 million impacted the first-half and you'll have $375 million of benefit in the second-half. And then revenue is a little bit more weighted and look at the year as a whole to the second-half versus the first-half. That's the other piece that drives the profitability in EPS difference. Thanks, Dan.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. Okay, helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Marc, maybe one on -- you know, thanks for all the color on the assumptions are on the guide change, when you look at the quarter, maybe can you talk about how things progress? I think China was down low-teens. Overall, organic -- underlying organic was 2%. But things worsened throughout the quarter. Because I think the implied guidance for the back half is low-singles to 2%-ish at the midpoint. So we're just wondering if the exit rate was around 2%-ish? Or is the back half assuming some improvement from the exit rate levels of 2Q?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Vijay, in terms of the phasing of the quarter, I think really what was -- different was June saw none of the normal quarter-end pattern. So it was very similar to April and May. That -- in my many years of doing this, that's unusual, actually, where the last month isn't a big step-up in activity. That's just the sort of the pattern of the industry a bit. So our assumption for the year is effectively that the market conditions that we saw in Q2 -- in aggregate, for Q2 continues to play out for the balance of the year. And you have all sorts of different comparisons within the different businesses versus the prior year and so forth. But we felt that the 0% to 2% market growth and for us, for the full-year, the 2% to 4% core growth would be an appropriate performance. I think maybe the best color that I can give you is sort of how we think about it, right? Our best view on what happened in the market is informed by looking at all of the competitors, peers that reported in Q1. Obviously, that goes well into May. All of our internal data about what's going on in the market, our extensive dialogue with customers and the few companies that reported so far, right? So that informs the 0% to 2%. The way we think about this and the standard is -- it's our job to gain market share. We put in 2 points of growth faster than that assumption. We're going to hold ourselves to that standard, meaning if we're too conservative on the market outlook, then we will have higher expectations of what good looks like in terms of the year, but that's our best view. When you look at the script and the comments that Stephen and I made, we made no comments about share gain in Q2, because when you deliver 2% growth, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. At least looking at the first few companies that have reported, it appears that our performance is actually quite good and that we're growing faster. There's a lot of companies yet to report, but it actually looks like on a relative basis, we actually had a solid quarter of growth. So hopefully, that gives you some context of where things are, but we're going to keep studying it and make sure we got a good handle on our performance. And when we end \u201823, that we will be proud that we navigated the environment extremely well, deliver differentiated performance and set the company up for long-term success.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful color, Marc. And maybe one follow-up here. The updated guidance, is it assuming China to remain decline for the rest of the year? And what was PPI's growth in the quarter?\nStephen Williamson: So Vijay, the decline will lessen on a reported basis because of the run-up in testing factor therapy is a little bit there in terms of the support of the pandemic that we did in the back half of the year last year. So we're assuming basically the same market conditions, not just China, but for the rest of the world, as well as we saw in Q2 for the remainder of the year.\nMarc Casper: Clinical research, double-digit growth. Thank you, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\nMarc Casper: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks, guys. Marc, Jets are hoping out and Rogers can navigate through a difficult schedule, certainly hope and expect you'll navigate Thermo through these more difficult macro times here. Maybe just the first one, would love to get more color on China. Could you just walk us through just more color across your major customer segments, kind of unpack, kind of how the quarter played out from that perspective? And then specifically, I would also love to hear color on bioproduction in China.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So in terms of China, when I think about it, we had a decline on an organic basis a little over 10%. Core was about flat in terms of it, and I'm just trying to give some flavor. So you, obviously, have the COVID testing. What we saw in China -- and it was very different than what our team expected, what we expected. And if I think about that, that's an unusual comment coming from us. Actually, our leadership team from China came to the U.S. and the opportunity to sit down and chat with what are they seeing? So -- and I'm heading over to China in a few weeks as well for a week. So it's an important market. It really does feel like it is broad economic based. And -- so we saw that across our different businesses, not limited to one. Clearly, bioproduction was soft in China. So consistent with some of the other comments that you've heard from others. But we saw the slowdown really cut across the portfolio, if you will, and it seems to be economic activity. We always assume, hey, are we doing something wrong? Are we losing share? All of those things, because I think that's sort of the PPI discipline, which is fact-based, hold yourself accountable to a high standard, at least on what we're seeing, it just feels like customers got extraordinarily cautious in China, activity slowed and it showed up across the portfolio. And while I haven't had a moment to distract myself on some fun activities, I look forward to, at some point, some football and seeing if the Jets actually make an improvement.\nStephen Williamson: Dan, I can't comment on the Jets. But when I think about China, it is way broader than life science tools. This is a Chinese economy. They're clearly having problems getting that economy back up and running post-COVID. And they have a history of being able to do that. So -- but we're not counting on that for the remainder of the year as a way to frame it from a wider economic viewpoint. Thanks, Dan.\nDan Brennan: And then maybe just on the end market, 4% to 6%, which you took down to 0% to 2% right now under your planning for 2023, kind of from what you see today? Is that 0% to 2% the best starting point as we think about modeling out Thermo's top line for 2024?\nMarc Casper: Do you want to talk a little bit about, Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So just broadly on 2024, when I think about what you need to do to model the company going forward, there's two factors. One is the jumping off point for the 2023 margins and then what's the macro conditions assumption you used for 2024. So obviously, on the macro, we're assuming that the near-term conditions stay the same throughout the remainder of the year. You will need to make your own assumption around what that market growth is for next year. We'll have more clarity on that when we get towards the end of this year and know what the macro conditions are like. So it's not macro within our industry, it's the macro in terms of the overall economic situation across the globe. So we'll have a clearer view on that towards the end of this year. As Marc said earlier, we'll hold ourselves to the standard of delivering a couple of points higher than what the market growth is when we think about that. So as you leave in what assumption you have, I think the assumption is we'll be driving a couple of points of share gain above that. And then from a margin standpoint, a normal assumption for the year, we start with 50 basis points of expansion on top of what we just ended the year. And then when you think about my guide for this year, will be some small benefit of the carryover of the cost actions into 2023 as well. So that will help you think about the margin profile for \u201824 at this point and provide you a more refined view on that when we give the guidance for \u201824 in more detail. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, thank you and good morning. So Dan sort of asked so the question I wanted to talk to you about on \u201824. I guess, Marc, what's your view that we're not entering a more prolonged downturn in the life sciences tools market? And I'm just sort of thinking about this from a historical perspective when we've, sort of, seen some resets in the market, and it's taken a while for this to sort of like wash through the system. So it's like what's your confidence that we're not in a situation where we've got a couple -- we've got a period where the growth is going to be sort of back in that lower range?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Derik, it's a great question. So if I step back from the crystal ball for the which moment and say, what's the drivers here. This is an unbelievable industry with incredible tailwinds. And even since the Analyst Day, if you look about the progress on approved medicines that are going on and the cycle that, that creates of more funding to fuel the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. It's extraordinarily encouraging for the long term, right? So when I think about 4% to 6% market growth for the long term, as bullish as ever, right, in terms of that. When I think about the dynamics, most of what is going on is around the macroeconomic environment, not the life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, right, in terms of caution in the economy, credit availability, all of that cycle higher interest rates and, therefore, less funding going into higher growth business, all of that dynamic is a macro within our own industry, you clearly have the pandemic unwind, right, that's shaking out. And as you look at the industry's numbers, and even if you look at our numbers, the pandemic-related activity will be relatively modest this year. So most of that will have washed out in the industry this year. So when I think about \u201824, as Stephen said, it's really going to be what's the macro, not the life sciences tools macro, that I think is the big driver. Because the science can be explosive. Great things going on in pharma biotech. There'll be great new discoveries. All of that will attract funding. It's just a question of, is this a kind of a stabilization year for the economy and then it balances? That's the bull case. Or is this a more prolonged period? And then that obviously is more of the bearish case on sort of what the macro is. While we won't have a perfect crystal ball as we get into our guidance in '24, we'll have a much better sense of what the conditions are we are navigating. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nDerik De Bruin: Yes, it is. It is. So just a follow-up on this is, like how much of the pharma and biotech slowdown is just this digestion of the excess COVID spending? And clearly, there was frothy biotech markets and people worry about supply chain. So there was -- a lot of money that went into the system as people did this? How much is this just digesting that extra spend versus -- are you seeing new concerns? Are these customers seeing new concerns of a regulatory environment, drug pricing, patent expirations? Are you seeing any signs of slowing clinical trial activity or higher cancellations rates? Just some sort of thought on what's just a hangover period from COVID versus new trepidation in the space?\nMarc Casper: Sure. So Derik, the way I would think about it is, if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of how we talked about our guidance, pharma and biotech, right, as a company, as a reminder, our core organic growth was 14% in 2022. Within that, vaccines and therapies were essentially flat. So actually, the -- whatever the stripping that out, we actually grew faster than that. Pharma Biotech, incredibly strong in 2022. Our view was, while the market would be a good end market in 2023, but given the comparisons, it would moderate meaningfully. That's not a negative comment, it's just such an oversized growth and our very strong growth in the prior year period, we knew that growth would slow. And when you look at the Q2 results, you're flat and 5 points of headwind, which actually performed literally exactly as we had forecasted for the quarter. So kind of 5% growth, excluding the sort of vaccine and therapy runoff this year. That gives you a sense of what the sort of base activity is in that market, which actually is reasonable. It's slower than some other periods. But given the comparison, it actually is a reasonable view. In terms of the color and all of those things, pharma's doing fine, right, I mean in terms of what's happening there. And it's really biotech, every quarter that funding has been a little bit more challenged or not as strong as the past, companies get more conservative, because they think about what's their runway on spending, and that really picked up in terms of the headwinds in Q2 against an incredibly difficult comparison in the prior year period. The final point I would make here is that there are some green shoots starting to happen in biotech, right? In terms of new company formation, some of the funding, actually, Q2 started to show some signs of positivity. That, obviously, takes a while to flow through the numbers. But actually, that's an encouraging data point as well. Hopefully, that level of context gives you some of how to think about it.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. Thanks, Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Derik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question this morning. So I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on that guidance kind of how you guys are bucketing where the cut was really coming from. So you said that of the 400 basis points, 1 point was really from China, 3 points were around customer spending, with one of that coming from bioproduction. So can you just give us a bit more color on where the remaining 2 points a weaker customer spend is happening? It sounds like PPD growth was strong. So where else are you seeing weakness in the portfolio? And then also from an end market perspective, is this really all just weakness in pharma biotech or is there some additional weakness in industrial, for example?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So when I think about customer caution, sort of, a macroeconomic view, you see that across all types of customers. So it's not limited to one segment. It's more pronounced than biotech, but we saw it in some industrial customers and certainly, we saw in some of the other customers that we serve, academic and government so forth. So it's not limited to one view. In terms of the growth where the impact and the change of growth is in the other segments, clearly, with -- our view is that the instruments business will slow in the second-half of the year. So that's probably one of the changes. And then some of the run rate activity that you would see in things like bioscience reagents or customer channels, which actually -- those are great businesses. We think customers will be a little bit more muted in spending. So it's really not pin to one area, but just a spread across the portfolio, probably with instruments feeling most of the impact.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we're ready for -- we'll take one last question.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about M&A. These dynamic times, historically, have a way of creating new opportunities. There's been a few larger assets talked about in the press. Just would love to get your thoughts. Do you expect to be active if something materialized?\nMarc Casper: Yes. Jack, thanks for the question. So in terms of capital deployment and M&A, we've been active on return of capital, both through the increase in the dividend and the share buybacks earlier in the year. We've also been active on M&A, with closing the Binding Site to start the year. We're excited about CorEvitas. And we have a lot of firepower, and we're very active, right? I do agree with your sentiment that, in these periods, there are opportunities. So we're actively looking at a number of things. And we're only going to do transactions that fit our criteria, which is, ultimately, going to strengthen our offering from a customer perspective. It's going to clearly add shareholder value in terms of the returns that we generate from the transaction. So you'll see us be active. And whether that happens in terms of the second half of the year or into \u201824, we're certainly busy is the way I would think about it.\nJack Meehan: Great. And I have one follow-up on Pharma Services. It sounds like that business grew faster than PPD this quarter. Can you talk about how the demand profile is holding up there? And I need to ask about the Tornado that hit Rocky Mount. Does that have any material impact on the market as you see it?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Pharma Services, really strong performance, in terms of growth and the way you'd characterize it as accurate. So very strong growth in that business. When I think about new wins and some of the things that we're securing for the future, the team is doing a nice job of building out a strong backlog for the future. So that business is in a good spot. When I think about the Tornado that hit in North Carolina, the good news is that nobody was injured at least in our discussions with the customer and they're assessing the issues from a market perspective. And we stand ready to help our customers as we do in any situation, and we never view that as a business opportunity. We always view it as we have very material relationships with our customers. And our colleagues are there to support them, and we will support in any way that is helpful as they work through the natural disaster. So thank you, Jack, for the question. And thanks, everyone, for the questions today. Let me wrap up with -- thanks for joining us. We're very well positioned to deliver and continue to deliver differentiated performance, which we'll do.

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just lines, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the second quarter. We're leveraging our PPI Business System to effectively manage these conditions. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included just over 2% core organic revenue growth and we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was $300 million lower than we'd incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance. $280 million of this was related to the core business and $20 million related to testing. Approximately one-third of the change in core revenue was driven by lower economic activity in China and the remainder was driven by more cautious spending across our customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 lower than when incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, $0.07 of this was driven by FX and $0.21 by the lower revenue. Given the lower core revenue both in the quarter and assumed in our full-year outlook, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. In Q2, this enable us to offset $75 million of the profit impact of the lower-than-expected revenue, this highlights that we're actively managing the business. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS in Q2, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.51. On the top line, reported revenue was 3% points lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was just over 2 percentage points. For context, core organic revenue growth includes the runoff in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue. Without that runoff impact, growth would have been 5% in the quarter. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America declined mid-single-digits. Europe grew in the low-single-digits and Asia Pacific declined in the mid-single-digits with China declining in the low-teens. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, a 150 basis points lower than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and achieved strong price realization, this was more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. Given the change in the macro environment, we're using the PPI Business System to drive significantly more productivity this year than initially planned. We've initiated $450 million of additional cost actions. And as I mentioned earlier, we already began to see this benefit in Q2. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41%, 220 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6 of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q2 last year. Total R&D expense was $345 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest was $148 million, which is $36 million higher than Q2 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, this was 300 basis points lower than Q2 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q2, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $730 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes and returned $135 million of capital through dividends. Shortly after the quarter end, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire core EBITDA for approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and $34 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.9%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 25%, and organic revenue was also 25% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter and to a lesser extent, the macro factors that I described earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science solutions decreased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 33.2%, down 710 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2 and organic growth was 10%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter by the electron microscopy business. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume and mix, that was partially offset by strategic investments and FX. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2 revenue increased 1% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the Core led by our microbiology immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. This is offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which is a 460 basis points higher than Q2 2022. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and favorable business mix, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. And finally, in laboratory products and biopharma services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 5% and organic growth was also 5%. During Q2, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services and Clinical Research Businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1% which is 160 basis points higher than Q2 2022. We delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect both the more challenging macroeconomic environment and the offsetting actions that we're taking to navigate these conditions. Revenue for 2023 is now expected to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44 billion with Core organic revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $22.28 and $22.72. For modeling purposes, our current estimate of where we're likely to end up for the year within that range is $43.5 billion of revenue rounding up to 3% Core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $22.36. Let me provide you some additional details behind the changing guidance. Starting with revenue. Our revised guidance reflects the change in the assumption for Core organic revenue growth from 7% to a range of 2% to 4%. And it also assumes a $100 million lower testing revenue. Our Core organic revenue change is driven by two factors: a reduction in the assumed level of economic activity in China and an assumption that the more cautious spending that we saw across our customer base in Q2 will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In relation to China, at the beginning of the year, we saw positive momentum in the Chinese economy. We had previously assumed that this momentum would continue through the rest of the year. However, as the second quarter progressed, economic activity in China significantly slowed, resulting in less customer activity in the quarter. We think this is appropriate to assume this condition remains in place for the remainder of the year. With regards to customer spending patterns more broadly, in Q2 customers in our end markets began the year with somewhat cautious spending. And this is something that was not confined to our end markets, companies across most business segments were cautious with their spending given the uncertain macro conditions. This dynamic became more challenging in Q2. We previously assumed that this would lessen an impact as the year progressed, and we now think it's appropriate to assume that the cautious spending will continue through the remainder of the year. With strong commercial execution from our team, we expect to successfully navigate these macro dynamics and deliver 2% to 4% Core organic revenue growth for the year. And for context, as Marc mentioned, with the changes in the macro, we're now assuming Core market growth for our industry to be in the range of 0% to 2% for 2023, through reduction of approximately 4 percentage points versus the 4% to 6% assumed previously for market growth. When I think about the range of outcomes for the full-year, Core organic revenue growth, the largest swing factor is the extent of the budget flush at the end of the year. Should that be weaker than normal, then Core organic revenue growth would round down to 2%, and if stronger, it could round up to 4% for the year. And if China gets traction stimulating the economy, then that could also be an upside late in the year. So moving on now to profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. We put in place $450 million of additional cost actions to limit the impact of the expected lower revenue on the P&L. This demonstrates our active management of the business. As a result, the high profitability pull through on the lower revenue is expected to be reduced to 35% in terms of how it flows through to the bottom line. Factoring in this and the updated view of FX, we now expect our adjusted operating income margin to be in the range 23.2% to 23.4% for the year. Let me provide some more additional details on the updated 2023 guidance. We're assuming that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. This is $100 million lower than our prior guidance and through the half-year point we've delivered $225 million of testing revenue. Within the call, we continue to expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3 percentage point impact on core organic revenue growth. Through the half year point, we delivered $365 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. Moving on to FX, we continue to assume that FX will be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And then in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11, which is $0.05 higher than our previous guidance. The Binding Site acquisition is performing well and we now assume it will contribute approximately $260 million to our reported revenue growth for the year and $0.09 to adjusted EPS. Below the line, we continue to expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year has improved to 10% versus our prior guidance of 10.8%, driven by our tax planning initiatives. We're now expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect the free cash flow will be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares and that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. We've not included any operational benefit in 2023 for the acquisition of CorEvitas. When we get more clarity on the actual close date for that acquisition, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2023. To conclude, we recognize that the changing guidance is significant. We think it's appropriate given the change in the macro environment. And as we said at our Investor Day, should market growth be lower than normal? We will leverage the PPI Business System and step up productivity and that's what we've done. We're well positioned to navigate the near-term environment. And while the near-term environment may be more challenging, the long-term fundamentals supporting the growth of our end markets remains unchanged, as does the strength of our position to serve them. Now let me turn the call back over to Raf. Yes. So, Dan, I'll explain on the PPI side and then I'll get onto the, kind of, EPS for you. So it's on PPI that what we do it's how we run the company. So this is about the first thing you do when you think about economic conditions being different and activity levels being different with our customers is prioritization in terms of what we're working on and deprioritize areas, which may be less important, push things out as appropriately and then make sure that we're investing in the right areas that we should be investing in and not titrating back any spending where that really matters. So it's about prioritizing where we're spending our time and what we're working on. And part of that Dan is then reduction in discretionary spending, reduction in activity levels in certain areas. And use PPI to be able to help us do that and put that into operation. We use the company scale in terms of the levers and sourcing, particularly in in-directs. You can lean on those levers when economic conditions aren't too strong and that's definitely a way of getting some of the benefits. And then when we think about the expected slightly lower volumes and we're optimizing our manufacturing operations appropriately and generally across our businesses. We're appropriately reducing headcount where that makes sense across the business. And so all of that wraps up into $450 million of benefit this year. And those actions have pretty much all been actioned right now in terms of the -- there's nothing significant to come. It's more they've taken the appropriate actions given the environment that we see. Then in terms of the back half of the year, so was your question around the phasing of EPS or the range of EPS, could you just clarify? Yes. So we provided a range of outcomes and what you thought about what the market conditions could be and when we think about what the pull through would be on the revenue and that range of outcomes, plus the activities we're working on the cost side. I think that's an appropriate range for EPS. And then the phasing first-half, second-half, clearly, a higher adjusted operating income margin in the second-half of the year and that's really largely driven by the impact of the cost actions. So of the $450 million, $75 million impacted the first-half and you'll have $375 million of benefit in the second-half. And then revenue is a little bit more weighted and look at the year as a whole to the second-half versus the first-half. That's the other piece that drives the profitability in EPS difference. Thanks, Dan. Yes. Okay, helpful. So Vijay, the decline will lessen on a reported basis because of the run-up in testing factor therapy is a little bit there in terms of the support of the pandemic that we did in the back half of the year last year. So we're assuming basically the same market conditions, not just China, but for the rest of the world, as well as we saw in Q2 for the remainder of the year. Dan, I can't comment on the Jets. But when I think about China, it is way broader than life science tools. This is a Chinese economy. They're clearly having problems getting that economy back up and running post-COVID. And they have a history of being able to do that. So -- but we're not counting on that for the remainder of the year as a way to frame it from a wider economic viewpoint. Thanks, Dan. Yes. So just broadly on 2024, when I think about what you need to do to model the company going forward, there's two factors. One is the jumping off point for the 2023 margins and then what's the macro conditions assumption you used for 2024. So obviously, on the macro, we're assuming that the near-term conditions stay the same throughout the remainder of the year. You will need to make your own assumption around what that market growth is for next year. We'll have more clarity on that when we get towards the end of this year and know what the macro conditions are like. So it's not macro within our industry, it's the macro in terms of the overall economic situation across the globe. So we'll have a clearer view on that towards the end of this year. As Marc said earlier, we'll hold ourselves to the standard of delivering a couple of points higher than what the market growth is when we think about that. So as you leave in what assumption you have, I think the assumption is we'll be driving a couple of points of share gain above that. And then from a margin standpoint, a normal assumption for the year, we start with 50 basis points of expansion on top of what we just ended the year. And then when you think about my guide for this year, will be some small benefit of the carryover of the cost actions into 2023 as well. So that will help you think about the margin profile for \u201824 at this point and provide you a more refined view on that when we give the guidance for \u201824 in more detail. Thanks, Dan."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter, then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing playing out in the macro economy and the implications for our outlook. In the second quarter, our revenue was $10.69 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $5.15 per share. As you saw in our press release, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the quarter. Economic activity in China slowed and across the economy more broadly, businesses became more cautious in their spend. This impacted our Q2 results and informed a more moderated view for the full-year. We're taking appropriate actions to successfully navigate these conditions. As a reminder, when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, we assumed core market growth would be in the normal range of 4% to 6% for 2023. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment at this point, we think it is best to assume that these conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and our current assumption is that core market growth will be in the 0% to 2% range this year. We're increasing our commercial intensity to help our customers through this environment and capture even more opportunities. We're also leveraging the PPI Business System to appropriately manage our costs. Given these changes, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full-year. I'll cover some of the key points around the guidance, and Stephen will outline our underlying assumptions later in the call. For 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44.0 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $22.28 to $22.72. As you know, during periods of change, we have a very clear set of guiding principles on how we manage the company. These principles have three elements. First, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance all while capitalizing on dynamic times to enhance our long-term competitive position, creating an even brighter future for our company. To enable the differentiated short and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI Business System to deliver $450 million of additional cost actions in 2023. That's in addition to what was embedded in our previous guidance. We're ramping up our commercial intensity to drive our share gain momentum, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We're uniquely positioned to help them navigate their own challenges in this environment. When I think about our proven ability to navigate market dynamics, combined with the long-term market growth drivers for the Life Sciences industry, I'm incredibly confident for the future. As I look ahead, there is a clear need for new medicines, and the scientific advances in Life Sciences are leading to exciting and innovative therapies, which will make a profound positive impact on well-being and be one of the drivers creating the very strong and durable tailwind in our industry. Let me now turn to our quarterly performance and provide you with an update on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth was flat for the second quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue run-off performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a 5 point headwind within this market. From a segment perspective that revenue run-off is essentially all in our Life Science Solutions segment, largely in our biosciences business related to nucleotides and enzymes and to a lesser extent in bioproduction. The strongest growth in pharma and biotech end market this quarter was in our pharma services and clinical research businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The strongest growth in this end market was in our analytical instruments businesses. And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue in Q2 was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter driven by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses. Let me now turn to our growth strategy. We really made terrific progress in Q2 in this regard. Our growth strategy consists of three pillars: high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar innovation. We had a really spectacular quarter. We launched high impact new products that are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. We had a great showing at the American Society for mass spectrometry conference, where we featured the groundbreaking Thermo Fish -- Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, which is the most significant advancement in mass spectrometry 15-years. The Orbitrap Astral combines speed, high sensitivity, and deep proteome coverage to enable researchers to uncover proteins that previously evaded detection. This will enable breakthroughs that could lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a range of diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. We've already started to deliver the Astral to our customers and we're very pleased with the strong bookings performance to-date. In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6, scanning transmission electron microscope. The latest innovation in our leading line of instruments designed for the semiconductor industry. This fully automated system enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to accelerate development. In our biosciences business, we introduced the Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit. It accelerates development of novel cancer therapies. These kits support the culture of tumor cells derived from individual patients providing a better disease model for research and drug development that could potentially improve clinical trial success and help bring drug candidates to market faster and more cost effectively. And in specialty diagnostics, we launched the first and only immunoassay to help doctors stratify a mother's risk of developing preeclampsia, a serious complication that can develop in pregnancy in the postpartum period, endangering both mother and baby. We receive breakthrough designation and FDA clearance for assessing a patient's risk of developing severe preeclampsia enabling doctors to better manage care. These are just a few examples of the exciting innovation going on across our company, which will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth. The second pillar of our growth strategy is the trusted partner status that we have built with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry leading products, services, and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. For example, in our Pharma Services business, we added an early development hub at our site in Bourgoin, France enabling early development in addition to commercial manufacturing. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unparalleled commercial engine. We have a meaningful commercial advantage, due to the deep engagement that we're able to have with our customers across the globe. A great example of our progress here is further strengthening our commercial capabilities with the opening of a state-of the-art customer center of excellence in Milan. It features a customer application development lab to showcase our industry leading products, services, and expertise. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition of MarqMetrix, a developer of Ramen based spectroscopy solutions for in line process analytics. This technology expands our capabilities to help our customers make precise and accurate measurements throughout their manufacturing processes in a wide range of applications including biopharma. This business is a nice complement to our analytical instruments business. Let me give you a quick update on the binding site acquisitions, which we closed at the beginning of the year. Our protein diagnostics business has delivered outstanding growth and the integration is going incredibly well. Our team is progressing the innovation pipeline to advance the diagnosis and management of patients both multiple myeloma and immune disorders. And just after the close of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. Real world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in a post approval setting. CorEvitas will further strengthen our capabilities to serve our pharma and biotech customers. It's an excellent strategic fit for our company and highly complementary to our clinical research business. There is strong market demand for real world evidence, which improves decision making and reduces the time and cost associated with drug development. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and I'm very excited about what this will mean for our customers and the patients they serve. Financially, we expect the business to deliver low-double-digit growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.03 in 2024. So overall strong progress in the second quarter for capital deployment. During the quarter, we advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities including launching a partnership with Pfizer to increase local access to next generation sequencing based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. These are areas where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering healthcare providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient. Through the partnership, we will work with local labs using our NGS technology to ensure they meet industry standards for NGS testing for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will work to enable affordable patient access and to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced NGS testing. Together, we'll continue to evaluate additional geographic opportunities and to expand testing for other types of cancer. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a better -- a great work environment for our colleagues and then making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging, our team continues to leverage our PPI business system to deliver strong productivity. We're focused on driving market share gains, and at the same time, we're advancing our proven growth strategy to be the even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. And the attractive long-term outlook for the Life Sciences industry and Thermo Fisher is unchanged. We're incredibly well positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities, and exit this period, an even stronger industry leader with the very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes. So Matt, thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance change, the way that I think about let's start from the beginning of the year. I think it's the easiest place to start and we can talk about the Investor Day, right? So, you know, in terms of the market growth and the conditions there, right? Or what we're seeing is that China really slowed quite meaningfully in Q2, right? And that's actually somewhat surprising given the first quarter really started to rebound off of the zero COVID policies and there was government stimulus and all of a sudden Q2 really slowed down significantly and, you know, when I think about that. And then we're assuming that for the full-year, right, in terms that it's going to continue. We've seen customer caution, I mean, I think every business, when I say this is about life science tools and diagnostics. Businesses have been cautious this year on spend and it certainly manifested itself more meaningfully in Q2, particularly in biotech. And so when I think about it, about a point of our change in the growth outlook comes from China, about 3 points of it comes from customer caution. And within it, bioproduction is about a point or a third of the customer caution, passed back two-thirds across the rest of the business. You know, versus sort of what the analyst day and sort of, you know, the view in May, you know, we saw China certainly soft throughout the quarter. And in our business, the final month of a quarter is actually quite meaningful across all of our businesses. So while we certainly saw some customer caution in the beginning of the second quarter, June saw no bounce at all, right? So it just, you know, it's kind of flat through the -- you know, kind of flat through the quarter. So therefore, we just didn't see that view, which is why we've adjusted the outlook at this point in time. Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. So when I think about instruments, we obviously entered the year with a strong backlog and we entered the quarter with a strong backlog. And the 10% growth is very strong performance. Orders were definitely softer than we expected in Q2 primarily driven by China, which is a large component of the business there. And therefore, I would say we would expect that the growth rate would become more muted as the year unfolds in the analytical instruments business as we continue to work down the backlog. Thank you, Matt. Yes. So Vijay, in terms of the phasing of the quarter, I think really what was -- different was June saw none of the normal quarter-end pattern. So it was very similar to April and May. That -- in my many years of doing this, that's unusual, actually, where the last month isn't a big step-up in activity. That's just the sort of the pattern of the industry a bit. So our assumption for the year is effectively that the market conditions that we saw in Q2 -- in aggregate, for Q2 continues to play out for the balance of the year. And you have all sorts of different comparisons within the different businesses versus the prior year and so forth. But we felt that the 0% to 2% market growth and for us, for the full-year, the 2% to 4% core growth would be an appropriate performance. I think maybe the best color that I can give you is sort of how we think about it, right? Our best view on what happened in the market is informed by looking at all of the competitors, peers that reported in Q1. Obviously, that goes well into May. All of our internal data about what's going on in the market, our extensive dialogue with customers and the few companies that reported so far, right? So that informs the 0% to 2%. The way we think about this and the standard is -- it's our job to gain market share. We put in 2 points of growth faster than that assumption. We're going to hold ourselves to that standard, meaning if we're too conservative on the market outlook, then we will have higher expectations of what good looks like in terms of the year, but that's our best view. When you look at the script and the comments that Stephen and I made, we made no comments about share gain in Q2, because when you deliver 2% growth, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. At least looking at the first few companies that have reported, it appears that our performance is actually quite good and that we're growing faster. There's a lot of companies yet to report, but it actually looks like on a relative basis, we actually had a solid quarter of growth. So hopefully, that gives you some context of where things are, but we're going to keep studying it and make sure we got a good handle on our performance. And when we end \u201823, that we will be proud that we navigated the environment extremely well, deliver differentiated performance and set the company up for long-term success. Clinical research, double-digit growth. Thank you, Vijay. Thanks. Yes. So in terms of China, when I think about it, we had a decline on an organic basis a little over 10%. Core was about flat in terms of it, and I'm just trying to give some flavor. So you, obviously, have the COVID testing. What we saw in China -- and it was very different than what our team expected, what we expected. And if I think about that, that's an unusual comment coming from us. Actually, our leadership team from China came to the U.S. and the opportunity to sit down and chat with what are they seeing? So -- and I'm heading over to China in a few weeks as well for a week. So it's an important market. It really does feel like it is broad economic based. And -- so we saw that across our different businesses, not limited to one. Clearly, bioproduction was soft in China. So consistent with some of the other comments that you've heard from others. But we saw the slowdown really cut across the portfolio, if you will, and it seems to be economic activity. We always assume, hey, are we doing something wrong? Are we losing share? All of those things, because I think that's sort of the PPI discipline, which is fact-based, hold yourself accountable to a high standard, at least on what we're seeing, it just feels like customers got extraordinarily cautious in China, activity slowed and it showed up across the portfolio. And while I haven't had a moment to distract myself on some fun activities, I look forward to, at some point, some football and seeing if the Jets actually make an improvement. Do you want to talk a little bit about, Stephen? Yes. So Derik, it's a great question. So if I step back from the crystal ball for the which moment and say, what's the drivers here. This is an unbelievable industry with incredible tailwinds. And even since the Analyst Day, if you look about the progress on approved medicines that are going on and the cycle that, that creates of more funding to fuel the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. It's extraordinarily encouraging for the long term, right? So when I think about 4% to 6% market growth for the long term, as bullish as ever, right, in terms of that. When I think about the dynamics, most of what is going on is around the macroeconomic environment, not the life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, right, in terms of caution in the economy, credit availability, all of that cycle higher interest rates and, therefore, less funding going into higher growth business, all of that dynamic is a macro within our own industry, you clearly have the pandemic unwind, right, that's shaking out. And as you look at the industry's numbers, and even if you look at our numbers, the pandemic-related activity will be relatively modest this year. So most of that will have washed out in the industry this year. So when I think about \u201824, as Stephen said, it's really going to be what's the macro, not the life sciences tools macro, that I think is the big driver. Because the science can be explosive. Great things going on in pharma biotech. There'll be great new discoveries. All of that will attract funding. It's just a question of, is this a kind of a stabilization year for the economy and then it balances? That's the bull case. Or is this a more prolonged period? And then that obviously is more of the bearish case on sort of what the macro is. While we won't have a perfect crystal ball as we get into our guidance in '24, we'll have a much better sense of what the conditions are we are navigating. Hopefully, that's helpful. Sure. So Derik, the way I would think about it is, if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of how we talked about our guidance, pharma and biotech, right, as a company, as a reminder, our core organic growth was 14% in 2022. Within that, vaccines and therapies were essentially flat. So actually, the -- whatever the stripping that out, we actually grew faster than that. Pharma Biotech, incredibly strong in 2022. Our view was, while the market would be a good end market in 2023, but given the comparisons, it would moderate meaningfully. That's not a negative comment, it's just such an oversized growth and our very strong growth in the prior year period, we knew that growth would slow. And when you look at the Q2 results, you're flat and 5 points of headwind, which actually performed literally exactly as we had forecasted for the quarter. So kind of 5% growth, excluding the sort of vaccine and therapy runoff this year. That gives you a sense of what the sort of base activity is in that market, which actually is reasonable. It's slower than some other periods. But given the comparison, it actually is a reasonable view. In terms of the color and all of those things, pharma's doing fine, right, I mean in terms of what's happening there. And it's really biotech, every quarter that funding has been a little bit more challenged or not as strong as the past, companies get more conservative, because they think about what's their runway on spending, and that really picked up in terms of the headwinds in Q2 against an incredibly difficult comparison in the prior year period. The final point I would make here is that there are some green shoots starting to happen in biotech, right? In terms of new company formation, some of the funding, actually, Q2 started to show some signs of positivity. That, obviously, takes a while to flow through the numbers. But actually, that's an encouraging data point as well. Hopefully, that level of context gives you some of how to think about it. Thanks, Derik. Yes. So when I think about customer caution, sort of, a macroeconomic view, you see that across all types of customers. So it's not limited to one segment. It's more pronounced than biotech, but we saw it in some industrial customers and certainly, we saw in some of the other customers that we serve, academic and government so forth. So it's not limited to one view. In terms of the growth where the impact and the change of growth is in the other segments, clearly, with -- our view is that the instruments business will slow in the second-half of the year. So that's probably one of the changes. And then some of the run rate activity that you would see in things like bioscience reagents or customer channels, which actually -- those are great businesses. We think customers will be a little bit more muted in spending. So it's really not pin to one area, but just a spread across the portfolio, probably with instruments feeling most of the impact. Yes. Jack, thanks for the question. So in terms of capital deployment and M&A, we've been active on return of capital, both through the increase in the dividend and the share buybacks earlier in the year. We've also been active on M&A, with closing the Binding Site to start the year. We're excited about CorEvitas. And we have a lot of firepower, and we're very active, right? I do agree with your sentiment that, in these periods, there are opportunities. So we're actively looking at a number of things. And we're only going to do transactions that fit our criteria, which is, ultimately, going to strengthen our offering from a customer perspective. It's going to clearly add shareholder value in terms of the returns that we generate from the transaction. So you'll see us be active. And whether that happens in terms of the second half of the year or into \u201824, we're certainly busy is the way I would think about it. Yes. So Pharma Services, really strong performance, in terms of growth and the way you'd characterize it as accurate. So very strong growth in that business. When I think about new wins and some of the things that we're securing for the future, the team is doing a nice job of building out a strong backlog for the future. So that business is in a good spot. When I think about the Tornado that hit in North Carolina, the good news is that nobody was injured at least in our discussions with the customer and they're assessing the issues from a market perspective. And we stand ready to help our customers as we do in any situation, and we never view that as a business opportunity. We always view it as we have very material relationships with our customers. And our colleagues are there to support them, and we will support in any way that is helpful as they work through the natural disaster. So thank you, Jack, for the question. And thanks, everyone, for the questions today. Let me wrap up with -- thanks for joining us. We're very well positioned to deliver and continue to deliver differentiated performance, which we'll do. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Thanks, everyone."

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of very strong financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. I'm pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our company, especially within the context of a slightly more challenging macro environment. Our continued success is the result of our proven growth strategy that trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.71 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.33 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.03 per share. At the beginning of the year, we set out appropriately ambitious guidance for 2023 and Q1 demonstrates that we're delivering against that. Let me turn to our end markets. We delivered very strong performance in Q1, driven by outstanding execution from our team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Pandemic related activity performed as we had expected during the quarter. As a reminder, the impact of the headwind from the revenue runoff can be seen in pharma and biotech due to vaccines and therapies and in diagnostics and healthcare due to COVID-19 testing. Let me give you some color on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered growth in the mid-single digits for the quarter. During the quarter, we had very strong performance in our pharma services, clinical research and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single digits in the quarter. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including chromatography, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, as well as the research and safety market channel. Academic and government demand were strong in all regions. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high-single digits for the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses, including electron microscopy, chemical analysis and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q1, revenue was approximately 45% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses. I'll now turn to our proven growth strategy, which enables us to continue to deliver differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our growth strategy consists of three pillars developing high impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, innovation. We had an excellent start to the year as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses during the first quarter. These technologies are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In elemental analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ Plus ICP-MS Analyzer. This ICP mass spectrometry system simplifies analysis of trace elements in complicated samples, including the identification of heavy metals in soil and water as well as toxic elements in food and beverage. In Genetic Sciences, we launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q AutoRun dPCR Suite, an automated digital PCR solution to increase productivity for molecular research, including cell and gene therapy and cancer research. In our Biosciences business, we launched the Invitrogen DynaGreen, microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification. This new product will help our customers to reduce the environmental impact of life science research and builds on our long history of innovation and market leadership in bioscience reagents. And in our Clinical Diagnostics business, we launched the Thermo Scientific DRI Tramadol assay, which broadens our extensive toxicology portfolio with a new drug of abuse assay to help fight the opioid crisis. These are just a few examples of the innovation going on across our company, and I'm excited about the robust pipeline of products that will be launched throughout the year. We also recently learned that Thermo Fisher was ranked number 22 on Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. This is a new award launched in 2023 based on product and process innovation and a company's culture. A really nice recognition of our team and their track record. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets by opening a new Gibco cell culture rapid prototyping facility at our existing site in Suzhou, China. This facility will help regional customers accelerate the transition of their cell culture media production into current good manufacturing practices. It will also ensure patients receive therapies manufactured to the highest level of safety, effectiveness, quality and purity. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I've had the opportunity to meet with dozens of our pharmaceutical and biotech customers since the beginning of the year, and our value proposition is clearly resonating. Our trusted partner status gives us an early understanding of customers unmet needs and the ability to generate insights that allow for deep collaborations that continue to advance scientific breakthroughs. During Q1, we achieved an exciting milestone in our strategic partnership with the University of California, San Francisco with the opening of a new cell therapy cGMP Manufacturing and Collaboration Center to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies for glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers. In this facility, we offer UCSF and other customer solutions for cell therapy development, from discovery to clinical research through to commercial manufacturing. Partnerships like this have the potential to transform clinical care. Another example of our customer value proposition and the trusted partner status that we have established with our pharma and biotech customers can be seen in the excellent performance of our clinical research business, which drove very strong growth in the quarter. I'm very excited by the revenue synergies that will drive both short-term and longer term growth in the business. The momentum is continuing to build and is benefiting both our clinical research business and other parts of the company. We're also working with very engaged customers on longer term projects to explore ways to reduce the time and cost of bringing drugs to market. By bringing our capabilities and expertise within our pharma services and clinical research businesses together, we are working to improve the effectiveness of the drug development process, benefiting both our customers and their patients. We have an exciting pilot underway that is utilizing dedicated resources and best-in-class technologies and capabilities to provide enhanced visibility and real-time data to the customer. This improves the speed of decision making and reduces potential delays from development to manufacturing to clinical trials. It can also help our customers take cost out of the process by reducing waste in the clinical supply process. This is really a nice example of why we are the trusted partner. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day, and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and the customer experience, while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. You can see the positive impact of our PPI Business System and our results in Q1. It is also allowed us to capitalize on the strong demand from customers for analytical instrumentation and has also helped us to effectively address the runoff and pandemic related activity and appropriately manage our costs. Moving to capital deployment. We've had an active start to the year both in strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We closed the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. It's great to have this business now as part of the company. The business is a fantastic fit with our Specialty Diagnostics business and we're leveraging our capabilities to take an excellent business and make it even better. The integration is going very smoothly and the business is performing very well, tracking ahead of plan. Our team is focused on advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders, and the innovation pipeline looks great. We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care in this area. In terms of return of capital, during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of stock and increased our dividend by 17%. So, overall, a great start to the year from capital deployment. During the quarter, we also advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities, including securing agreements to power all current US sites with 100% renewable energy by 2026. This is a significant contribution to our 2030 commitment to a 50% of reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. As we continue to transition away from fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy, we're also accelerating our progress towards our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We'll be releasing our latest Corporate Social Responsibility report later this quarter and will give our stakeholders a really substantive view on our continuous improvement and the positive impact that we're having. Let me now turn to our guidance. Since the beginning of the year, the macro environment has become slightly more challenging. We're stepping up to that challenge and our proven growth strategy, powered by our PPI Business System, is enabling us to maintain our ambitious full year outlook with revenues of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.70. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our very strong results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well. Our unique customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status and we're continuing to gain market share. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and shareholders, and we're incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance and an excellent 2023 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with a very strong Q1. Our growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is enabling us to continue to very effectively navigate the company through a dynamic macro environment, manage the runoff in pandemic related revenue and drive excellent core organic revenue growth and share gains. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included 6% core organic revenue growth. We delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS. Our core organic revenue growth was 1% higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, and adjusted EPS was $0.02 ahead. So a very strong start to the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. So beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS in Q1. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.32. On the top line reported revenue was 9% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 8% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Pandemic related revenue came in as we expected in Q1. This is comprised of $140 million of testing revenue and $180 million of vaccines and therapies revenue. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6%. And as a reminder, core organic revenue growth continues to include the change in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue, which was a headwind of approximately 3% in the quarter. So very strong core performance showing the continued strength of our business. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America declined high-single digits. Europe declined in the low-double digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low-single digits, with China declining slightly and Rest of World declined high-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 32% and adjusted operating margin was 21.8%, 740 basis points lower than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This was more than offset by lower pandemic related revenue and continued strategic investments. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 40.3%, 720 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.3% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $350 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 6.9% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $154 million, which is $36 million higher than Q1 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This is 410 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q1, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $730 million. Free cash flow for Q1 was $280 million after investing $450 million in net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $5.8 billion of capital. This included $2.7 billion for the acquisition of The Binding Site and $3.1 billion of capital to return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that were generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details starting with Life Science Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in the segment declined 38% and organic revenue was 37% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 62% and adjusted operating margin was 32%, down 19 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher pandemic related revenue in Q1 2022. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q1 and organic growth was 17%. The strong growth was broad based in the segment this quarter led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and the electron microscopy businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 40% and adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, strong productivity and favourable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue declined 25% and organic revenue was 28% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 21% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, which is 140 basis points higher than Q1 2022. During the quarter, we delivered favourable business mix and strong productivity, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volumes. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. Q1 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 7%. During Q1, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, which is 240 basis points higher than Q1 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're maintaining our guidance for full year 2023, consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion, including 7% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. There's no net change overall in our guidance, but how we expect to achieve this guidance is different from the way we planned at the start of the year, and it demonstrates our ability to effectively navigate the dynamic macro environment and maintain a very strong financial outlook. Since our initial guide, we see $0.25 of additional headwinds to adjusted EPS, $0.15 from business mix and $0.10 from FX. We're actively offsetting all of this headwind about $0.20 through cost management and $0.05 through actions below the line. So no net change overall. The PPI Business System is enabling us to navigate the company very effectively through a dynamic macro environment. As I mentioned, the 2023 guidance reflects a very strong financial outlook. Let me remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We continue to assume 7% core organic revenue growth from market growth of 4% to 6%. Within that core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3% impact on core organic revenue growth. It's worth noting that the majority of our vaccine and therapy revenue in 2023 is expected to be in our pharma services business. With regards to testing revenue, we continue to assume $400 million for 2023. We're assuming The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth this year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. We continue to assume that net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. Our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares. And we're assuming we return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So turning now to the assumptions that have changed. As I mentioned earlier, our FX assumption for the year has changed. We still expect FX to be a tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million or 0.2%. However, we now expect it to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.06. That's $0.10 more of a headwind than the previous guidance due to changes in rates and the expected mix of our currencies. Guidance assumes adjusted operating margins for 2023 to be in the range of 23.8% to 23.9% for the year. The adjusted tax rate assumption has improved slightly from our initial guide. We now expect it to be 10.8% for the full year. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Compared to our initial phasing assumptions, we now expect a slightly higher weighting of revenue and adjusted EPS in the second half of the year. We're currently assuming that the first half of the year represents approximately 48% of our full year revenue dollars and 44% of our full year adjusted EPS dollars. Q2 core organic growth is expected to be mid-single digits, probably best to model at a slightly lower than Q1. To conclude, we delivered a very strong start to the year and we're in great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. So my question is focused on lab products, biopharma services. First is on PPD. So we've been getting some mixed signals so far this earnings around biotech customer demand. Marc, I would love to get your perspective. How did PPD grow this quarter? What does the outlook assume? Has that changed at all? And then can you talk about award trends that you're seeing? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack thanks for the question. Good morning. Our clinical research business, PPD had a very strong start to the year. The growth continues to be in the mid-teens. And it's doing really well. We had strong backlog. We had good level of authorization. So that business is continuing to benefit from the revenue synergies. You've seen that start to come into the numbers this year and I'm very excited about the prospect. Team is doing a really good job of executing. Environment is definitely a little bit more challenging, but the team is doing a good job to go out and capture the business.\nJack Meehan: Great. Okay. And then one more on that segment is just would love to hear your color around how the research channel performed this quarter. Can you just talk about core market demand and any share dynamics that you're seeing? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Our channel business, Fisher Scientific channel has done really well actually consistently for quite a number of years. It plays an amazing role in enabling our customers to do the research that they're doing and make sure they do that in an effective and efficient way. And the business is off to a good start. It has had good growth. And our best sense on share dynamics as it continues to win customers. So it's a well-performing business.\nJack Meehan: Super. Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Jack.\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And so first half, two of your peer have recently talked about visibility within bioprocessing being pressured to more like three to six months of visibility versus historical nine to 12 months. So can you just walk us through what's your current level of visibility? And is that different between customer sets within large pharma versus some of these emerging biotech customers? And then also, how does PPD and having that business impact your level of visibility there?\nMarc Casper: Sure. So, Rachel, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll step up a level first, and then I'll talk about the specifics of the question because as I look and read some of the other industry participants reports so far. Clearly, a noisy quarter in the industry. And when I frame that, as a reminder, when we started the year, we set out ambitious goals for 2023, right? And we do that every year. For us, a 7% core growth from an organic perspective against a 14% comparison and also have very strong earnings. So that's sort of as we came into the year. So what's different in late April versus February 1st when we set out our guidance. Well, the first thing is, we delivered a great chart to the year, right? Great Q1. Second, the macroeconomic environment is more challenging, right? And that leads to a slightly more cautious spend in all sectors of the economy, nothing to do with life science tools and pharma services. But we also see that in some of our customers as well in terms of the caution. Within our own company, a couple of our businesses are performing slightly better than our original guidance, and that's our analytical instruments business which had an excellent Q1 and we now have more visibility into Q3 for that business and that looks encouraging. The second business is doing a little bit better than our original guidance with Specialty Diagnostics is also a strong start. Bioproduction, which is where your question is really focused, we're going to see in the first half more headwinds than our original expectation. It's driven really by the customers are benefiting from the improved lead times that we're delivering against because we brought our -- completed our network expansion, right? So customers can get products more quickly. And our view is this is a temporal phenomenon, and we feel good about what the long-term prospects here. In terms of the specifics in terms of visibility and by customer sets and those things. I think the way that I think about it is, long-term, this is an incredible market with great growth. It's grown very high for many years in the past and has incredible tailwinds. It has a reasonably good visibility because it's related to customer production. And our expectation is that the second half of the year is better than the first half of the year in terms of the view. As a reminder, Rachel, it represents 10% of our revenue. So I think it's important to keep that in the context as well.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just one on instruments. Analytical Instruments grew 17% during the quarter. You flagged that that's one of the areas that's been better than expected so far versus your initial guidance for the year. So can you walk us through what are your latest expectations for Analytical Instrument growth for the year? And then are there any end markets within AI that are just growing faster than expected? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So in terms of our instruments business, we really are benefiting from very strong adoption of our innovation, right? We just continue to bring out great products. As a reminder, during the pandemic, we continue to fuel and accelerate our R&D pipeline, and you're seeing the benefit of it. We are capitalizing on the semiconductor desire to move to the next generation of nodes, which uses our electromicroscopy. We're a key enabler for battery technology with our microscopes and our chromatography and mass spectrometry business doing incredibly well. So the strength here is broad based. Obviously, the 17% growth in the quarter, very strong. We would expect a good level of growth in Q2. And what we had said at the beginning of the year is that, that would moderate in the second half, and we think that moderation will be less than we originally expected in Q3. So we expect it to be a solid Q3, and we'll obviously have more visibility to Q4 when we report in July. So we're assuming that Q3 is little better than we expected and Q4 as we expected at this point because that's what we have visibility to. Thanks, Rachel.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik, your line is open. Please proceed.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi. Good morning. So I'm curious you've talked about ambitious guide and the markets being a little bit tougher. Yes, you're maintaining guidance because you're offsetting some things right now. I guess, is there additional little room to do further offsets if the market curates further there. Basically, it's a question about your confidence in that guide and how much sort of like leeway is built into it? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Derek, the way that we manage the company, right, is the first thing we want to deliver differentiated performance in a given year that we would be proud of delivering and strengthen the company for the long-term, right? And that's the first set of principles. And that set of principles has served us very well for many years. And when you look at our track record, we do a good job of delivering short-term and strength in the long-term. When I think about the outlook for the year and where we are we feel good about the full year guidance at this point in time based on how Q1 has played out and the changes and we've laid out some of the assumptions around that for the balance of the year. And if those assumptions are largely the way the year plays out, we're going to be in a great position. If those assumptions are too conservative, we'll beat these numbers. If those assumptions are too aggressive then we will appropriately adjust guidance over time, right? And I'm not shy about any of those dynamics. We try to give you total transparency and I feel good about our outlook based on Q1 and the assumptions that we're making.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. And going back, I mean, because we're obviously getting a lot of questions on the whole bioprocessing and inventory issues. I know your business is more upstream focused on downstream and it looks like you're maintaining the expectations you have for the COVID vaccine element. But can you just talk a little bit more about some of the dynamics in that space? And why your business is a little bit different than some other ones? And also just you talked about some moderating in bioproduction. Just a little bit more clarity on that. Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yeah, sure. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Just can I level set for a second on the actual revenue for 2023, the $500 million of vaccines and therapies. That's pretty much all in our pharma Services business, it's not in the bioproduction business.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. Okay.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So when I think about the dynamics here, on the COVID vaccine, as Stephen said, my take is, it's played out almost exactly. I mean Q1 is exactly where we anticipated when we look at our visibility to the $500 million, I feel very good about that in terms of it because we know the contracts that we have and what activity has been booked there. So that's pretty straightforward. When I think about the bioproduction more generally, what I would say is in the very practical dynamics to go back to the pandemic, right? Huge demand, right, for these products. Those companies that were successful and unsuccessful and trying to bring out therapies and vaccines for response to the pandemic. That stressed lead times for everybody. Obviously, it varies differently by how much capacity, how well companies are on all those different dynamics, but lead times got super extended, right? For us and the nature of our products, our leadership in cell culture media and single use. Customers don't really order extra. It's not one of these things where you want to be stockpiling this stuff because they're very specific to the campaigns that you're running, right? So the dynamic becomes very simple. If we have a 30-week lead time, which was extended during the pandemic, you order 30 weeks -- with 30 weeks visibility. When we bring that lead time back into normal to say 15 weeks for simplicity, customers will work through what they ordered because they don't have to order as quickly because they know we're going to give them the product, right? And one of the themes that we said throughout the pandemic was we work super closely with our customers like incredible around the dialogue. So they trust that we're going to deliver when we say. So they didn't over order in the time when lead times got extended and they're ordering appropriately now. So can you call that to the month? No, of course, not. But we have a reasonable view that the first half is going to be a little bit softer than we originally had put in our expectations that the second half starts to pick up. And the good news is between instruments, especially diagnostics, it's offsetting at this point. So hopefully that's helpful.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. Thanks.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Marc, while we had to wait for the conference call to get the core organic guide reiteration for Thermo. The Jets went up to you by giving us Aaron Rodgers trade before the draft. Fans have to be excited for the year. I hope you are. So maybe just on bioproduction, a question there. Would you be willing to share with us just some color within the context of your biopharma outlook for 2023. How you're thinking about the growth rates for your consumables business the CDMO and PPD. I know on the last call, you gave us PPD, but just trying to get a breakdown or a sense of the different components for your biopharma outlook for the year?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in the spring, hope springs eternal in football because [indiscernible] hasn't been made yet. But effectively, from my perspective, pharma and biotech is a good question. If you take -- let's focus on the market itself, right? When I think about the quarter, we delivered mid-single digit growth, right? And when you think about what's embedded in that is obviously that's where the vaccine and therapy rolloff is from the prior year. So we did it exactly as we expected. So that basically you have double-digit growth, not a big normalization guys, but just to try to make it simple, if you didn't have a vaccine and therapy rolloff, you'd have double-digit growth in that segment. So most of the change from trajectories around that. I think the second thing to remember is that last year, we grew 14%. This year, we grew -- we're expecting to grow 7%. The expectation, obviously, is therefore our growth, while outstanding is going to be more moderate than last year and given the pharma and biotech is our largest customer segment, obviously, our expectation is that growth will moderate. I would say largely, Q1 was pretty similar to what we thought it would be with bioproduction being a little bit softer. You can say there's a little bit more caution in the smaller biotech customers. But do I think it's like dramatically different? I don't, right? And so we're working through that and we have strength in other parts of our mix. And that's kind of where we are. On all the details of each of the businesses by customer side, they don't really manage that way. And on the bioproduction side, as I said a little bit earlier, in total, it represents about 10% of our revenue.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Thank you for that, Marc. And then maybe as a follow-up on earlier question on instruments. You talked about better visibility. So what is -- you talked a lot about share gains as well. So maybe could you give us a sense of how you're somewhat bucking the trend that the other peers are seeing after a strong couple of years. You're still seeing above corporate average growth, others are kind of citing more comps. So what's driving between FEIC, LC-MS and any geographies or anything you want to share with us about the strength in your AI business for 2023?\nMarc Casper: Yes. The team is doing a good job executing, right? They're doing a good job on navigating the various supply chain things that happened over the last couple of years and our shipments are at a high level we're going out and winning business. I think the strategy that the team has executed around breakthrough innovation. Customers find money when the products are really relevant. I mean that's been my experience. Over long periods of time or if you have great products, customers want them. So that's been a positive dynamic certainly for the instruments business. And what I would say is we definitely have challenging comparisons this year. We're off to a good start. And I would expect that growth will moderate a bit in the second half, but Q3 being a little bit better than we originally expected.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Thank you, Marc.\nMarc Casper: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is open. Please proceed.\nMatthew Sykes: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Marc or Stephen, just first on sort of regional trends. Stephen, you outlined some of the growth in the quarter for Europe and China, but just any incremental color on what you're seeing, particularly in China across your business and how you think that those trends play out over the course of this year?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. China actually played out pretty much as we expected in the quarter, right? So our expectation for Q1 was it was going to be slightly better than Q4 that you'd still see some of the impact of the unwind of the Zero COVID policy. And that as the year progresses, it will continue to strengthen from there. When I look at the first quarter in China, the business was down slightly. The core growth actually was high-single digits in the quarter. So that felt good. What I would say is, we expected stimulus to happen in the first quarter. It did happen in the first quarter. So that played out. It was good to see the Chinese government released money to the academic institutions. You see that in our instrument business. And so that played out well. And so I feel good about the outlook. Obviously, the geopolitical tensions are real, and that's an environment that is going to be around, I would suspect for a while. And we'll navigate through it, but China should be a good market for us this year and it has been historically. Stephen, anything on the --\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Matt, on the other end markets, when I think there's a lot of noise from the pandemic unwind, but when I kind of see through that, good growth really across all of the main geographies. So nothing really to call out there.\nMatthew Sykes: Got it. And then just maybe one high level on PPD. You talked about the growth there. And obviously, it's been outgrowing peers. Can we attribute any of that outsized growth to sort of the value proposition that being a part of Thermo might represent for your customer base? Or is it still too early to kind of see that potential growth impact come in and this is just PPD executing as it has been.\nMarc Casper: I think our team is doing a great job of executing, right? They are out there serving customers and patients so that customers are making a great choice to work with us, right? They're doing a really good job. We clearly have a high level of new authorizations because of the combination of what Thermo Fisher brings and what PPD brought together, right? So there's a lot of customer interest. It shows up in authorization is showing up in our revenue now. That continues to build. And I'm excited. Next year will be year three. And, as a reminder, that's $250 million of revenue that we're assuming from a revenue synergy next year. So it's really exciting in terms of where it is, and I feel good about the performance of the business and the outlook.\nMatthew Sykes: Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Vijay, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the steady front here. Marc, my first question for you, high level. I think your prior guidance for biopharma end market was slightly north of corporate about 7% or thereabouts. Did that change at all, Marc? And if it did change, where is the change coming from between CDMO CRO and bioprocessing in -- could you just remind us what is Thermo's exposure to early-stage biotech emerging pharma?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Vijay, we gave like 80,000 foot directional views on the markets at the end of the -- at the beginning of the year to set the guidance context. And when I think about the additional color that Steve and I have provided today, it really says that it's more business focused, which is actually how we manage our company. Instrument specialty diagnostics a little bit stronger bioproduction a little bit softer primarily in the first half. So that translates probably into a tiny little changes within the end markets, but nothing that really jumps out as something meaningfully different. What I would say is in terms of the early biotech, those are a great customer set that we have done a fantastic job serving. Yesterday, I was actually talking to roughly 400 members of that community at a customer event here in the Greater Boston area. And like the room was buzzing, not because I was speaking, but rather just like me walking in and this is such energy and excitement. So why is that? Because they're bringing through cures that are going to exception an enormous difference. The science is phenomenal. So there's clearly going to be more caution in that segment, depending on the funding environment, but the science is great. The passion is extraordinary. And we are the company that people come to advance the molecule from a scientific idea to an improved medicine. So it's customers that we love, we're going to do well. And we obviously generate the vast majority of our revenue from the large pharma and biotech customers, and they're doing well, and we've got a strong position there. So hopefully that at least gives you the qualitative context of how to think about it.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful perspective, Marc. And Stephen one quick follow-up for you. Second quarter guidance mid-single. I think you said second quarter perhaps below Q1, the comps will get easier for you in 2Q. So maybe just walk us through on the Q2 thought process?\nStephen Williamson: Really, the main piece is just the timing on the bioproduction and instrumentation being stronger in Q3, as Marc outlined in terms of change our guide assumptions.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thanks, guys.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Vijay.\nStephen Williamson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Arias of Stifel. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Arias: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, on the services side, I'm just curious how the Unity business is performing in light of this sort of sustained period of instrument demand that we're seeing here is acceleration something that we can expect there? Or is this more of sort of a steady-state growth rate at this point?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. When I think about our instrument and equipment services business, what that business is, as a reminder for our investors is, we service our fleets of instruments. We also work at pharmaceutical and biotech campuses for our customers to manage their inventory, do those activities, help them with some of the things that they need done to run their labs as well as service other people's equipment and instrumentation. So that's what we do. In general, that is a steady, nicely growing business because we've had very significant growth in the volume of our instruments over the last couple of years that becomes a trailing tailwind for the business because you have a year or so of warranty, so you don't get any additional revenue effectively. But as the warranty rolls off, that does actually drive incremental demand. So your hypothesis there is correct, but that's one that continues to strengthen at this part of the cycle.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. And then, Dan, particularly on the electron microscopy business where customers can't service themselves. So you have some customers that can be efficient service from other kind of lower end instrumentation. But from electromicroscopy standpoint, they're really looking for us to step up and help them with that. So that continued, as Marc said, that continued tailwind is very significant.\nDaniel Arias: Yes. Okay. Helpful. And then, Stephen, while I have you, just on the variables of the equation that have changed slightly underneath an unchanged guide overall, is there anything in terms of the evolving expectations for the business units themselves. Marc may have mention of some things, some businesses that are doing better than others. So I just sort of wanted to sum that up when we think about segment trajectory and just modeling those going forward. Thanks.\nStephen Williamson: Yes. I think we outlined the key changes. I think one thing that's hard for people to model is kind of where the vaccines and therapies changes. When I think about Q1 that was all in the Life Science Solutions segment. That's Biosciences business as well as Bioproduction. So from a year-over-year change, that was, I think, about an eight percentage point impact on the segment. That lessens as a headwind when I think about that going forward, but still most of that change in that revenue stream is in that segment as I think about the year as a whole. But nothing significant changing underneath other than we've already identified in terms of the overall guide.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Of course, our final question of today comes from Puneet Souda of SVB Securities. Puneet, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Hi, Marc. Good morning and congrats here. Just I'll stick to one maybe sort of 1.5 question. Capital deployment, 2022, you did two deals, PeproTech earlier in there and then Binding Site. Wondering how the outlook is looking for capital deployment this year. Maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for what you're seeing from market participants in both public and private markets. And then just briefly on the Inflation Reduction Act. Could you outline what you're hearing from your larger pharma customers? I'm wondering if they're changing how they're allocating their R&D going forward? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So, Puneet, thanks for the questions. In terms of the IRA, I think customers are working through that in terms of what the implications and does that adjust any of the long-term decision making about what our preferred and what's their clinical trial strategy. We haven't seen anything material change at this point? I know there's certainly a lot of dialogue with government. I'm trying to make sure those policies do what they were intended to do. From a capital deployment perspective, this is a good environment from my perspective because you have less competition because of higher interest rates. From certainly private equity and so forth. So I think there's always competition, but I think that's good because that helps you pick and choose and get things at an appropriate valuation. So I think we'll continue to be active. Our pipeline is super busy like so I'm very excited about what we're looking at. You never know how these things actually play out in reality. But there's plenty going on and we'll be aggressive if the right transaction is available to us. So that's the benefit of the company performing well and a great track record of creating value through capital deployment.\nMarc Casper: So thanks for the questions. I think at this point I'll do a quick wrap up. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're very pleased to deliver a strong quarter. We're incredibly well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. I'm looking forward to updating you on our upcoming Investor Day on May 24th. See you in New York City or virtually. And as always thank you for your support at Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with a very strong Q1. Our growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is enabling us to continue to very effectively navigate the company through a dynamic macro environment, manage the runoff in pandemic related revenue and drive excellent core organic revenue growth and share gains. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included 6% core organic revenue growth. We delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS. Our core organic revenue growth was 1% higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, and adjusted EPS was $0.02 ahead. So a very strong start to the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. So beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS in Q1. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.32. On the top line reported revenue was 9% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 8% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Pandemic related revenue came in as we expected in Q1. This is comprised of $140 million of testing revenue and $180 million of vaccines and therapies revenue. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6%. And as a reminder, core organic revenue growth continues to include the change in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue, which was a headwind of approximately 3% in the quarter. So very strong core performance showing the continued strength of our business. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America declined high-single digits. Europe declined in the low-double digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low-single digits, with China declining slightly and Rest of World declined high-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 32% and adjusted operating margin was 21.8%, 740 basis points lower than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This was more than offset by lower pandemic related revenue and continued strategic investments. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 40.3%, 720 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.3% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $350 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 6.9% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $154 million, which is $36 million higher than Q1 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This is 410 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q1, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $730 million. Free cash flow for Q1 was $280 million after investing $450 million in net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $5.8 billion of capital. This included $2.7 billion for the acquisition of The Binding Site and $3.1 billion of capital to return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that were generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details starting with Life Science Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in the segment declined 38% and organic revenue was 37% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 62% and adjusted operating margin was 32%, down 19 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher pandemic related revenue in Q1 2022. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q1 and organic growth was 17%. The strong growth was broad based in the segment this quarter led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and the electron microscopy businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 40% and adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, strong productivity and favourable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue declined 25% and organic revenue was 28% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 21% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, which is 140 basis points higher than Q1 2022. During the quarter, we delivered favourable business mix and strong productivity, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volumes. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. Q1 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 7%. During Q1, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, which is 240 basis points higher than Q1 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're maintaining our guidance for full year 2023, consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion, including 7% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. There's no net change overall in our guidance, but how we expect to achieve this guidance is different from the way we planned at the start of the year, and it demonstrates our ability to effectively navigate the dynamic macro environment and maintain a very strong financial outlook. Since our initial guide, we see $0.25 of additional headwinds to adjusted EPS, $0.15 from business mix and $0.10 from FX. We're actively offsetting all of this headwind about $0.20 through cost management and $0.05 through actions below the line. So no net change overall. The PPI Business System is enabling us to navigate the company very effectively through a dynamic macro environment. As I mentioned, the 2023 guidance reflects a very strong financial outlook. Let me remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We continue to assume 7% core organic revenue growth from market growth of 4% to 6%. Within that core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3% impact on core organic revenue growth. It's worth noting that the majority of our vaccine and therapy revenue in 2023 is expected to be in our pharma services business. With regards to testing revenue, we continue to assume $400 million for 2023. We're assuming The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth this year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. We continue to assume that net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. Our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares. And we're assuming we return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So turning now to the assumptions that have changed. As I mentioned earlier, our FX assumption for the year has changed. We still expect FX to be a tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million or 0.2%. However, we now expect it to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.06. That's $0.10 more of a headwind than the previous guidance due to changes in rates and the expected mix of our currencies. Guidance assumes adjusted operating margins for 2023 to be in the range of 23.8% to 23.9% for the year. The adjusted tax rate assumption has improved slightly from our initial guide. We now expect it to be 10.8% for the full year. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Compared to our initial phasing assumptions, we now expect a slightly higher weighting of revenue and adjusted EPS in the second half of the year. We're currently assuming that the first half of the year represents approximately 48% of our full year revenue dollars and 44% of our full year adjusted EPS dollars. Q2 core organic growth is expected to be mid-single digits, probably best to model at a slightly lower than Q1. To conclude, we delivered a very strong start to the year and we're in great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Thanks, Jack. Just can I level set for a second on the actual revenue for 2023, the $500 million of vaccines and therapies. That's pretty much all in our pharma Services business, it's not in the bioproduction business. Yes. So Matt, on the other end markets, when I think there's a lot of noise from the pandemic unwind, but when I kind of see through that, good growth really across all of the main geographies. So nothing really to call out there. Really, the main piece is just the timing on the bioproduction and instrumentation being stronger in Q3, as Marc outlined in terms of change our guide assumptions. Thanks. Yes. And then, Dan, particularly on the electron microscopy business where customers can't service themselves. So you have some customers that can be efficient service from other kind of lower end instrumentation. But from electromicroscopy standpoint, they're really looking for us to step up and help them with that. So that continued, as Marc said, that continued tailwind is very significant. Yes. I think we outlined the key changes. I think one thing that's hard for people to model is kind of where the vaccines and therapies changes. When I think about Q1 that was all in the Life Science Solutions segment. That's Biosciences business as well as Bioproduction. So from a year-over-year change, that was, I think, about an eight percentage point impact on the segment. That lessens as a headwind when I think about that going forward, but still most of that change in that revenue stream is in that segment as I think about the year as a whole. But nothing significant changing underneath other than we've already identified in terms of the overall guide."

            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of very strong financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. I'm pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our company, especially within the context of a slightly more challenging macro environment. Our continued success is the result of our proven growth strategy that trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.71 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.33 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.03 per share. At the beginning of the year, we set out appropriately ambitious guidance for 2023 and Q1 demonstrates that we're delivering against that. Let me turn to our end markets. We delivered very strong performance in Q1, driven by outstanding execution from our team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Pandemic related activity performed as we had expected during the quarter. As a reminder, the impact of the headwind from the revenue runoff can be seen in pharma and biotech due to vaccines and therapies and in diagnostics and healthcare due to COVID-19 testing. Let me give you some color on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered growth in the mid-single digits for the quarter. During the quarter, we had very strong performance in our pharma services, clinical research and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single digits in the quarter. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including chromatography, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, as well as the research and safety market channel. Academic and government demand were strong in all regions. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high-single digits for the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses, including electron microscopy, chemical analysis and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q1, revenue was approximately 45% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses. I'll now turn to our proven growth strategy, which enables us to continue to deliver differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our growth strategy consists of three pillars developing high impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, innovation. We had an excellent start to the year as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses during the first quarter. These technologies are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In elemental analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ Plus ICP-MS Analyzer. This ICP mass spectrometry system simplifies analysis of trace elements in complicated samples, including the identification of heavy metals in soil and water as well as toxic elements in food and beverage. In Genetic Sciences, we launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q AutoRun dPCR Suite, an automated digital PCR solution to increase productivity for molecular research, including cell and gene therapy and cancer research. In our Biosciences business, we launched the Invitrogen DynaGreen, microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification. This new product will help our customers to reduce the environmental impact of life science research and builds on our long history of innovation and market leadership in bioscience reagents. And in our Clinical Diagnostics business, we launched the Thermo Scientific DRI Tramadol assay, which broadens our extensive toxicology portfolio with a new drug of abuse assay to help fight the opioid crisis. These are just a few examples of the innovation going on across our company, and I'm excited about the robust pipeline of products that will be launched throughout the year. We also recently learned that Thermo Fisher was ranked number 22 on Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. This is a new award launched in 2023 based on product and process innovation and a company's culture. A really nice recognition of our team and their track record. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets by opening a new Gibco cell culture rapid prototyping facility at our existing site in Suzhou, China. This facility will help regional customers accelerate the transition of their cell culture media production into current good manufacturing practices. It will also ensure patients receive therapies manufactured to the highest level of safety, effectiveness, quality and purity. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I've had the opportunity to meet with dozens of our pharmaceutical and biotech customers since the beginning of the year, and our value proposition is clearly resonating. Our trusted partner status gives us an early understanding of customers unmet needs and the ability to generate insights that allow for deep collaborations that continue to advance scientific breakthroughs. During Q1, we achieved an exciting milestone in our strategic partnership with the University of California, San Francisco with the opening of a new cell therapy cGMP Manufacturing and Collaboration Center to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies for glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers. In this facility, we offer UCSF and other customer solutions for cell therapy development, from discovery to clinical research through to commercial manufacturing. Partnerships like this have the potential to transform clinical care. Another example of our customer value proposition and the trusted partner status that we have established with our pharma and biotech customers can be seen in the excellent performance of our clinical research business, which drove very strong growth in the quarter. I'm very excited by the revenue synergies that will drive both short-term and longer term growth in the business. The momentum is continuing to build and is benefiting both our clinical research business and other parts of the company. We're also working with very engaged customers on longer term projects to explore ways to reduce the time and cost of bringing drugs to market. By bringing our capabilities and expertise within our pharma services and clinical research businesses together, we are working to improve the effectiveness of the drug development process, benefiting both our customers and their patients. We have an exciting pilot underway that is utilizing dedicated resources and best-in-class technologies and capabilities to provide enhanced visibility and real-time data to the customer. This improves the speed of decision making and reduces potential delays from development to manufacturing to clinical trials. It can also help our customers take cost out of the process by reducing waste in the clinical supply process. This is really a nice example of why we are the trusted partner. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day, and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and the customer experience, while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. You can see the positive impact of our PPI Business System and our results in Q1. It is also allowed us to capitalize on the strong demand from customers for analytical instrumentation and has also helped us to effectively address the runoff and pandemic related activity and appropriately manage our costs. Moving to capital deployment. We've had an active start to the year both in strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We closed the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. It's great to have this business now as part of the company. The business is a fantastic fit with our Specialty Diagnostics business and we're leveraging our capabilities to take an excellent business and make it even better. The integration is going very smoothly and the business is performing very well, tracking ahead of plan. Our team is focused on advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders, and the innovation pipeline looks great. We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care in this area. In terms of return of capital, during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of stock and increased our dividend by 17%. So, overall, a great start to the year from capital deployment. During the quarter, we also advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities, including securing agreements to power all current US sites with 100% renewable energy by 2026. This is a significant contribution to our 2030 commitment to a 50% of reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. As we continue to transition away from fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy, we're also accelerating our progress towards our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We'll be releasing our latest Corporate Social Responsibility report later this quarter and will give our stakeholders a really substantive view on our continuous improvement and the positive impact that we're having. Let me now turn to our guidance. Since the beginning of the year, the macro environment has become slightly more challenging. We're stepping up to that challenge and our proven growth strategy, powered by our PPI Business System, is enabling us to maintain our ambitious full year outlook with revenues of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.70. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our very strong results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well. Our unique customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status and we're continuing to gain market share. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and shareholders, and we're incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance and an excellent 2023 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes. So Jack thanks for the question. Good morning. Our clinical research business, PPD had a very strong start to the year. The growth continues to be in the mid-teens. And it's doing really well. We had strong backlog. We had good level of authorization. So that business is continuing to benefit from the revenue synergies. You've seen that start to come into the numbers this year and I'm very excited about the prospect. Team is doing a really good job of executing. Environment is definitely a little bit more challenging, but the team is doing a good job to go out and capture the business. Our channel business, Fisher Scientific channel has done really well actually consistently for quite a number of years. It plays an amazing role in enabling our customers to do the research that they're doing and make sure they do that in an effective and efficient way. And the business is off to a good start. It has had good growth. And our best sense on share dynamics as it continues to win customers. So it's a well-performing business. Thanks, Jack. Sure. So, Rachel, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll step up a level first, and then I'll talk about the specifics of the question because as I look and read some of the other industry participants reports so far. Clearly, a noisy quarter in the industry. And when I frame that, as a reminder, when we started the year, we set out ambitious goals for 2023, right? And we do that every year. For us, a 7% core growth from an organic perspective against a 14% comparison and also have very strong earnings. So that's sort of as we came into the year. So what's different in late April versus February 1st when we set out our guidance. Well, the first thing is, we delivered a great chart to the year, right? Great Q1. Second, the macroeconomic environment is more challenging, right? And that leads to a slightly more cautious spend in all sectors of the economy, nothing to do with life science tools and pharma services. But we also see that in some of our customers as well in terms of the caution. Within our own company, a couple of our businesses are performing slightly better than our original guidance, and that's our analytical instruments business which had an excellent Q1 and we now have more visibility into Q3 for that business and that looks encouraging. The second business is doing a little bit better than our original guidance with Specialty Diagnostics is also a strong start. Bioproduction, which is where your question is really focused, we're going to see in the first half more headwinds than our original expectation. It's driven really by the customers are benefiting from the improved lead times that we're delivering against because we brought our -- completed our network expansion, right? So customers can get products more quickly. And our view is this is a temporal phenomenon, and we feel good about what the long-term prospects here. In terms of the specifics in terms of visibility and by customer sets and those things. I think the way that I think about it is, long-term, this is an incredible market with great growth. It's grown very high for many years in the past and has incredible tailwinds. It has a reasonably good visibility because it's related to customer production. And our expectation is that the second half of the year is better than the first half of the year in terms of the view. As a reminder, Rachel, it represents 10% of our revenue. So I think it's important to keep that in the context as well. Yes. So in terms of our instruments business, we really are benefiting from very strong adoption of our innovation, right? We just continue to bring out great products. As a reminder, during the pandemic, we continue to fuel and accelerate our R&D pipeline, and you're seeing the benefit of it. We are capitalizing on the semiconductor desire to move to the next generation of nodes, which uses our electromicroscopy. We're a key enabler for battery technology with our microscopes and our chromatography and mass spectrometry business doing incredibly well. So the strength here is broad based. Obviously, the 17% growth in the quarter, very strong. We would expect a good level of growth in Q2. And what we had said at the beginning of the year is that, that would moderate in the second half, and we think that moderation will be less than we originally expected in Q3. So we expect it to be a solid Q3, and we'll obviously have more visibility to Q4 when we report in July. So we're assuming that Q3 is little better than we expected and Q4 as we expected at this point because that's what we have visibility to. Thanks, Rachel. Yes. So Derek, the way that we manage the company, right, is the first thing we want to deliver differentiated performance in a given year that we would be proud of delivering and strengthen the company for the long-term, right? And that's the first set of principles. And that set of principles has served us very well for many years. And when you look at our track record, we do a good job of delivering short-term and strength in the long-term. When I think about the outlook for the year and where we are we feel good about the full year guidance at this point in time based on how Q1 has played out and the changes and we've laid out some of the assumptions around that for the balance of the year. And if those assumptions are largely the way the year plays out, we're going to be in a great position. If those assumptions are too conservative, we'll beat these numbers. If those assumptions are too aggressive then we will appropriately adjust guidance over time, right? And I'm not shy about any of those dynamics. We try to give you total transparency and I feel good about our outlook based on Q1 and the assumptions that we're making. Yeah, sure. Stephen? Yes. So when I think about the dynamics here, on the COVID vaccine, as Stephen said, my take is, it's played out almost exactly. I mean Q1 is exactly where we anticipated when we look at our visibility to the $500 million, I feel very good about that in terms of it because we know the contracts that we have and what activity has been booked there. So that's pretty straightforward. When I think about the bioproduction more generally, what I would say is in the very practical dynamics to go back to the pandemic, right? Huge demand, right, for these products. Those companies that were successful and unsuccessful and trying to bring out therapies and vaccines for response to the pandemic. That stressed lead times for everybody. Obviously, it varies differently by how much capacity, how well companies are on all those different dynamics, but lead times got super extended, right? For us and the nature of our products, our leadership in cell culture media and single use. Customers don't really order extra. It's not one of these things where you want to be stockpiling this stuff because they're very specific to the campaigns that you're running, right? So the dynamic becomes very simple. If we have a 30-week lead time, which was extended during the pandemic, you order 30 weeks -- with 30 weeks visibility. When we bring that lead time back into normal to say 15 weeks for simplicity, customers will work through what they ordered because they don't have to order as quickly because they know we're going to give them the product, right? And one of the themes that we said throughout the pandemic was we work super closely with our customers like incredible around the dialogue. So they trust that we're going to deliver when we say. So they didn't over order in the time when lead times got extended and they're ordering appropriately now. So can you call that to the month? No, of course, not. But we have a reasonable view that the first half is going to be a little bit softer than we originally had put in our expectations that the second half starts to pick up. And the good news is between instruments, especially diagnostics, it's offsetting at this point. So hopefully that's helpful. You're welcome. Yes. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in the spring, hope springs eternal in football because [indiscernible] hasn't been made yet. But effectively, from my perspective, pharma and biotech is a good question. If you take -- let's focus on the market itself, right? When I think about the quarter, we delivered mid-single digit growth, right? And when you think about what's embedded in that is obviously that's where the vaccine and therapy rolloff is from the prior year. So we did it exactly as we expected. So that basically you have double-digit growth, not a big normalization guys, but just to try to make it simple, if you didn't have a vaccine and therapy rolloff, you'd have double-digit growth in that segment. So most of the change from trajectories around that. I think the second thing to remember is that last year, we grew 14%. This year, we grew -- we're expecting to grow 7%. The expectation, obviously, is therefore our growth, while outstanding is going to be more moderate than last year and given the pharma and biotech is our largest customer segment, obviously, our expectation is that growth will moderate. I would say largely, Q1 was pretty similar to what we thought it would be with bioproduction being a little bit softer. You can say there's a little bit more caution in the smaller biotech customers. But do I think it's like dramatically different? I don't, right? And so we're working through that and we have strength in other parts of our mix. And that's kind of where we are. On all the details of each of the businesses by customer side, they don't really manage that way. And on the bioproduction side, as I said a little bit earlier, in total, it represents about 10% of our revenue. Yes. The team is doing a good job executing, right? They're doing a good job on navigating the various supply chain things that happened over the last couple of years and our shipments are at a high level we're going out and winning business. I think the strategy that the team has executed around breakthrough innovation. Customers find money when the products are really relevant. I mean that's been my experience. Over long periods of time or if you have great products, customers want them. So that's been a positive dynamic certainly for the instruments business. And what I would say is we definitely have challenging comparisons this year. We're off to a good start. And I would expect that growth will moderate a bit in the second half, but Q3 being a little bit better than we originally expected. You're welcome. Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. China actually played out pretty much as we expected in the quarter, right? So our expectation for Q1 was it was going to be slightly better than Q4 that you'd still see some of the impact of the unwind of the Zero COVID policy. And that as the year progresses, it will continue to strengthen from there. When I look at the first quarter in China, the business was down slightly. The core growth actually was high-single digits in the quarter. So that felt good. What I would say is, we expected stimulus to happen in the first quarter. It did happen in the first quarter. So that played out. It was good to see the Chinese government released money to the academic institutions. You see that in our instrument business. And so that played out well. And so I feel good about the outlook. Obviously, the geopolitical tensions are real, and that's an environment that is going to be around, I would suspect for a while. And we'll navigate through it, but China should be a good market for us this year and it has been historically. Stephen, anything on the -- I think our team is doing a great job of executing, right? They are out there serving customers and patients so that customers are making a great choice to work with us, right? They're doing a really good job. We clearly have a high level of new authorizations because of the combination of what Thermo Fisher brings and what PPD brought together, right? So there's a lot of customer interest. It shows up in authorization is showing up in our revenue now. That continues to build. And I'm excited. Next year will be year three. And, as a reminder, that's $250 million of revenue that we're assuming from a revenue synergy next year. So it's really exciting in terms of where it is, and I feel good about the performance of the business and the outlook. Thanks, Matt. Yes. So Vijay, we gave like 80,000 foot directional views on the markets at the end of the -- at the beginning of the year to set the guidance context. And when I think about the additional color that Steve and I have provided today, it really says that it's more business focused, which is actually how we manage our company. Instrument specialty diagnostics a little bit stronger bioproduction a little bit softer primarily in the first half. So that translates probably into a tiny little changes within the end markets, but nothing that really jumps out as something meaningfully different. What I would say is in terms of the early biotech, those are a great customer set that we have done a fantastic job serving. Yesterday, I was actually talking to roughly 400 members of that community at a customer event here in the Greater Boston area. And like the room was buzzing, not because I was speaking, but rather just like me walking in and this is such energy and excitement. So why is that? Because they're bringing through cures that are going to exception an enormous difference. The science is phenomenal. So there's clearly going to be more caution in that segment, depending on the funding environment, but the science is great. The passion is extraordinary. And we are the company that people come to advance the molecule from a scientific idea to an improved medicine. So it's customers that we love, we're going to do well. And we obviously generate the vast majority of our revenue from the large pharma and biotech customers, and they're doing well, and we've got a strong position there. So hopefully that at least gives you the qualitative context of how to think about it. Thanks, Vijay. Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. When I think about our instrument and equipment services business, what that business is, as a reminder for our investors is, we service our fleets of instruments. We also work at pharmaceutical and biotech campuses for our customers to manage their inventory, do those activities, help them with some of the things that they need done to run their labs as well as service other people's equipment and instrumentation. So that's what we do. In general, that is a steady, nicely growing business because we've had very significant growth in the volume of our instruments over the last couple of years that becomes a trailing tailwind for the business because you have a year or so of warranty, so you don't get any additional revenue effectively. But as the warranty rolls off, that does actually drive incremental demand. So your hypothesis there is correct, but that's one that continues to strengthen at this part of the cycle. Yes. So, Puneet, thanks for the questions. In terms of the IRA, I think customers are working through that in terms of what the implications and does that adjust any of the long-term decision making about what our preferred and what's their clinical trial strategy. We haven't seen anything material change at this point? I know there's certainly a lot of dialogue with government. I'm trying to make sure those policies do what they were intended to do. From a capital deployment perspective, this is a good environment from my perspective because you have less competition because of higher interest rates. From certainly private equity and so forth. So I think there's always competition, but I think that's good because that helps you pick and choose and get things at an appropriate valuation. So I think we'll continue to be active. Our pipeline is super busy like so I'm very excited about what we're looking at. You never know how these things actually play out in reality. But there's plenty going on and we'll be aggressive if the right transaction is available to us. So that's the benefit of the company performing well and a great track record of creating value through capital deployment. So thanks for the questions. I think at this point I'll do a quick wrap up. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're very pleased to deliver a strong quarter. We're incredibly well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. I'm looking forward to updating you on our upcoming Investor Day on May 24th. See you in New York City or virtually. And as always thank you for your support at Thermo Fisher Scientific."

So with that I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third-quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. We're seeing the benefit of our trusted partner status, which is resonating strongly with our customers and we're continuing to deliver differentiated performance in the short-term, while further strengthening our long-term competitive position. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.6 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.36 billion, adjusted operating margin was 22.3% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.28 per share. Our performance in the third quarter is allowing us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance once again and continues our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market. In the third quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected and we delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in growth. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits in Q3, including a five point headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapy revenue. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in growth for this customer segment. Performance in the quarter was led by our research and safety market channel and our clinical research business. In academic and government, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, growth was flat for the quarter. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good revenue growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as the healthcare market channel. As I reflect on the end markets, underlying conditions have modestly improved each quarter as the year has progressed. This is in line with the framing we provided as part of the guidance at the beginning of the year. Let me now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another great quarter of innovation. First, we continue to see the impact of our innovations launched over the past couple of years. It's gratifying that our innovations continue to receive industry recognition. This is a true testament to our teams. Most recently, the R&D 100 Awards, which recognizes the most revolutionary products in science and technology, honor two of our products, our Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, which launched last year, as well as our Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass spectrometer, which won gold in the market disruptors special recognition category as one of the most significant advancements in mass spectrometry in 15-years. Adoption of the Orbitrap Astral continues to be incredibly strong. During my customer interactions, I've had the opportunity to hear direct feedback on how significant our continued innovation is in helping our customers move science forward and advance their important work. The second part of innovation is we also had the benefit of a number of high-impact new products this quarter that we launched. To enable the development of advanced materials, we launched the Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope, which integrates a number of our advanced analytical technologies into a seamless and user-friendly workflow. This offers researchers deeper insights into the chemical nature of the most sophisticated advanced materials down to the atomic level. The Iliad incorporates our most innovative high-resolution spectrometer to accurately determine the composition of materials, as well as our proprietary energy filter for detailed imaging and chemical analysis of samples. We recently unveiled Iliad at the European Microscopy Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the feedback has been incredibly positive. Turning to innovations in life sciences within our biosciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems MagMAX Sequential DNA/RNA kit, which maximizes the isolation of DNA and RNA from blood cancer samples, helping researchers identify unique insights of cancer-causing genetic alterations. And we also launched the Invitrogen Vivofectamine Delivery Solutions, a novel method for delivering nucleic acids into multiple targets with therapeutic effect, paving the way for groundbreaking new medicines. Let me give you a quick update on our progress in building on the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. Last month at our Investor Day, you heard us highlight this element of our growth strategy and I'd like to bring some additional context to bring it to life. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers. As you know, we have an unparalleled customer access and this helps us understand their near and long-term priorities. Our scale, depth of capabilities and accumulated experience is truly resonating with customers as they rely on us to accelerate their innovation, enhance their productivity and advance their important work. This translated into meaningful commercial wins with customers during the quarter, which speaks to the ongoing strength of our growth strategy and our ability to gain share now and in the future. I also visited China in August and spent time meeting with government officials and customers. We have strong relationships there based on our track record of positive impact and our long history in the country. Our conversations were focused on how we can collaborate to enable our customer success. I came away from the visit, seeing firsthand how well-positioned we are to capitalize on the market opportunities when the economy picks up in China. Let me now give you an example from the third quarter and how we advanced customer partnerships and collaborations. In our clinical next-gen sequencing business, we announced our partnership with the National Cancer Institute, myeloMATCH precision medicine umbrella trial. That's going to leverage our next-generation sequencing technology to test patients for specific biomarkers, so they can be matched more quickly with optimal treatments based on their unique cancer profiles. We also continue to expand our capabilities to meet our customers' current and future needs. To enhance our oral solid dose formulation capabilities for our pharma and biotech customers, we expanded our pharma services manufacturing footprint in Cincinnati, Ohio and Bend, Oregon. In our clinical research business, we announced the expansion of our global laboratory services network with a new bioanalytical lab in Gothenburg, Sweden, which will support pharmaceutical and biotech customers with advanced laboratory services to support all phases of development. So it was an excellent quarter of advancing our growth strategy. Let me give you a quick update on the impact of our PPI business system in Q3. PPI is embedded in our culture and there are many examples that I could share from the quarter. As always, our PPI business system and our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day to enable outstanding execution. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of PPI reflected in the strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the quarter. During the quarter, we further enhanced our supply chain in Asia-Pacific by optimizing inventory across our network. While in Europe, we further streamlined and automated our manufacturing processes for high-end analytical instruments to meet strong demand. Now let me turn to corporate social responsibility. We have a CSR strategy that delivers competitive advantage. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by the environment we create for our colleagues, how we support our communities and being a good steward of our planet. Today, I just want to spend a moment on our colleagues, because none of our success is possible without the work of our amazing team around the world. Our colleague safety is always our top priority and the impact of Hurricane Helene was especially concerning to me as we have about 1,000 colleagues in Asheville, North Carolina, one of the hardest hit areas. In Asheville, we manufacture lab equipment and have a customer service center. I'm so grateful our colleagues there are safe. I'm also thankful for the support of our extended teams, who have provided assistance to those colleagues impacted. It's truly heartwarming to see how our team comes together to support each other. Turning now to capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create tremendous value. We do this through a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Let me update you on our recent acquisitions. The Binding Site now our protein diagnostics business continues to perform exceptionally well. In the quarter, we achieved an IVDR claim extension in the European Union for our Optilite Freelight MX Kappa Kit. Until now, these kits have been solely used in multiple myeloma diagnostics and monitoring. The extension now allows for the product to aid in the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This is an excellent example of our M&A approach enabling a great business to be even better under our ownership, creating value for all stakeholders. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Olink at the beginning of the quarter. The integration is progressing smoothly. The business is well-positioned for a bright future. As you heard at our Investor Day, we're excited by the role we're playing in advancing proteomics research. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07 and we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our growth has been steadily increasing as we've gone through 2024 and we once again have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. And we're well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company and provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the third quarter played out versus what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. On the top line, both organic revenue growth and core organic revenue growth increased sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was largely in line with what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.06 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q3. That was a net impact of the following: $0.02 of strong operational performance, $0.06 of lower net interest cost due to favorable timing of cash flow generation and more favorable rates than has been assumed. These are partially offset by an additional $0.02 of FX headwind versus the assumption for the quarter. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. Year-to-date free cash flow is 22% higher than the same period last year. So we had another strong quarter and are well-positioned to deliver differentiated financial performance in 2024. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q3. Beginning with earnings per share, and in the quarter, adjusted EPS was $5.28, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.25. On the top line, Q3 reported revenue, organic revenue and core organic revenue were all flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $100 million. This was largely from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q3, North America declined low-single-digits and Europe, Asia-Pacific and China within Asia-Pacific were all flat year-over-year. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.36 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 190 basis points lower than Q3 last year, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, this enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and partially offset the expected impact of unfavorable mix this quarter. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $346 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation and R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.3% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line, our Q3 net interest expense was $80 million, which is $33 million lower than Q3 2023 due to higher cash balances and short-term investments. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5% and average diluted shares were $384 million in Q3, approximately $4 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date free cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $4.5 billion and after investing $880 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $3.1 billion of capital through the acquisition of Olink. And we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.4%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 2% and organic revenue was 4% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was driven by the impact of the pandemic. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 35.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q3, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix, retention costs related to the Olink acquisition and strategic invest. In the Analytical Instruments segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, 180 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 4% versus the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered strong growth and are led by our healthcare market channel and our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 25.9%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 2023. And during the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth in this segment was led by our research and safety market channel. The runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue had a mid-single-digit impact on the growth in this segment in Q3 and this was offset by very good underlying growth in our clinical research and pharma services businesses. And as expected, Q3 adjusted operating income declined 18% and adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, which is 290 basis points slower than Q3 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the expected unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Marc outlined, our strong performance in Q3, we're raising our 2024 full-year adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07, which is a $0.03 increase at the midpoint. As we've done in the past two quarters, at the midpoint, we banked half of the Q3 beat and maintained the remainder as additional cushions for Q4. Revenue guidance continues to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and we continue to assume the core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We also continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System execution is once again enabling us to take share. Our updated 2024 guidance continues to assume an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%. And we now expect net interest cost to be in the range of $340 million to $380 million for the year. So another strong quarter, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. So it would be helpful to remind you some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and between $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. We continue to expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And for the year, we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We returned $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and in Q3, we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. And finally, as you think about the outlook for the year, you should consider the midpoint of our guidance range as the current view of the most likely outcome for the year. Implied in that midpoint is Q4 revenue of $11.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.96. That would reflect 2.5% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is unchanged from the previous guidance and is a continuation of our sequential increase in growth that we delivered each quarter throughout the year. And as a reminder, Q4 organic revenue growth has the benefit of two extra selling days, which equates to approximately 1% and a headwind from vaccines and therapies of approximately 2.5%. So to conclude, we had another strong quarter and we're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance for all of our stakeholders in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking the question. Marc, maybe kick things off with you. You talked a number of times during the prepared remarks about some sequential improvement as the year has gone on. And I think the view is that will continue into 4Q and into 2025? It looks like this continues to be a very gradual recovery, just a very slight step up in market conditions as we go through the year. No major changes, no step function change. Do you expect that pace of recovery to continue into the next quarter and into 2025, or do you think there could be an inflection at some point over the next two to four quarters where things accelerate a little bit? I guess, put another way, sort of what's holding the market back from a faster snapback?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Good morning. So what I thought to do is maybe actually put some framing comments overall, then I'll get to your 2025 question as well. So for the Q&A session today, as I think about the third quarter as we sit here in October and how the year has progressed: first, it was a good quarter. And the market conditions, they've been in line with our expectations and they've been modestly improving as we progress through the year, which is what we expected to happen, so it's good that that's playing out that way. In Q3 for us, organic growth was flat. We were able to offset a three-point headwind from the runoff of COVID-19-related revenues. So it puts it in context of how we're performing. Each quarter, our organic growth has improved as the year has progressed. And I'm really quite excited by the fact that we're expecting the fourth quarter to return to growth organically, which is a good thing. Operationally, we're executing our proven growth strategy. We have strong financial management that's been able to allow us to increase our adjusted EPS guidance each quarter and kind of make all of this a non-event in terms of performance. So all of that is kind of the framing for the discussion today. So when I think about 2025 and I'll kind of -- just kind of boil it all together into sort of how do I think about the year. The first thing is, from our perspective, the best time to provide guidance is on our Q4 2024 call, which is in January. At that point, we're going to have the latest view of the market and the macro conditions and how ultimately we finish the year. And what we're going to approach it as the same as we did in 2024. We're going to give you our best thinking for the year ahead and then execute against it. From my own perspective and personally, I'm excited for 2025, right? And as I think about it in October, the end markets are modestly improving throughout the year. We're excited that in the fourth quarter, we're going to return to growth organically. For us in 2025, what I would say is that it's the final year of the runoff of the pandemic-related activity and while that'll still be a headwind to growth, it's going to be less than it was in 2024. And then I always think about how we're performing, right? And as a company, we're executing well. Our growth strategy is driving share gain. Our PPI Business System enables outstanding execution. We have a disciplined capital deployment strategy that generates returns. Our acquisitions are performing well. And we're going to be well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance once again in 2025. So we'll look forward to updating you on that in January as we have the best view of what the environment is.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, all right. Thanks, I appreciate that. I guess for my follow-up, maybe we'll -- I want to dig a little into pharma and biotech. As a customer group, you talked about low-single-digit decline, and obviously, there's some headwind there from the COVID-19 runoff as well. But any additional color you can give on how that segment's performing, whether between larger pharma or smaller biotech, whether it's between some of the reagent and businesses in biosciences, versus the clinical trial business or the pharma services business, just that's been a focus point for investors, and would love to get some color on that?\nMarc Casper: So you're going to get a lot of fan mail from your peers on this call, sort of asking each of all the questions within pharma and biotech. I'll take a high-level shot at it. So first, when I think about the third quarter and how things progressed, you're seeing a sequential improvement, which is good. And when I think about underlying performance, right? We obviously had a mid-single-digit headwind from the pandemic runoff. So you're seeing that the conditions continue to improve. In aggregate, obviously, they're somewhat muted, because they're below the long-term expectations for the market growth, right? So that's nothing surprising where the positives are sort of the data points as we sit here, confidence in biotech is improving, funding in biotech in the industry has been modestly improving as the year progresses. So, it's definitely meaningfully better than it was in 2023. And when I think about the large pharma, in a way, I think it's kind of normal distribution amongst the different companies, some doing extraordinarily well, others adjusting to how their pipelines are performing. And customers have been adjusting to the IRA, and you see that in a more muted growth environment, but we're obviously incredibly well positioned with this customer base and we're clearly delivering differentiated performance relative to others. So the trusted partner status, our unique value proposition, these things resonate. So we feel good about the long-term health of pharma and biotech and how we're performing this year. Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Ryskin: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions, you guys. First up on the CRO, maybe following up on some of your comments there about pharma versus biotech, but really specifically looking at PPD here. Could you give us an update on how much of PPD is indexed to large pharma customers versus biotech? And did you see any differences in trends across the two customer types this quarter within PPD? And then as a follow-up, some of your peers in the CRO sector have started to create some noise around their outlooks on 2025 and what that recovery looks like. So for Thermo, if PPD is more or less, let's call it a mid-single-digit business this year and normal is 8% for PPD, how are you thinking about the pace of recovery for PPD into 2025?\nMarc Casper: So, Rachel, thanks for the question. Good morning. When I think about our clinical research business, actually it's performing well. When I think about the business delivered growth in the quarter, it obviously has a meaningful headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies of CRO-related activity. So from that perspective, I feel good about how we're doing. Next quarter, I'm going to really spend some time talking about the magic that we're unlocking on the combination between our pharma services and our clinical research business and how that really adds differentiated value for our customers in terms of performance. So I want to focus on that one. We just announced how we talk about that to our customers. We've been doing this for quite some time and it's really been quite spectacular. So our momentum with the customer base is quite good and we're executing well. When I think about the -- our position, we have a slightly larger position serving biotech more broadly than we do serving pharma within clinical research in terms of the mix of the business, but both customer sets are very important. And when I think about some of the highlights, the biotech customers more quickly adopt that unified set of capabilities, because it's easier for them just organizationally to leverage all of pulling everything together one. So you're seeing that in authorizations and momentum, and biotech is particularly moving in the right direction. So that's how we see it. In terms of the 25% and long-term 8%, all of these things, we don't -- as you know, we're going to give our views on '25 next year. And we don't go -- we don't guide down to the business unit performance within the company, but we'll give the puts and takes of what's growing faster and what's growing at the average and what's growing more slowly than the average when we get to the guidance next year.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Understood. And then on my second question, just around Life Science Solutions. So growth was a little softer than what the Street was looking for this quarter for that segment. We've heard from a few of your bioprocessing peers that pointed towards solid trends in 3Q -- so can you unpack for us the performance within that Life Sciences Solutions segment, how did bioproduction versus biosciences and genetic sciences trend in the quarter? And what, if anything, fall below your expectations there?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Rachel, thanks for the question, and thank you for the framing of the question. Because actually, the numbers are different than what seems to have been modeled in the analyst models, but actually, the business performed in line with our expectations for the quarter. So when I think about what happened in the quarter, in the third quarter, we had our largest impact of the COVID roll-off in this segment. That's something we knew, something -- that's why it came in line with our expectations relative to the other quarters. Q3 was the most difficult comparison in the COVID-related activities for us. So that probably explains a little bit of the modeling difference. In terms of how our business is performing, bioproduction is certainly the one that gets the most interest because there are a number of companies that are just bioproduction companies that have stocks out there. Actually, the quarter played out as we expected. It was nice to see strong momentum in orders, both sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue continues to progress in the right direction sequentially in terms of growth, and that obviously is going to be less of a headwind going forward and ultimately going to in not-distant future in terms of bioproduction, that's good. The only other commentary I would make on the LSS segment, it's not an enormous business, but our clinical sequencing business is doing really well, right? You see the announcements I talked about. One of them with the National Cancer Institute. You saw after the quarter-end, an announcement from one of our customers in terms of companion diagnostic approved using our sequencing for brain cancer. These are really positives in terms of customers applying our technology to make a huge difference on patient lives and the course of treatment, so that business is doing quite well. Thank you, Rachel.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.\nMarc Casper: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Maybe for Marc, I hate to ask a question about month-by-month dynamics, but can you just talk a little bit more about how the quarter played out? The reason I ask is core organic growth was flat. I think the Street was looking for 1%, so technically missed that. And I always assume there's some conservatism embedded. So I was just curious, like did September fall short for some reason? If so, why? I know you talked about the hurricane, but just any color on kind of how the quarter played out would be great.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack, in terms of the growth, it was largely in line with what we expected to happen for the quarter. So from that perspective versus the external models, I always think there's a degree of accuracy between the Street and what we say we try to give as clear as we can on these calls about what our expectations are for the year and the upcoming quarter. And I think Stephen gave some very clear views again this quarter about the next one. So from our perspective, kind of, played out as we thought, in terms of the pacing through the quarter, largely as we expected, I would say, at the very, very end of the quarter, academic and government wasn't quite as strong as you normally would see. But like in the scale of our company, like a $10.5 billion-plus quarter, that's $10 million, $20 million. It's not a big number, but -- so I didn't really jump out any patterns of any significance in terms of how the month played out during the quarter.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Okay, and then for Stephen, on guidance, you still have a $900 million range from the bottom top end. I know you're putting us to the midpoint here, but was there any consideration to narrowing it was the real level of variability in the business?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, Jack. So for simplicity, we kept the range in our guidance from the last time around. And as you said, I encourage you to not overthink it. I'll just focus on the midpoint. That's the kind of current view where we most likely outcome for the quarter as we see it right now. And other than macro events, the largest swing factor for Q4 is likely to be the level of year-end spend by our customers.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Stephen.\nStephen Williamson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Alright, thank you and good morning Marc and Stephen. As we sit here nine months, you know, about 10 months into the year with nine months of financials in the books, the portfolio seems to be tracking the plan. That said, there are always puts and takes on what's working better or worse than original target? As we sit here today, what geographies, customer groups, product categories, however you want to frame it, what's tracking ahead of expectation? What's below expectation? And as you think about the next few quarters, would you expect things to normalize back to what you were targeting at the beginning of the year? Or are there seemingly some more durable changes to how things are coming together? I ask not just to look back, but also just as kind of we're thinking about exit rates looking ahead to 2025.\nMarc Casper: So Doug, thanks for the question. So if we go back to January and we say -- we had a set of expectations for the year, and those expectations have really played out with an incredible degree of precision so far through the first nine months. First quarter on revenue was a little bit higher. The next two quarters were super tight around what we expected, and we're looking forward to the fourth quarter where we return to growth. And when you unpack the different businesses, there's actually not a lot there in terms of them also performing differently than what we expected. And I'll come back to that with a couple of added things. But -- so it was not like something is meaningfully different than what we thought in January, better or worse. The two things we did talk about, about what we could change the range for this year, was how would biotech perform in terms of funding and what would happen in China, right? And biotech is progressing in the right direction. Funding is improving, confidence is improving. As you know, there's a lag between funding and ultimately how that flows into our industry. So that's encouraging relative to what we saw certainly in the previous couple of years in that dimension. So that kind of helps you think a little bit about market conditions going forward. The second was China. China has not progressed, right? In terms of economic activity has been incredibly muted in terms of the environment. The government did announce two different types of stimulus programs, actually interesting. First, that affect our industry in a positive way, which is around the equipment stimulus and the loan program that they have for their customers or their institutions. And we expect that's largely a 2025 impact and beyond, so that's encouraging. And more recently, they actually announced stimulus programs to spur economic growth and business confidence and consumer confidence that actually would also be helpful for the long-term there. So that one is more on the come, right, because it hasn't -- the words have said, but in terms of the impact as to the economy, it hasn't seen. So that will be a swing factor going forward on how that plays out. And then it turns within our businesses, probably the only thing that I would really call out is it really is awesome to see the adoption of our high-end technologies and analytical insurance, right? It's just -- it's amazing how customers, even though it's obviously it\u2019s a muted environment in total, right? The industry is declining this year, and that's nothing of a surprise. That business is just getting great adoption for our technologies. And it was one of the cool things we said during the pandemic when we were just really driving great growth, because of our response, we reinvested in R&D, and that reinvestment has really led to differential performance in terms of how our technology has been adopted. So I'd call that out. Is that massively different than what we expected in January? No, but it's great to see, and it's a little bit better than what we expected. And the offsets to that are immaterial across the rest of the company.\nDoug Schenkel: Thanks for all that, Marc. I think my follow-up is probably a Stephen question, but obviously, welcome either of you as always to chime in. As I look at our model, I'm reminded that from 2022 to 2024, your core growth would have been about 0% down about 5%, and about flat again this year, year-by-year. So in a period where revenue growth has been challenging, you've actually maintained operating margin at similar levels for two years in a row, assuming you meet guidance this year. So as growth starts to improve slowly, but surely into next year. Is it fair to assume that there could be outsized margin improvement and incremental margin generation, essentially the benefit of strong operating discipline through a challenging period. I guess, I'm just wondering if margin expansion gets back into the LRP range before revenue cash?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So thanks for the question. So just to frame up how we think about the long-term financials. So for us, long-term 7% to 9% top line growth, which enables 40 basis points to 50 basis points of expansion. So that's kind of how we think about the future. And then you get down to the near-term and could it be slightly higher? I think I've said in the past that certain aspects of our business, where volumes have been more challenged and we've appropriately addressed the cost base, that there's some incremental benefit that can come from the return to volumes in those businesses. So there's an aspect of this that could be slightly higher and as we get into the next year and give guidance in January, we've got to frame up kind of how we think about the world, what's the level of the top line growth. And then what's an appropriate level of margin expansion, which is always a trade-off between making sure we get good profitability for our shareholders and then appropriately investing in the business as we think about going forward. So that kind of frames it up and look forward to getting to the details on the next call. Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Schenkel: All right, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tyko, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Marc, wondering if you can just touch a little bit more on some of the drivers in LPS. You talked about, obviously, the channel, the safety and the market channel. But curious, we've heard more about share gains for Fisher. So I'm curious if you can kind of comment on that dynamic? And then you didn't call out PPD and Patheon within your comments specifically on that. I'm just wondering if they were actually up in the quarter.\nMarc Casper: You want to start, Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Yes, Tycho. So in my prepared remarks, I did talk about the dynamic where when you think about the underlying growth in both pharma services and clinical research, that offset the significant pandemic headwinds. So from an organic growth standpoint, that's kind of a net neutral. But when I think about what the underlying growth is there, it's strong. Marc, in terms of color...\nMarc Casper: No, the channel is doing really well. Actually, both the health care market channel and the research and safety market channel continue to do well. They're delivering nice growth and actually winning some really nice customers, which bodes well for the future. So part of the commentary that I talked about, customer wins and those things in my remarks, really a number of our businesses. But in those comments are really around large wins and channel clearly had some nice ones during the quarter, which doesn't show up at all in revenue in the quarter that you win them, but over the coming quarters ahead, it really is quite a positive.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then I guess a follow-up just on the margins for the lab products and services. Obviously, you had the vaccine and therapy runoff. Is there anything you're willing to comment around price in this environment, the ability to potentially take more? Or are you getting more -- try to grab more CRO and CDMO work? And then how are you also thinking about capacity expansion for Patheon? Obviously, we saw Novo offload one of the Catalent facilities in Europe. I'm just curious how you're thinking about as more capacity comes to market, both from Novo and Catalent, but also Wuxi uptick, how interesting that might be for you.\nMarc Casper: You want to talk about price in aggregate\u2026\nStephen Williamson: Yes, price in aggregate for the company, we're just over 1% of price for the quarter. So still ahead of the kind of the normal run rate that we see as kind of 0.5% to 1% price on a net basis across the whole company. So a trend that's similar to what we've seen in the further first 3 quarters of the year, it's been consistent.\nMarc Casper: Yes, I'd say probably the pricing environment is back to normal. It's a good industry. Price goes up modestly each year. You have the dynamic inflation where price went up certainly more than what is usual and we're kind of back to the normal dynamic. In terms of our pharma services business, capacity expansions, as everyone knows, we've expanded our investments in sterile fill/finish capacity and have a number of lines that are coming online, if you will, during the course of 2025 and 2026 to support customer demand. So that's positive. That does put pressure on margins in the short term, because there's costs in training and getting the kind of the qualification process for the facilities. But certainly, as we get through 2025, you'll see higher levels of utilization on that capacity to support the strong growth in sterile fill/finish. And so that's the dynamic there. As I announced in my remarks, because of the specific capabilities of interest in oral solid dose, which is not our biggest part of our offering in drug products. We did do some capacity expansions in Bend, Oregon and Cincinnati, Ohio to meet the customer demand, which is good on the development side of the equation. So that's the dynamic there.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Tycho.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: [Technical Difficulty] analytical Instrument segment, you've shown pretty consistent growth in what has been, I would call, a challenging environment. I know that Astral and microscopy have been big drivers of that. If you strip those two out and just look at the rest of your instrument categories, could you maybe talk about what demand looks like from them in those interesting categories from the biopharma side as well as other customers? And do you sense any kind of replacement cycle kicking in for some of those instruments as we move to '25? Just any thoughts on that would be great?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So when I think about analytical instruments, we had 3% organic growth in the quarter playing out as we expected. Obviously, innovation really matters. For us, we've been able to launch a number of products that have been adopted. Actually on the high-end, we talk about Iliad in this particular quarter, that bodes well to continue to drive momentum in electron microscopy obviously, Astral has done very well as you noted. Stellar, which we launched last quarter, the early interest is quite strong. So those things are going well. Innuvion, which is non- chromatography more of a midrange technology, very important in that particular category of chromatography, incredibly strong demand. So our innovation has been well adopted. When you take out all of those things, you just kind of say the routine capital equipment aspects of instruments, actually pretty muted conditions, right? Nothing is surprising. When we talk about for the full-year for the whole company, to have market down in the low-single-digits, you would expect capital equipment to have you the conditions they are. And a big driver of that, obviously, is China, which is, in instrument businesses for the whole industry, is a large portion of demand and obviously that market is most challenged. So exactly where we are in the replacement cycle for those things, I think it really varies by customer, by product type and all of that. And we didn't see any particular pattern that jumped out to indicate any change in trajectory.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thanks. And then, Stephen, just a modeling question for you. Just the implied Q4 operating margin looks like over 100 basis point step-up to get to that full-year guide? I understand there's a return to growth expectation on the top line, some probably some gross margin leverage. Is there anything on the cost saving guides or mix that we should be aware of driving that step up in margins for the Q4?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So for Q4, the kind of the midpoint of that guide is a 50 basis points increase year-over-year for the quarter, and that's in line with when I think about the margin profile. It's really the step-up in the level of revenue and the kind of the seasonality to our revenue profile. So it logically makes sense and look at it sequentially in terms of the change.\nMatt Sykes: Okay, thank you.\nStephen Williamson: Great. Thanks, Matt.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Great. Maybe, Marc, just on pharma R&D, headlines have been mixed, but we just looked at like a global analysis of R&D trends. And then actually they look pretty good for large pharma, up nearly 8%, and kind of global pharma, up like mid-5s? So I'm just wondering, like trying to square the circle with kind of the weaker end market growth that you're kind of base your guide on and maybe why we're not seeing what appears to be a decent level of R&D growth, you're not translating into better revenues. Like has anything changed? Maybe is there more dollars going to service? Inflation? Or just in terms of the traditional amount of dollars that your business would see from R&D, is anything kind of different this time?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. I think one element is significant investment by our customers in AI. Unfortunately not on medical instruments. But when I think about generative AI and where the spending on technology, there's a significant piece to that, what you need to factor that in the guide.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Dan, probably when we think about pharma and biotech, right, it covers the full spectrum of activity. And one of the things that's within that is on production, you have the headwinds across the industry of bioproduction, right? So there's not like an R&D specific call out that you can derive from the numbers. We all understand the runoff on the pandemic is largely in the clinical research side and largely in the bioproduction and pharma services side. So that's a little bit of what's muting the growth in total for our industry. In terms of the dialogue that I've had with customers and sort of what's the tone? People are super excited about the pipeline, right? Whether it's the fact of the GLP-1s and the scale of a high-impact medicine that it just really is getting people excited. But there's really interesting work going on, on Alzheimer's, which is fantastic. And you've seen some interesting approvals in other neurological diseases that there's just a lot of excitement about pipelines and opportunities. And so I believe that the data you're quoting about the R&D investment is looking good, it reflects that customers have optimism for the future. And ultimately, that's going to translate into our space. So which is why we're so confident about the long-term prospects for our industry.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one follow-up on China. A few peers have discussed that they're seeing a pause in instrument spending ahead of the stimulus next year. I think you mentioned in a prior question, how like China instrument demand is kind of a weaker spot. Any color there? And as the stimulus comes through, is this going to be a meaningful lift for you guys in '25? Or do you think it will be more modest? Thanks a lot.\nMarc Casper: Dan, thanks. So when I think about China and I think about stimulus, certainly a discussion I had when I was meeting with government officials and certainly with customers as well, really, activity has been around applying for the funding, right, and going through that process. So there's quite a bit of that activity. So I'm not sure that trade is something else off, but it might have. Like I don't know, like, none of the customers specifically mentioned it, but I didn't ask the question that way. I was much more interested about how are they tapping into the available new funds and how are they thinking about it, and there seems to be optimism and enthusiasm for the upcoming investments. So I think stimulus will be a 2025 activity, maybe a little bit in Q4, probably not all that significant, but -- so that's how I think about what's going on in China. The other thing from the China trip that I came away with -- and obviously, I knew it going in, but we are incredibly well positioned in the country. I mean we have deep relationships with our customers, very strong earned relationships with government. Being a scale player for 40-years in the country and supporting their response to the pandemic, various crises in the past, just a good local participant to help society out there, we benefit from that. And we're well positioned to help our customers, and we have great discussions about customer dialogue with where can we collaborate, and how can we help them, have the Chinese population be healthier through our technology business. So I think as the economy improves there, we're going to be well positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you for the questions today. Let me just make a quick closing comment. And it's good to have another strong quarter behind us. And we're very well positioned to deliver differentiated performance into 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and to build an even brighter future for our company. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full year performance in our January call. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you very much, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company and provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the third quarter played out versus what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. On the top line, both organic revenue growth and core organic revenue growth increased sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was largely in line with what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.06 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q3. That was a net impact of the following: $0.02 of strong operational performance, $0.06 of lower net interest cost due to favorable timing of cash flow generation and more favorable rates than has been assumed. These are partially offset by an additional $0.02 of FX headwind versus the assumption for the quarter. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. Year-to-date free cash flow is 22% higher than the same period last year. So we had another strong quarter and are well-positioned to deliver differentiated financial performance in 2024. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q3. Beginning with earnings per share, and in the quarter, adjusted EPS was $5.28, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.25. On the top line, Q3 reported revenue, organic revenue and core organic revenue were all flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $100 million. This was largely from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q3, North America declined low-single-digits and Europe, Asia-Pacific and China within Asia-Pacific were all flat year-over-year. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.36 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 190 basis points lower than Q3 last year, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, this enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and partially offset the expected impact of unfavorable mix this quarter. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $346 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation and R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.3% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line, our Q3 net interest expense was $80 million, which is $33 million lower than Q3 2023 due to higher cash balances and short-term investments. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5% and average diluted shares were $384 million in Q3, approximately $4 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date free cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $4.5 billion and after investing $880 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $3.1 billion of capital through the acquisition of Olink. And we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.4%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 2% and organic revenue was 4% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was driven by the impact of the pandemic. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 35.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q3, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix, retention costs related to the Olink acquisition and strategic invest. In the Analytical Instruments segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, 180 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 4% versus the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered strong growth and are led by our healthcare market channel and our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 25.9%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 2023. And during the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth in this segment was led by our research and safety market channel. The runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue had a mid-single-digit impact on the growth in this segment in Q3 and this was offset by very good underlying growth in our clinical research and pharma services businesses. And as expected, Q3 adjusted operating income declined 18% and adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, which is 290 basis points slower than Q3 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the expected unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Marc outlined, our strong performance in Q3, we're raising our 2024 full-year adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07, which is a $0.03 increase at the midpoint. As we've done in the past two quarters, at the midpoint, we banked half of the Q3 beat and maintained the remainder as additional cushions for Q4. Revenue guidance continues to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and we continue to assume the core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We also continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System execution is once again enabling us to take share. Our updated 2024 guidance continues to assume an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%. And we now expect net interest cost to be in the range of $340 million to $380 million for the year. So another strong quarter, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. So it would be helpful to remind you some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and between $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. We continue to expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And for the year, we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We returned $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and in Q3, we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. And finally, as you think about the outlook for the year, you should consider the midpoint of our guidance range as the current view of the most likely outcome for the year. Implied in that midpoint is Q4 revenue of $11.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.96. That would reflect 2.5% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is unchanged from the previous guidance and is a continuation of our sequential increase in growth that we delivered each quarter throughout the year. And as a reminder, Q4 organic revenue growth has the benefit of two extra selling days, which equates to approximately 1% and a headwind from vaccines and therapies of approximately 2.5%. So to conclude, we had another strong quarter and we're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance for all of our stakeholders in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Yes, Jack. So for simplicity, we kept the range in our guidance from the last time around. And as you said, I encourage you to not overthink it. I'll just focus on the midpoint. That's the kind of current view where we most likely outcome for the quarter as we see it right now. And other than macro events, the largest swing factor for Q4 is likely to be the level of year-end spend by our customers. Thanks. Yes. So thanks for the question. So just to frame up how we think about the long-term financials. So for us, long-term 7% to 9% top line growth, which enables 40 basis points to 50 basis points of expansion. So that's kind of how we think about the future. And then you get down to the near-term and could it be slightly higher? I think I've said in the past that certain aspects of our business, where volumes have been more challenged and we've appropriately addressed the cost base, that there's some incremental benefit that can come from the return to volumes in those businesses. So there's an aspect of this that could be slightly higher and as we get into the next year and give guidance in January, we've got to frame up kind of how we think about the world, what's the level of the top line growth. And then what's an appropriate level of margin expansion, which is always a trade-off between making sure we get good profitability for our shareholders and then appropriately investing in the business as we think about going forward. So that kind of frames it up and look forward to getting to the details on the next call. Thanks, Doug. Yes, Tycho. So in my prepared remarks, I did talk about the dynamic where when you think about the underlying growth in both pharma services and clinical research, that offset the significant pandemic headwinds. So from an organic growth standpoint, that's kind of a net neutral. But when I think about what the underlying growth is there, it's strong. Marc, in terms of color... Yes, price in aggregate for the company, we're just over 1% of price for the quarter. So still ahead of the kind of the normal run rate that we see as kind of 0.5% to 1% price on a net basis across the whole company. So a trend that's similar to what we've seen in the further first 3 quarters of the year, it's been consistent. Yes. So for Q4, the kind of the midpoint of that guide is a 50 basis points increase year-over-year for the quarter, and that's in line with when I think about the margin profile. It's really the step-up in the level of revenue and the kind of the seasonality to our revenue profile. So it logically makes sense and look at it sequentially in terms of the change. Great. Thanks, Matt. Yes. I think one element is significant investment by our customers in AI. Unfortunately not on medical instruments. But when I think about generative AI and where the spending on technology, there's a significant piece to that, what you need to factor that in the guide."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third-quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. We're seeing the benefit of our trusted partner status, which is resonating strongly with our customers and we're continuing to deliver differentiated performance in the short-term, while further strengthening our long-term competitive position. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.6 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.36 billion, adjusted operating margin was 22.3% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.28 per share. Our performance in the third quarter is allowing us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance once again and continues our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market. In the third quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected and we delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in growth. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits in Q3, including a five point headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapy revenue. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in growth for this customer segment. Performance in the quarter was led by our research and safety market channel and our clinical research business. In academic and government, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, growth was flat for the quarter. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good revenue growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as the healthcare market channel. As I reflect on the end markets, underlying conditions have modestly improved each quarter as the year has progressed. This is in line with the framing we provided as part of the guidance at the beginning of the year. Let me now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another great quarter of innovation. First, we continue to see the impact of our innovations launched over the past couple of years. It's gratifying that our innovations continue to receive industry recognition. This is a true testament to our teams. Most recently, the R&D 100 Awards, which recognizes the most revolutionary products in science and technology, honor two of our products, our Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, which launched last year, as well as our Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass spectrometer, which won gold in the market disruptors special recognition category as one of the most significant advancements in mass spectrometry in 15-years. Adoption of the Orbitrap Astral continues to be incredibly strong. During my customer interactions, I've had the opportunity to hear direct feedback on how significant our continued innovation is in helping our customers move science forward and advance their important work. The second part of innovation is we also had the benefit of a number of high-impact new products this quarter that we launched. To enable the development of advanced materials, we launched the Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope, which integrates a number of our advanced analytical technologies into a seamless and user-friendly workflow. This offers researchers deeper insights into the chemical nature of the most sophisticated advanced materials down to the atomic level. The Iliad incorporates our most innovative high-resolution spectrometer to accurately determine the composition of materials, as well as our proprietary energy filter for detailed imaging and chemical analysis of samples. We recently unveiled Iliad at the European Microscopy Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the feedback has been incredibly positive. Turning to innovations in life sciences within our biosciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems MagMAX Sequential DNA/RNA kit, which maximizes the isolation of DNA and RNA from blood cancer samples, helping researchers identify unique insights of cancer-causing genetic alterations. And we also launched the Invitrogen Vivofectamine Delivery Solutions, a novel method for delivering nucleic acids into multiple targets with therapeutic effect, paving the way for groundbreaking new medicines. Let me give you a quick update on our progress in building on the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. Last month at our Investor Day, you heard us highlight this element of our growth strategy and I'd like to bring some additional context to bring it to life. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers. As you know, we have an unparalleled customer access and this helps us understand their near and long-term priorities. Our scale, depth of capabilities and accumulated experience is truly resonating with customers as they rely on us to accelerate their innovation, enhance their productivity and advance their important work. This translated into meaningful commercial wins with customers during the quarter, which speaks to the ongoing strength of our growth strategy and our ability to gain share now and in the future. I also visited China in August and spent time meeting with government officials and customers. We have strong relationships there based on our track record of positive impact and our long history in the country. Our conversations were focused on how we can collaborate to enable our customer success. I came away from the visit, seeing firsthand how well-positioned we are to capitalize on the market opportunities when the economy picks up in China. Let me now give you an example from the third quarter and how we advanced customer partnerships and collaborations. In our clinical next-gen sequencing business, we announced our partnership with the National Cancer Institute, myeloMATCH precision medicine umbrella trial. That's going to leverage our next-generation sequencing technology to test patients for specific biomarkers, so they can be matched more quickly with optimal treatments based on their unique cancer profiles. We also continue to expand our capabilities to meet our customers' current and future needs. To enhance our oral solid dose formulation capabilities for our pharma and biotech customers, we expanded our pharma services manufacturing footprint in Cincinnati, Ohio and Bend, Oregon. In our clinical research business, we announced the expansion of our global laboratory services network with a new bioanalytical lab in Gothenburg, Sweden, which will support pharmaceutical and biotech customers with advanced laboratory services to support all phases of development. So it was an excellent quarter of advancing our growth strategy. Let me give you a quick update on the impact of our PPI business system in Q3. PPI is embedded in our culture and there are many examples that I could share from the quarter. As always, our PPI business system and our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day to enable outstanding execution. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of PPI reflected in the strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the quarter. During the quarter, we further enhanced our supply chain in Asia-Pacific by optimizing inventory across our network. While in Europe, we further streamlined and automated our manufacturing processes for high-end analytical instruments to meet strong demand. Now let me turn to corporate social responsibility. We have a CSR strategy that delivers competitive advantage. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by the environment we create for our colleagues, how we support our communities and being a good steward of our planet. Today, I just want to spend a moment on our colleagues, because none of our success is possible without the work of our amazing team around the world. Our colleague safety is always our top priority and the impact of Hurricane Helene was especially concerning to me as we have about 1,000 colleagues in Asheville, North Carolina, one of the hardest hit areas. In Asheville, we manufacture lab equipment and have a customer service center. I'm so grateful our colleagues there are safe. I'm also thankful for the support of our extended teams, who have provided assistance to those colleagues impacted. It's truly heartwarming to see how our team comes together to support each other. Turning now to capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create tremendous value. We do this through a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Let me update you on our recent acquisitions. The Binding Site now our protein diagnostics business continues to perform exceptionally well. In the quarter, we achieved an IVDR claim extension in the European Union for our Optilite Freelight MX Kappa Kit. Until now, these kits have been solely used in multiple myeloma diagnostics and monitoring. The extension now allows for the product to aid in the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This is an excellent example of our M&A approach enabling a great business to be even better under our ownership, creating value for all stakeholders. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Olink at the beginning of the quarter. The integration is progressing smoothly. The business is well-positioned for a bright future. As you heard at our Investor Day, we're excited by the role we're playing in advancing proteomics research. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07 and we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our growth has been steadily increasing as we've gone through 2024 and we once again have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. And we're well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Good morning. So what I thought to do is maybe actually put some framing comments overall, then I'll get to your 2025 question as well. So for the Q&A session today, as I think about the third quarter as we sit here in October and how the year has progressed: first, it was a good quarter. And the market conditions, they've been in line with our expectations and they've been modestly improving as we progress through the year, which is what we expected to happen, so it's good that that's playing out that way. In Q3 for us, organic growth was flat. We were able to offset a three-point headwind from the runoff of COVID-19-related revenues. So it puts it in context of how we're performing. Each quarter, our organic growth has improved as the year has progressed. And I'm really quite excited by the fact that we're expecting the fourth quarter to return to growth organically, which is a good thing. Operationally, we're executing our proven growth strategy. We have strong financial management that's been able to allow us to increase our adjusted EPS guidance each quarter and kind of make all of this a non-event in terms of performance. So all of that is kind of the framing for the discussion today. So when I think about 2025 and I'll kind of -- just kind of boil it all together into sort of how do I think about the year. The first thing is, from our perspective, the best time to provide guidance is on our Q4 2024 call, which is in January. At that point, we're going to have the latest view of the market and the macro conditions and how ultimately we finish the year. And what we're going to approach it as the same as we did in 2024. We're going to give you our best thinking for the year ahead and then execute against it. From my own perspective and personally, I'm excited for 2025, right? And as I think about it in October, the end markets are modestly improving throughout the year. We're excited that in the fourth quarter, we're going to return to growth organically. For us in 2025, what I would say is that it's the final year of the runoff of the pandemic-related activity and while that'll still be a headwind to growth, it's going to be less than it was in 2024. And then I always think about how we're performing, right? And as a company, we're executing well. Our growth strategy is driving share gain. Our PPI Business System enables outstanding execution. We have a disciplined capital deployment strategy that generates returns. Our acquisitions are performing well. And we're going to be well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance once again in 2025. So we'll look forward to updating you on that in January as we have the best view of what the environment is. So you're going to get a lot of fan mail from your peers on this call, sort of asking each of all the questions within pharma and biotech. I'll take a high-level shot at it. So first, when I think about the third quarter and how things progressed, you're seeing a sequential improvement, which is good. And when I think about underlying performance, right? We obviously had a mid-single-digit headwind from the pandemic runoff. So you're seeing that the conditions continue to improve. In aggregate, obviously, they're somewhat muted, because they're below the long-term expectations for the market growth, right? So that's nothing surprising where the positives are sort of the data points as we sit here, confidence in biotech is improving, funding in biotech in the industry has been modestly improving as the year progresses. So, it's definitely meaningfully better than it was in 2023. And when I think about the large pharma, in a way, I think it's kind of normal distribution amongst the different companies, some doing extraordinarily well, others adjusting to how their pipelines are performing. And customers have been adjusting to the IRA, and you see that in a more muted growth environment, but we're obviously incredibly well positioned with this customer base and we're clearly delivering differentiated performance relative to others. So the trusted partner status, our unique value proposition, these things resonate. So we feel good about the long-term health of pharma and biotech and how we're performing this year. Thanks, Mike. So, Rachel, thanks for the question. Good morning. When I think about our clinical research business, actually it's performing well. When I think about the business delivered growth in the quarter, it obviously has a meaningful headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies of CRO-related activity. So from that perspective, I feel good about how we're doing. Next quarter, I'm going to really spend some time talking about the magic that we're unlocking on the combination between our pharma services and our clinical research business and how that really adds differentiated value for our customers in terms of performance. So I want to focus on that one. We just announced how we talk about that to our customers. We've been doing this for quite some time and it's really been quite spectacular. So our momentum with the customer base is quite good and we're executing well. When I think about the -- our position, we have a slightly larger position serving biotech more broadly than we do serving pharma within clinical research in terms of the mix of the business, but both customer sets are very important. And when I think about some of the highlights, the biotech customers more quickly adopt that unified set of capabilities, because it's easier for them just organizationally to leverage all of pulling everything together one. So you're seeing that in authorizations and momentum, and biotech is particularly moving in the right direction. So that's how we see it. In terms of the 25% and long-term 8%, all of these things, we don't -- as you know, we're going to give our views on '25 next year. And we don't go -- we don't guide down to the business unit performance within the company, but we'll give the puts and takes of what's growing faster and what's growing at the average and what's growing more slowly than the average when we get to the guidance next year. Yes, Rachel, thanks for the question, and thank you for the framing of the question. Because actually, the numbers are different than what seems to have been modeled in the analyst models, but actually, the business performed in line with our expectations for the quarter. So when I think about what happened in the quarter, in the third quarter, we had our largest impact of the COVID roll-off in this segment. That's something we knew, something -- that's why it came in line with our expectations relative to the other quarters. Q3 was the most difficult comparison in the COVID-related activities for us. So that probably explains a little bit of the modeling difference. In terms of how our business is performing, bioproduction is certainly the one that gets the most interest because there are a number of companies that are just bioproduction companies that have stocks out there. Actually, the quarter played out as we expected. It was nice to see strong momentum in orders, both sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue continues to progress in the right direction sequentially in terms of growth, and that obviously is going to be less of a headwind going forward and ultimately going to in not-distant future in terms of bioproduction, that's good. The only other commentary I would make on the LSS segment, it's not an enormous business, but our clinical sequencing business is doing really well, right? You see the announcements I talked about. One of them with the National Cancer Institute. You saw after the quarter-end, an announcement from one of our customers in terms of companion diagnostic approved using our sequencing for brain cancer. These are really positives in terms of customers applying our technology to make a huge difference on patient lives and the course of treatment, so that business is doing quite well. Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, Jack. Yes. So Jack, in terms of the growth, it was largely in line with what we expected to happen for the quarter. So from that perspective versus the external models, I always think there's a degree of accuracy between the Street and what we say we try to give as clear as we can on these calls about what our expectations are for the year and the upcoming quarter. And I think Stephen gave some very clear views again this quarter about the next one. So from our perspective, kind of, played out as we thought, in terms of the pacing through the quarter, largely as we expected, I would say, at the very, very end of the quarter, academic and government wasn't quite as strong as you normally would see. But like in the scale of our company, like a $10.5 billion-plus quarter, that's $10 million, $20 million. It's not a big number, but -- so I didn't really jump out any patterns of any significance in terms of how the month played out during the quarter. Thanks, Jack. So Doug, thanks for the question. So if we go back to January and we say -- we had a set of expectations for the year, and those expectations have really played out with an incredible degree of precision so far through the first nine months. First quarter on revenue was a little bit higher. The next two quarters were super tight around what we expected, and we're looking forward to the fourth quarter where we return to growth. And when you unpack the different businesses, there's actually not a lot there in terms of them also performing differently than what we expected. And I'll come back to that with a couple of added things. But -- so it was not like something is meaningfully different than what we thought in January, better or worse. The two things we did talk about, about what we could change the range for this year, was how would biotech perform in terms of funding and what would happen in China, right? And biotech is progressing in the right direction. Funding is improving, confidence is improving. As you know, there's a lag between funding and ultimately how that flows into our industry. So that's encouraging relative to what we saw certainly in the previous couple of years in that dimension. So that kind of helps you think a little bit about market conditions going forward. The second was China. China has not progressed, right? In terms of economic activity has been incredibly muted in terms of the environment. The government did announce two different types of stimulus programs, actually interesting. First, that affect our industry in a positive way, which is around the equipment stimulus and the loan program that they have for their customers or their institutions. And we expect that's largely a 2025 impact and beyond, so that's encouraging. And more recently, they actually announced stimulus programs to spur economic growth and business confidence and consumer confidence that actually would also be helpful for the long-term there. So that one is more on the come, right, because it hasn't -- the words have said, but in terms of the impact as to the economy, it hasn't seen. So that will be a swing factor going forward on how that plays out. And then it turns within our businesses, probably the only thing that I would really call out is it really is awesome to see the adoption of our high-end technologies and analytical insurance, right? It's just -- it's amazing how customers, even though it's obviously it's a muted environment in total, right? The industry is declining this year, and that's nothing of a surprise. That business is just getting great adoption for our technologies. And it was one of the cool things we said during the pandemic when we were just really driving great growth, because of our response, we reinvested in R&D, and that reinvestment has really led to differential performance in terms of how our technology has been adopted. So I'd call that out. Is that massively different than what we expected in January? No, but it's great to see, and it's a little bit better than what we expected. And the offsets to that are immaterial across the rest of the company. You want to start, Stephen? No, the channel is doing really well. Actually, both the health care market channel and the research and safety market channel continue to do well. They're delivering nice growth and actually winning some really nice customers, which bodes well for the future. So part of the commentary that I talked about, customer wins and those things in my remarks, really a number of our businesses. But in those comments are really around large wins and channel clearly had some nice ones during the quarter, which doesn't show up at all in revenue in the quarter that you win them, but over the coming quarters ahead, it really is quite a positive. You want to talk about price in aggregate... Yes, I'd say probably the pricing environment is back to normal. It's a good industry. Price goes up modestly each year. You have the dynamic inflation where price went up certainly more than what is usual and we're kind of back to the normal dynamic. In terms of our pharma services business, capacity expansions, as everyone knows, we've expanded our investments in sterile fill/finish capacity and have a number of lines that are coming online, if you will, during the course of 2025 and 2026 to support customer demand. So that's positive. That does put pressure on margins in the short term, because there's costs in training and getting the kind of the qualification process for the facilities. But certainly, as we get through 2025, you'll see higher levels of utilization on that capacity to support the strong growth in sterile fill/finish. And so that's the dynamic there. As I announced in my remarks, because of the specific capabilities of interest in oral solid dose, which is not our biggest part of our offering in drug products. We did do some capacity expansions in Bend, Oregon and Cincinnati, Ohio to meet the customer demand, which is good on the development side of the equation. So that's the dynamic there. Thanks, Tycho. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So when I think about analytical instruments, we had 3% organic growth in the quarter playing out as we expected. Obviously, innovation really matters. For us, we've been able to launch a number of products that have been adopted. Actually on the high-end, we talk about Iliad in this particular quarter, that bodes well to continue to drive momentum in electron microscopy obviously, Astral has done very well as you noted. Stellar, which we launched last quarter, the early interest is quite strong. So those things are going well. Innuvion, which is non- chromatography more of a midrange technology, very important in that particular category of chromatography, incredibly strong demand. So our innovation has been well adopted. When you take out all of those things, you just kind of say the routine capital equipment aspects of instruments, actually pretty muted conditions, right? Nothing is surprising. When we talk about for the full-year for the whole company, to have market down in the low-single-digits, you would expect capital equipment to have you the conditions they are. And a big driver of that, obviously, is China, which is, in instrument businesses for the whole industry, is a large portion of demand and obviously that market is most challenged. So exactly where we are in the replacement cycle for those things, I think it really varies by customer, by product type and all of that. And we didn't see any particular pattern that jumped out to indicate any change in trajectory. Yes. So Dan, probably when we think about pharma and biotech, right, it covers the full spectrum of activity. And one of the things that's within that is on production, you have the headwinds across the industry of bioproduction, right? So there's not like an R&D specific call out that you can derive from the numbers. We all understand the runoff on the pandemic is largely in the clinical research side and largely in the bioproduction and pharma services side. So that's a little bit of what's muting the growth in total for our industry. In terms of the dialogue that I've had with customers and sort of what's the tone? People are super excited about the pipeline, right? Whether it's the fact of the GLP-1s and the scale of a high-impact medicine that it just really is getting people excited. But there's really interesting work going on, on Alzheimer's, which is fantastic. And you've seen some interesting approvals in other neurological diseases that there's just a lot of excitement about pipelines and opportunities. And so I believe that the data you're quoting about the R&D investment is looking good, it reflects that customers have optimism for the future. And ultimately, that's going to translate into our space. So which is why we're so confident about the long-term prospects for our industry. Dan, thanks. So when I think about China and I think about stimulus, certainly a discussion I had when I was meeting with government officials and certainly with customers as well, really, activity has been around applying for the funding, right, and going through that process. So there's quite a bit of that activity. So I'm not sure that trade is something else off, but it might have. Like I don't know, like, none of the customers specifically mentioned it, but I didn't ask the question that way. I was much more interested about how are they tapping into the available new funds and how are they thinking about it, and there seems to be optimism and enthusiasm for the upcoming investments. So I think stimulus will be a 2025 activity, maybe a little bit in Q4, probably not all that significant, but -- so that's how I think about what's going on in China. The other thing from the China trip that I came away with -- and obviously, I knew it going in, but we are incredibly well positioned in the country. I mean we have deep relationships with our customers, very strong earned relationships with government. Being a scale player for 40-years in the country and supporting their response to the pandemic, various crises in the past, just a good local participant to help society out there, we benefit from that. And we're well positioned to help our customers, and we have great discussions about customer dialogue with where can we collaborate, and how can we help them, have the Chinese population be healthier through our technology business. So I think as the economy improves there, we're going to be well positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you for the questions today. Let me just make a quick closing comment. And it's good to have another strong quarter behind us. And we're very well positioned to deliver differentiated performance into 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and to build an even brighter future for our company. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full year performance in our January call. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\nRafael Tejada: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until August 7, 2024. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2024 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading financials.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2024 earnings and also in the investor section of our website under the heading financials. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Casper: Raf, thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had great results for the quarter. We're making excellent progress to deliver differentiated results for the year. I'm proud of our team as they executed at a very high level to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. This continued success is a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.54 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.35 billion. Adjusted operating margin increased in Q2 to 22.3%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 4% increase year-over-year to $5.37 per share. Our performance in the second quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance once again and continue our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market, in the second quarter, underlying mark conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution drove share gain in the quarter, and we delivered a sequential improvement in growth in all four of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 4 point headwind for this customer segment. Performance in the second quarter was led by our biosciences and clinical research businesses. In academic and government and in industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. In both these end markets, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined in the low-single-digits. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good core revenue growth highlighted by our transplant diagnostic and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-day basis, I feel very good about the progress we've made at the halfway point of the year. Our end markets are playing out as we expected, and our team's execution has been excellent. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars. High impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter of innovation as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses. I'll begin with the new technologies we launched at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, further strengthening our industry leading position in analytical instruments. At the conference, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer, which extends our leadership in proteomics. The Thermo Scientific Stellar is used to validate biomarker candidates. It offers unprecedented analytical capabilities for targeted quantitation, enabling the insights needed by researchers to advance their work. It's a perfect complement to our groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral, used for protein discovery that we launched last year. It was incredibly exciting to hear the customer testimonials sharing the power of the Orbitrap Astral. To-date, we've had more than 40 publications that incorporated the impact of this breakthrough, and we're really just getting started. Also at ASMS, we launched three new build-for-purpose editions of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid Mass Spectrometer tailored to specific applications for MultiOmics, Structural Biology and BioPharma. These instruments continue to elevate our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio by offering enhanced speed and sensitivity to detect and characterize the most difficult protein samples, including complex biologics. This quarter we also launched products to help our customers meet their own sustainability goals. In our bioproduction business, we introduced a first of its kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies. These new bioprocess containers use plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials to provide lower carbon solutions for the manufacturer of biologics. And in our laboratory products business, we launched a new line of Energy Star certified Thermo Scientific TSX universal series ULT freezers that deliver industry-leading performance and energy efficiency to help labs meet their sustainability goals. Turning to the highlights of our second and third pillars of our growth strategy, during the quarter we continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we've learned with our customers. Our customers rely on us to help accelerate their innovation, increase their productivity, and advance their important work. I spent a lot of time connecting with customers to understand their near and long-term priorities, so that we can enable their success. As a result of these unique relationships, we continue to advance our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. Let me give you a couple of examples from the second quarter. We expanded our leading clinical trial supply services with a new ultra-cold facility in Bleiswijk in the Netherlands to offer pharma and biotech customers tailored end-to-end support throughout the clinical supply chain for high-value therapies, including cell and gene therapies, biologics, antibodies, and vaccines. We also opened a state-of-the-art innovation lab at our site in Center Valley, Pennsylvania to showcase our innovative solutions for global clinical trial supply, including new packaging solutions, real-time tracking and tracing, and enhanced clinical trial setup and planning. In addition, we advance partnerships and collaborations with our customers during the quarter. Let me give you a couple of examples in the Asia Pacific region. To support Indonesia's growing investments in healthcare, scientific research, and renewable energy, we further expanded our presence and capabilities in the country. We are collaborating with the National Battery Research Institute to advance battery technology and energy storage, as well as with the Mandaya Hospital Group to help advance stem cell research and cell therapy development. In Singapore, we announced a collaboration with the National University Hospital in Mirxes, a local RNA technology company to develop and clinically validate advanced next generation sequencing genomic testing solutions specifically made to address the needs of the Southeast Asian population. So another strong quarter of executing our growth strategy. Let me now turn to our PPI business system, which enabled excellent execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to see the PPI efforts to further improve manufacturing of our lab equipment products, and I came away incredibly impressed with the progress to drive operational efficiency in this business. It's also great to see how PPI has been adopted in our clinical research business where it is driving meaningful improvements in our efficiency and customer allegiance. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of our PPI business system and our Q2 results reflected in strong profitability and cashflow that we delivered in the quarter. We also advanced our corporate social responsibility priorities during the quarter. As a mission driven company, we helped to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. We continue to make progress on our environmental sustainability roadmap in Q2. As part of our commitment to safeguarding the world's natural resources, we have set targets for 2025, which include zero waste certification for 30 manufacturing and warehouse sites. During the quarter, three more of our sites achieve zero waste certification, and we're on track to achieve our goals. You can learn much more about our progress in our 2023 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which was published during the quarter. The report provides a transparent account of our journey as we fulfill our commitments to society and all of our stakeholders. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Shortly after the quarter ended, we completed our acquisition of Olink, and it was great to welcome our new colleagues to the company earlier this month. As you know, Olink is a leading provider of next generation proteomic solutions. The addition of Olink\u2019s proven and transformative technology is highly complementary to our industry leading mass spectrometers. Olink further advances our leadership as it is a great addition to our differentiated protein research ecosystem. Our world-class commercial engine will enable us to bring this technology to scientists around the world. By increasing the use of next-gen proteomics and providing industry-leading data quality at scale, excuse me, data quality at scale, we're in a great position to further enhance the understanding of human biology and meaningfully accelerate scientific breakthroughs. So as I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our team accomplished and grateful to their contributions for our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, we're raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our strong results in Q2 allowed us to raise our guidance again for the year. We're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high level view on how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As Mark mentioned in the quarter, market conditions were as we'd expected, yet another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q2 financials ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance. Starting with the top line, core organic revenue growth was a little over 0.5 percentage point ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. That translates to approximately $60 million of revenue, which is partially offset by slightly higher FX revenue headwind. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.25 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. $0.08 was from strong operational performance; $0.06 cents was from favorable effects and timing of discrete tax planning benefits within the year; and $0.11 was from the beat -- was from lower net interest expense. In my prior guidance I took a prudent approach to the Olink transaction from a financing cost standpoint. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. The year-to-date free cash flow is 68% higher than the same period last year. So we're continuing to deliver strong performance and we're well positioned at the halfway point of the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q2. Beginning with the earnings per share. In the quarter adjusted EPS grew by 4% to $5.37. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.04, up 15% from Q2 last year. On the top line, in Q2 reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 report of revenue change included 1% lower organic revenue, a 1% headwind from foreign exchange, and a slight contribution from acquisitions. We delivered another strong sequential improvement in core organic revenue growth this quarter. And in Q2, core organic revenue growth rounded up to flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $115 million, this was mainly from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q2 North America declined mid-single-digits, Europe grew low-single-digits, and Asia Pacific grew mid-single-digits, which includes China, which also grew mid-single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 10 basis points higher than Q2 last year and 30 basis points higher than Q1 2024. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42.1%, 110 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we continue to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, as well as the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of low volumes, while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving on to the details of P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.6% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $340 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q2 net interest expense was $59 million, which is $89 million lower than Q2 2023, due to higher cash and investment balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. And average diluted shares were 383 million in Q2, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $2.6 billion after investing $630 million of net capital expenditures. We enter the quarter with $8.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.4 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance suggested ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with life sciences solutions. Q2 reported revenue in the segment declined 4% and organic revenue was 3% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was led by a biosciences business that was more than offset by the impact of the pandemic. Q2 adjusted operating income for life science solutions increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 36.7%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially upset by unfavorable volume pull through. The team continued to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the analytical instrument segment, reported revenue grew 2% and organic growth was 3% higher than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver a very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 24.6%, 10 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 both reported and organic revenue were 1% higher than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses, as well as in our healthcare market channel. Q2 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which was flat, compared to Q2 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was offset by strategic investment. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q2 versus the prior year quarter. This is driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. Growth in this segment in Q2 was led by a clinical research business. Q2 adjusted operating income declined 10% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, which is 120 basis points lower than Q2 2023, flat sequentially to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Mark outlined, given our strong performance in Q2, we're raising our 2024 full-year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07. The improved revenue guidance does not change the core organic revenue growth rounding for the year, so we still continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. And we continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system execution will enable us to continue to take share once again. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%, slightly higher than the prior guide. Our PPI business system is continuing to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. We now expect net interest costs to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million for the year. And the raise to our adjusted EPS guidance range reflects a $0.15 increase on the low end and a $0.05 increase on the high end, which results in an increase in the midpoint by $0.10. So another strong quarter of execution, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year, we remain really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenues. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, or 3% of revenue. We assume that FX would be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS, and we're assuming that the $0.03 FX adjusted EPS beat that we saw in Q2 is offset for the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus the prior guidance. We continue to expect adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024, and for the year we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. Expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink shortly after the Q2 close. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing to help you with your modeling. Relative to the midpoint of the guide, I recommend modeling Q3 organic revenue growth 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. Also good to model core organic revenue growth in Q3 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. And in terms of adjusted EPS in Q3, I recommend modeling it to be just over 24% of the full-year. So to conclude, we continue to deliver on our commitments. And at the halfway point, we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024. With that I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\nRafael Tejada: Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, a high-level one for you to start off maybe, at our Vegas Health Care Conference in May, you made some initial comments about 2025 market expectations. And you said that you expect the tools market next year would be just below the 4 to 6 level it has historically been. Just given the way the year is playing out, how you're exiting 2024, entering 2025. It's been a couple months since then. You've got hopefully a clearer view of how 2024 is going to play out. So given where you sit now, do you have more confidence in that 2025 market assumption and maybe how Thermal can deliver differentiated performance above that?\nMarc Casper: Mike, thanks for the question. It was a pleasure to be in with you earlier in the quarter. So let me start actually one level off. Just kind of frame a few of my general thoughts and I'll talk about 2025. So when I think about Q2, team executed really well, really good financial performance. It was ahead of our expectations. It allowed us to raise our guidance. The other aspect of the performance is the actual performance as opposed to relative to expectations. Clearly very differentiated and very strong. It was good to see that core has now elevated to it's now flat, which is great. 4% adjusted EPS growth and expansion of margins. So I feel very good about the performance and when I think about the market they were in line with our expectations, so it's good to see the visibility that we've enjoyed for decades, as returned in terms of how the market's playing out. And when I think about our own performance within the markets, it was good to see that all four of our markets, we had sequential improvement in our growth across all four. So really very positive development. PPI business system is really delivering outstanding impact and ultimately feel good about the performance. Capital deployment has been active and good. We've deployed over $6 billion of capital through the first-half of the year, half of it on return of capital and half of it on a very exciting acquisition of Olink, and we're very well positioned at this point to deliver strong results. When I think about 2025, I think the way I would just think about it is we're going give you that in January of 2025. When we have the benefit of the year behind us and we're focused on delivering a great year, we'll be able to give you a view of not only our performance, but how we saw the underlying market conditions. The year is progressing as we expected, so we expect that the market will continue to improve modestly in the back half of the year, each quarter being a little better than the quarter before and that our performance will also continue to step up and that will give us momentum going at \u201825 in the details. We'll give you back -- we'll give you in a few months\u2019 time.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, fair enough. And then for my follow-up, I want to focus on China, I think if I heard correctly, you called out that it grew mid-single-digits in the quarter. I want to make sure I heard that right. But if so, that's a bit surprising. Anything you could say in terms of what you're seeing there? Is that also ahead of your expectations and is this just a temporary bump in the quarter or something one-timey or are you seeing some real traction here and you think that can get you into your end? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes, your hearing is excellent. So yes, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Team did a nice job, really good execution. Comparison was relatively easy in the quarter, so and I would still characterize the conditions as muted in terms of the environment, but a nice job by the team to deliver a very solid Q2 result. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Jack Meehan. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to start by asking about LSS, so this had some nice sequential improvement in the growth rate. I heard biosciences led to growth. Can you talk about the relative improvement you're seeing there, or also genetic sciences and bioprocessing? And any updates on where you think your customers stand in terms of e-stock?\nMarc Casper: Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about probably the most important points on our life science solutions segment, nice to see the growth in our biosciences business, that's every lab every day, really nice adoption in the pharma and biotech segment there. So that was a nice positive development in terms of there. And maybe I'll dive a little bit into bioproduction, which is always an area of great interest to our investors. The business is actually progressing really exactly as we expected, really nice quarter of performance. So when I think about the most salient facts around bioproduction, sequentially really nice revenue growth in Q2. When I look at orders, we had really nice sequential growth in orders. We had year-over-year growth in orders, and we had a favorable book-to-bill. So progressing well, and when I look at others that have reported I feel very good about our performance. So when I think about the life science solution segment those are two of the drivers and then you've seen some announcements in the previous few months about important companion diagnostics our clinical sequence business -- clinical sequencing business is doing quite well. So Jack thanks for the question on LSS.\nJack Meehan: Excellent okay and then one to rotate to AI, so this also came in a bit better than I was expecting. Can you talk about how the book-to-bill was in the segment in the quarter? And just update some customer spending patterns? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: Yes. So when I think about Analytical Instruments, it was nice to see the 3% growth in the quarter and very positive. Yes, I would say the market conditions also are playing out pretty much as we expected and not at the normal levels yet, and we certainly see the impact of the muted conditions in China. We have really excellent momentum in those differentiated products that we have where innovation matters, on orders as well as on revenue. When you look at electron microscopy, you look at the Orbitrap Astral, just the cutting-edge work, you've seen incredibly strong momentum there. So that's where the highlights are, and I would say in the more routine-ish aspects of the portfolio, you see more muted conditions. Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Hi, good morning, you guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Wanted to follow-up on some of the China comments. You mentioned that China grew mid-single-digits, partly due to the comp there. Can you just walk us through what are you seeing from China stimulus? We heard that this first tranche of funding was released earlier this quarter. So have you seen any orders related to China stimulus? Do you think that you'll benefit from this first tranche? And then also, have you seen any customers holding back spending related to the stimulus program? Kind of getting at this like air pocket that we've heard some of your peers talk about. Any comments there would be helpful.\nMarc Casper: Rachel, thanks for the question. It's an important question. So let me start at the sort of high level and then get down to the stimulus and then try to as much transparency as I possibly can. First of all, I think the world was surprised at how weak China was economically as this year unfolded. The stimulus programs announced early in the year was a sign that the government wanted to get the economy going, which is a good thing, right, in terms of sort of what is the macro backdrop in terms of a tough economic environment. When I think about stimulus in our industry and what we're seeing, tremendous amount of activity with our customers actually to help them with figuring out what to apply for. And so we know there's quite a bit of interest in our products from a stimulus perspective, and we're helping our customers in that process. When I think about how do I expect it to play out, my expectation is that it's largely going to show up in revenue in 2025 and likely to have some small effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. I did ask the question about air pocket to the team, and I'm actually heading off to China in a couple of weeks' time, so I'm looking forward to that. Our team didn't highlight any air pocket or anything like that. So it's kind of muted conditions, and customers are working on looking at the investments associated with the additional government funding. So we didn't see any pauses in the activity, and I'm proud of the team's mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then just as my follow-up here. On the CRO, you called out clinical research was an outperformer this quarter that drove some of the growth. So we've seen a few volatile prints from your peers. So can you walk us through what have you seen from an RFP standpoint and book-to-bill in the quarter for PPD? And then have we turned the quarter on emerging biotech funding and kind of how is that flowing through the model as well?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Rachel, team has done a really nice job executing very well in our clinical research business. And when I think about our performance, we delivered positive organic revenue growth despite a really substantial headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies in that activity. So team is doing a nice job. Commercial execution was very strong in the quarter, right? And customers value our capabilities. And when I sort of went under the details of the commercial performance and looked at some of the underlying trends, it was very clear that in Q2, we really did see some of the biotech funding activity that we talked about is a green shoot in Q1 that would give us confidence that the year in aggregate across our business would be improving from a market perspective. We saw that in Q2 actually translate into an acceleration of authorizations in our biotech customer base. And that really does bode well for that. And as you know well this business, that really translates more into revenue in \u201825 and \u201826 in terms of how long it takes to get the clinical trials up and going, but the authorization momentum very encouraging in the quarter. Thank you, Rachel.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, thank you and good morning everybody. Marc, when we look at two-year stacks and calculate CAGRs going back pre-pandemic, it seems like most business lines within Thermo continue to trend positively. I think your commentary is consistent with that on the call this morning. With that in mind, I think one of the key questions is, what's going to be the pace of improvement from here? So with that in mind, two questions. First, where is the recovery occurring more quickly than you may have expected? Where are things lagging? And I'm kind of thinking about this both in terms of how you guided for the year, but also just based on what you've seen through previous cycles. So that's one question. And then the second would be just keeping in mind your assumption that this market grows 4% to 6% on a normalized basis, is it fair to assume that recognizing you're making progress here, but just seeing what the pacing is, is it fair to assume that the move back into that range is going to be gradual versus a snapback? And essentially that this move into the 4% to 6% range, it's going to take several quarters?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Doug, there's a lot in that question. It's a good question. So let me just start with I think the things that are around the market and our performance which is important to our investors, right? Pre-2023, holding aside some of the amazing market and our performance in the pandemic period, a very predictable, visible market without a lot of volatility and really a great underlying set of growth, right? So there's never debates about market growth sort of pre-pandemic or even in the early parts of the pandemic. So -- and then obviously, a difficult year for the industry in 2023, comparisons and a lot of other factors related to the pandemic directly and indirectly. So when I think about what we're seeing in the industry now for three quarters in a row, the visibility is pretty good. Like we have a good feel for what's going on. It's playing out as we expected. There's always things a little better, a little worse, also irrelevant on the margin. They're all in the factor of the aggregate, so I feel very good about the progression. What's embedded in our guidance in the market, right, is that for the full-year is that it continues to step up a little bit more in Q3 and further in Q4. And when I think about what we've assumed in the market growth and back in the January time frame when we gave our guidance is we said the market was going to be down low-single-digits. But when you looked at sort of the phasing implied, it probably is flattish, maybe up slightly in the fourth quarter in terms of the market progression. That's -- we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but that's sort of what's implied in there. And so it's progressing well. When I think to how it's going to progress exactly each quarter thereafter, when we get to January, I will have a much better feel for it. But I think what's really relevant is how do I feel about the 4% to 6%, right? And I'm looking forward to Investor Day. I feel great about the long-term 4% to 6%. That doesn't mean I can predict it to a quarter or the specific year, but when talking a three to five-year time frame, and do I believe that the market growth is going to be 4% to 6%, 100% confidence in that. But underlying scientific drivers are phenomenal in terms of our industry, what's going on in pipelines, our customer base, fantastic, right? So I don't lose any sleep over that. And I always question it because it's important. It's not like just take it from a dramatic standpoint, but from a fact and underlying drivers, I feel great about it. And then the other thing that's important to me, important to our 125,000 colleagues and actually quite important to our investors is our customers meaningfully choosing us more often than their other choices. And the ability to grow 2% faster than the market, I feel great about. And we have an incredible track record this quarter, at least looking at what we've seen so far, once again delivered on that. So hopefully, that puts it in the context of my enthusiasm. And we'll provide you transparency as the year wraps up to what do we see as a reasonable assumption for the next year. And I think our forecast accuracy is pretty good.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. And Marc, if I can ask one more high-level follow-up. Over the years and in working with you and following Thermo, one of the neat things has been in these tougher periods in the market, Thermo and you specifically have -- you've played offense when others have played defense. Recognizing every cycle is difficult and different, I would say the last 1.5 years has been maybe tougher than normal even for Thermo. As things start to improve a little bit, but again, it's gradual, do you feel you're in a position now to maybe get even more aggressive like you have in previous cycles when it comes to capital deployment, evolving the business and other initiatives? Are you feeling more comfortable, more confident in making those moves that we've seen in prior cycles? Thank you.\nMarc Casper: Doug, thanks for the question. When I think about the company's strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers over many, many years, we're able to take a long-term perspective, while holding ourselves accountable for delivering excellent long-term results. And I love periods where not everybody is performing at the same level. It creates opportunities. I loved during the fact that the pandemic, we were able to accelerate our investments in innovation. Well, I mean I talked probably for five of my 15 minutes today on innovation. And I had to truncate it because the list was so long. It is super cool. And our job is to differentiate our competitive position to deliver superior organic growth to the others and translate into great results. And I'm very excited about our ability to continue to do that and further differentiate our industry leadership going forward. So thanks for the question, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson. Tyco, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. Hey, Marc, a question on operating margins or maybe for Stephen. Lab products and services, obviously, you felt the headwinds from the vaccine and therapy roll off, but it was effectively at a two-year low. So just curious about how you think about margin for lab products going forward? And then as we think about 2025, if TPD and Patheon can grow above the corporate average, do you still have the ability to drive 40 to 50 bps of margin expansion or potentially could be higher or lower? Thanks.\nStephen Williamson: Tycho, thanks for the question, and good to hear from you again. So in terms of the margin profile in the quarter, we're going through largely the impact of the transition of the vaccine-related capacity in sterile fill finish and translating into other modalities. So that's probably the biggest factor that you see there. And I think about the margin profile for our businesses, I feel good about the ability to drive strong margin expansion as we -- the top line growth comes back in certain parts of the business where we've appropriately adjusted the cost base down and where volumes have come down. And as those volumes come back, we're going to get some good pull-through that comes from that. So look forward to giving the details on '25 when we get to the January call. But yes, in terms of the margin profile and kind of the mix of business, I feel good about the ability to expand our margins.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then one follow-up on CDMO capacity. You doubled fill finish over the last couple of years. Just curious, Marc, how you think about additional capacity expansion, how you think about capacity utilization in the industry and how actively you may look at some of the capacity that could get freed up from some of the recent M&A or potentially around biosecure in the U.S?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Tycho, when I think about our pharma services business and our capacity, where we play, I feel very good about our position. We've had very strong demand for our sterile fill finish abilities, which is our largest activity, and we're doing well there. We've been expanding the number of lines we have at our sites, and demand has been strong for that. So I feel good about that outlook. In the clinical trials, supplies, which is the other really large portion of our business and where we really have an unparalleled position, I highlighted a couple of examples of capabilities we're expanding. Effectively, we make sure that our capacity lines up with our forecasted demand. So it's not really an overcapacity viewpoint. And then on the other parts of the business, I feel okay about our position and nothing of note there. So that's pretty positive. And what we're going through right now, as a reminder, is we're transitioning a lot of the COVID-related activities to the normal therapies. And the team is doing a good job. It certainly impacts our growth in terms of headwind in 2024, but it becomes better in '25 and '26 as the new therapies and the tech transfers are complete and new lines come on place. So pretty good times ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks, I appreciate the color.\nMarc Casper: Thanks, Tyco.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, thanks Marc and Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. So Marc, a higher-level question for you, maybe with your -- when you have conversations, the C-suite conversation with therapeutics teams out there, what are you seeing and hearing from your larger biopharma customers, and maybe to some extent, these mid-cap ones as well versus the smaller and earlier-stage customers? How much of a divergence are you seeing within these groups? And when can that divergence narrow?\nMarc Casper: Yes. So Puneet, thanks for the question. So when I think about the things that jump out to me the patterns, if you will, and I see lots of customers, and I'm looking forward to being back on the road tomorrow, seeing our customers is a great thing. In our larger customers, which -- and these will be the companies with many products that are both commercial and in their pipeline, you're seeing a few things. One, they're focused on resiliency of their supply chain. So where maybe historically pre-pandemic, they would have had single site in-house manufacturing, you're seeing much more of the second site, leveraging our capabilities. And that's great in terms of just making sure that they can meet their customer demand, if you will, for medicines. You're also seeing the desire for how do we help them be more innovative and productive. And you basically fund all of the exciting things in their pipeline by just helping them really prioritize the most important work and do that in the most effective way. So it's really about helping them do more to maximize the impact of what's in their pipeline. When I think about the smaller customers, because we had gone through a period in 2023 where funding was challenged, right, a lot of the tone was around how do they get through the period. When I think about the first six months of dialogue, much higher confidence, right? Funding is happening, but also the confidence that funding will be available really at a very different spot. And you're seeing that really translate into the earliest indicators of that, which is authorizations of new clinical trials and new activity. But I would expect that, that would sort of flow through the rest of the types of work we do as the year continues to unfold and as we get into '25. So I think that's a very positive development.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Great. And just a follow-up for Stephen. On the EPS beat, it was about $0.25 at the midpoint and -- but you raised the guide only by $0.10. So just wondering how much of that is a reflection of the end market versus what's within your control in terms of cost management? Or is there anything specific that you would point out to?\nStephen Williamson: Yes. So Puneet, so $0.06 of the beating in Q2 is really timing-related. When I think about the FX rates and kind of the outlook for the rest of the year, $0.03 of that $0.06 could be offset in the second-half. And then from a tax standpoint, we're not assuming the change in the overall rate for the year. That's timing with that. So that $0.06 is good beat in Q2, but it's net neutral for the year as a whole. And then with the rest, we've raised the low end $0.15, and we raised at the high end $0.05. And I think that's a strong raise at this point and think it's appropriate and enables us to be better positioned for the second half of the year. And I wouldn't really read anything else into that. It's just -- I think that's just appropriate at this point.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nRafael Tejada: Operator we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, Our next question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Arias: Good morning, guys. Marc, where do you think the academic markets are headed here? Some mixed data points there, and AH budget isn't particularly robust this year. So curious what expectations we should have for the second half and then into the next cycle.\nMarc Casper: Yes. I was encouraged by what I saw in academic and government in Q2. We had low single-digit growth, a relatively challenging comparison. So the team did a good job. What I'm seeing is on the high-end differentiated products, customers are getting money. I mean if I think through, consumers get money for the really great innovation. And given our track record on innovation, we're seeing strong demand for the Orbitrap Astral. And I know that there's a lot of excitement around the Thermo Scientific Stellar mass spectrometer and the eclipse series. These are really -- or series. These are really, really positive developments. And so I think it's good. I always think long-term academic and government globally, it was kind of a low-single-digit growth market, sometimes a little better than that. And for -- our performance is playing out in line with that right now.\nDan Arias: Okay. And then if I -- just as a follow-up on your comments on China stimulus and the ability to see money gets spent there. Do you see that as primarily just a function of time, customers need time to have it flow and get to them? Or are there sort of discrete triggers and specific things that need to happen in order to have demand to actually make its way to you? Thanks.\nMarc Casper: I mean the process is they have to apply, and there's a central government funding and matched by their other funding sources, usually provincial or it could be local depending on the institution. So they're going through that process. As it gets approved, they then have the ability to go out and place the order, so that's the view. I think because these institutions are funded by the government in all times, whether it's stimulus or not, I think they have a mechanism to understand what's likely to happen. So this is not giant mystery to them. I think they're working through it and is kind of normal from that perspective. And what we're doing is reminding them of the importance of the important instrumentation that we've launched and the relevance of it. So that they prioritize their funding request to support our instrumentation. Dan, thanks for the question, and I'll turn to just wrapping up. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, and we'll build an even brighter future for our company. We're looking forward to talking about that bright future at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19 in New York and updating you on our third quarter performance in October. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nOperator: Thank you very much. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high level view on how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As Mark mentioned in the quarter, market conditions were as we'd expected, yet another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q2 financials ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance. Starting with the top line, core organic revenue growth was a little over 0.5 percentage point ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. That translates to approximately $60 million of revenue, which is partially offset by slightly higher FX revenue headwind. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.25 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. $0.08 was from strong operational performance; $0.06 cents was from favorable effects and timing of discrete tax planning benefits within the year; and $0.11 was from the beat -- was from lower net interest expense. In my prior guidance I took a prudent approach to the Olink transaction from a financing cost standpoint. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. The year-to-date free cash flow is 68% higher than the same period last year. So we're continuing to deliver strong performance and we're well positioned at the halfway point of the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q2. Beginning with the earnings per share. In the quarter adjusted EPS grew by 4% to $5.37. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.04, up 15% from Q2 last year. On the top line, in Q2 reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 report of revenue change included 1% lower organic revenue, a 1% headwind from foreign exchange, and a slight contribution from acquisitions. We delivered another strong sequential improvement in core organic revenue growth this quarter. And in Q2, core organic revenue growth rounded up to flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $115 million, this was mainly from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q2 North America declined mid-single-digits, Europe grew low-single-digits, and Asia Pacific grew mid-single-digits, which includes China, which also grew mid-single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 10 basis points higher than Q2 last year and 30 basis points higher than Q1 2024. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42.1%, 110 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we continue to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, as well as the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of low volumes, while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving on to the details of P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.6% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $340 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q2 net interest expense was $59 million, which is $89 million lower than Q2 2023, due to higher cash and investment balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. And average diluted shares were 383 million in Q2, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $2.6 billion after investing $630 million of net capital expenditures. We enter the quarter with $8.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.4 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance suggested ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with life sciences solutions. Q2 reported revenue in the segment declined 4% and organic revenue was 3% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was led by a biosciences business that was more than offset by the impact of the pandemic. Q2 adjusted operating income for life science solutions increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 36.7%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially upset by unfavorable volume pull through. The team continued to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the analytical instrument segment, reported revenue grew 2% and organic growth was 3% higher than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver a very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 24.6%, 10 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 both reported and organic revenue were 1% higher than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses, as well as in our healthcare market channel. Q2 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which was flat, compared to Q2 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was offset by strategic investment. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q2 versus the prior year quarter. This is driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. Growth in this segment in Q2 was led by a clinical research business. Q2 adjusted operating income declined 10% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, which is 120 basis points lower than Q2 2023, flat sequentially to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Mark outlined, given our strong performance in Q2, we're raising our 2024 full-year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07. The improved revenue guidance does not change the core organic revenue growth rounding for the year, so we still continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. And we continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system execution will enable us to continue to take share once again. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%, slightly higher than the prior guide. Our PPI business system is continuing to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. We now expect net interest costs to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million for the year. And the raise to our adjusted EPS guidance range reflects a $0.15 increase on the low end and a $0.05 increase on the high end, which results in an increase in the midpoint by $0.10. So another strong quarter of execution, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year, we remain really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenues. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, or 3% of revenue. We assume that FX would be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS, and we're assuming that the $0.03 FX adjusted EPS beat that we saw in Q2 is offset for the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus the prior guidance. We continue to expect adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024, and for the year we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. Expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink shortly after the Q2 close. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing to help you with your modeling. Relative to the midpoint of the guide, I recommend modeling Q3 organic revenue growth 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. Also good to model core organic revenue growth in Q3 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. And in terms of adjusted EPS in Q3, I recommend modeling it to be just over 24% of the full-year. So to conclude, we continue to deliver on our commitments. And at the halfway point, we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024. With that I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Tycho, thanks for the question, and good to hear from you again. So in terms of the margin profile in the quarter, we're going through largely the impact of the transition of the vaccine-related capacity in sterile fill finish and translating into other modalities. So that's probably the biggest factor that you see there. And I think about the margin profile for our businesses, I feel good about the ability to drive strong margin expansion as we -- the top line growth comes back in certain parts of the business where we've appropriately adjusted the cost base down and where volumes have come down. And as those volumes come back, we're going to get some good pull-through that comes from that. So look forward to giving the details on '25 when we get to the January call. But yes, in terms of the margin profile and kind of the mix of business, I feel good about the ability to expand our margins. Yes. So Puneet, so $0.06 of the beating in Q2 is really timing-related. When I think about the FX rates and kind of the outlook for the rest of the year, $0.03 of that $0.06 could be offset in the second-half. And then from a tax standpoint, we're not assuming the change in the overall rate for the year. That's timing with that. So that $0.06 is good beat in Q2, but it's net neutral for the year as a whole. And then with the rest, we've raised the low end $0.15, and we raised at the high end $0.05. And I think that's a strong raise at this point and think it's appropriate and enables us to be better positioned for the second half of the year. And I wouldn't really read anything else into that. It's just -- I think that's just appropriate at this point."

            "content": "Raf, thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had great results for the quarter. We're making excellent progress to deliver differentiated results for the year. I'm proud of our team as they executed at a very high level to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. This continued success is a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.54 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.35 billion. Adjusted operating margin increased in Q2 to 22.3%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 4% increase year-over-year to $5.37 per share. Our performance in the second quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance once again and continue our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market, in the second quarter, underlying mark conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution drove share gain in the quarter, and we delivered a sequential improvement in growth in all four of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 4 point headwind for this customer segment. Performance in the second quarter was led by our biosciences and clinical research businesses. In academic and government and in industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. In both these end markets, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined in the low-single-digits. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good core revenue growth highlighted by our transplant diagnostic and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-day basis, I feel very good about the progress we've made at the halfway point of the year. Our end markets are playing out as we expected, and our team's execution has been excellent. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars. High impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter of innovation as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses. I'll begin with the new technologies we launched at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, further strengthening our industry leading position in analytical instruments. At the conference, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer, which extends our leadership in proteomics. The Thermo Scientific Stellar is used to validate biomarker candidates. It offers unprecedented analytical capabilities for targeted quantitation, enabling the insights needed by researchers to advance their work. It's a perfect complement to our groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral, used for protein discovery that we launched last year. It was incredibly exciting to hear the customer testimonials sharing the power of the Orbitrap Astral. To-date, we've had more than 40 publications that incorporated the impact of this breakthrough, and we're really just getting started. Also at ASMS, we launched three new build-for-purpose editions of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid Mass Spectrometer tailored to specific applications for MultiOmics, Structural Biology and BioPharma. These instruments continue to elevate our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio by offering enhanced speed and sensitivity to detect and characterize the most difficult protein samples, including complex biologics. This quarter we also launched products to help our customers meet their own sustainability goals. In our bioproduction business, we introduced a first of its kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies. These new bioprocess containers use plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials to provide lower carbon solutions for the manufacturer of biologics. And in our laboratory products business, we launched a new line of Energy Star certified Thermo Scientific TSX universal series ULT freezers that deliver industry-leading performance and energy efficiency to help labs meet their sustainability goals. Turning to the highlights of our second and third pillars of our growth strategy, during the quarter we continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we've learned with our customers. Our customers rely on us to help accelerate their innovation, increase their productivity, and advance their important work. I spent a lot of time connecting with customers to understand their near and long-term priorities, so that we can enable their success. As a result of these unique relationships, we continue to advance our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. Let me give you a couple of examples from the second quarter. We expanded our leading clinical trial supply services with a new ultra-cold facility in Bleiswijk in the Netherlands to offer pharma and biotech customers tailored end-to-end support throughout the clinical supply chain for high-value therapies, including cell and gene therapies, biologics, antibodies, and vaccines. We also opened a state-of-the-art innovation lab at our site in Center Valley, Pennsylvania to showcase our innovative solutions for global clinical trial supply, including new packaging solutions, real-time tracking and tracing, and enhanced clinical trial setup and planning. In addition, we advance partnerships and collaborations with our customers during the quarter. Let me give you a couple of examples in the Asia Pacific region. To support Indonesia's growing investments in healthcare, scientific research, and renewable energy, we further expanded our presence and capabilities in the country. We are collaborating with the National Battery Research Institute to advance battery technology and energy storage, as well as with the Mandaya Hospital Group to help advance stem cell research and cell therapy development. In Singapore, we announced a collaboration with the National University Hospital in Mirxes, a local RNA technology company to develop and clinically validate advanced next generation sequencing genomic testing solutions specifically made to address the needs of the Southeast Asian population. So another strong quarter of executing our growth strategy. Let me now turn to our PPI business system, which enabled excellent execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to see the PPI efforts to further improve manufacturing of our lab equipment products, and I came away incredibly impressed with the progress to drive operational efficiency in this business. It's also great to see how PPI has been adopted in our clinical research business where it is driving meaningful improvements in our efficiency and customer allegiance. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of our PPI business system and our Q2 results reflected in strong profitability and cashflow that we delivered in the quarter. We also advanced our corporate social responsibility priorities during the quarter. As a mission driven company, we helped to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. We continue to make progress on our environmental sustainability roadmap in Q2. As part of our commitment to safeguarding the world's natural resources, we have set targets for 2025, which include zero waste certification for 30 manufacturing and warehouse sites. During the quarter, three more of our sites achieve zero waste certification, and we're on track to achieve our goals. You can learn much more about our progress in our 2023 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which was published during the quarter. The report provides a transparent account of our journey as we fulfill our commitments to society and all of our stakeholders. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Shortly after the quarter ended, we completed our acquisition of Olink, and it was great to welcome our new colleagues to the company earlier this month. As you know, Olink is a leading provider of next generation proteomic solutions. The addition of Olink's proven and transformative technology is highly complementary to our industry leading mass spectrometers. Olink further advances our leadership as it is a great addition to our differentiated protein research ecosystem. Our world-class commercial engine will enable us to bring this technology to scientists around the world. By increasing the use of next-gen proteomics and providing industry-leading data quality at scale, excuse me, data quality at scale, we're in a great position to further enhance the understanding of human biology and meaningfully accelerate scientific breakthroughs. So as I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our team accomplished and grateful to their contributions for our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, we're raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our strong results in Q2 allowed us to raise our guidance again for the year. We're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Mike, thanks for the question. It was a pleasure to be in with you earlier in the quarter. So let me start actually one level off. Just kind of frame a few of my general thoughts and I'll talk about 2025. So when I think about Q2, team executed really well, really good financial performance. It was ahead of our expectations. It allowed us to raise our guidance. The other aspect of the performance is the actual performance as opposed to relative to expectations. Clearly very differentiated and very strong. It was good to see that core has now elevated to it's now flat, which is great. 4% adjusted EPS growth and expansion of margins. So I feel very good about the performance and when I think about the market they were in line with our expectations, so it's good to see the visibility that we've enjoyed for decades, as returned in terms of how the market's playing out. And when I think about our own performance within the markets, it was good to see that all four of our markets, we had sequential improvement in our growth across all four. So really very positive development. PPI business system is really delivering outstanding impact and ultimately feel good about the performance. Capital deployment has been active and good. We've deployed over $6 billion of capital through the first-half of the year, half of it on return of capital and half of it on a very exciting acquisition of Olink, and we're very well positioned at this point to deliver strong results. When I think about 2025, I think the way I would just think about it is we're going give you that in January of 2025. When we have the benefit of the year behind us and we're focused on delivering a great year, we'll be able to give you a view of not only our performance, but how we saw the underlying market conditions. The year is progressing as we expected, so we expect that the market will continue to improve modestly in the back half of the year, each quarter being a little better than the quarter before and that our performance will also continue to step up and that will give us momentum going at \u201825 in the details. We'll give you back -- we'll give you in a few months' time. Yes, your hearing is excellent. So yes, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Team did a nice job, really good execution. Comparison was relatively easy in the quarter, so and I would still characterize the conditions as muted in terms of the environment, but a nice job by the team to deliver a very solid Q2 result. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about probably the most important points on our life science solutions segment, nice to see the growth in our biosciences business, that's every lab every day, really nice adoption in the pharma and biotech segment there. So that was a nice positive development in terms of there. And maybe I'll dive a little bit into bioproduction, which is always an area of great interest to our investors. The business is actually progressing really exactly as we expected, really nice quarter of performance. So when I think about the most salient facts around bioproduction, sequentially really nice revenue growth in Q2. When I look at orders, we had really nice sequential growth in orders. We had year-over-year growth in orders, and we had a favorable book-to-bill. So progressing well, and when I look at others that have reported I feel very good about our performance. So when I think about the life science solution segment those are two of the drivers and then you've seen some announcements in the previous few months about important companion diagnostics our clinical sequence business -- clinical sequencing business is doing quite well. So Jack thanks for the question on LSS. Yes. So when I think about Analytical Instruments, it was nice to see the 3% growth in the quarter and very positive. Yes, I would say the market conditions also are playing out pretty much as we expected and not at the normal levels yet, and we certainly see the impact of the muted conditions in China. We have really excellent momentum in those differentiated products that we have where innovation matters, on orders as well as on revenue. When you look at electron microscopy, you look at the Orbitrap Astral, just the cutting-edge work, you've seen incredibly strong momentum there. So that's where the highlights are, and I would say in the more routine-ish aspects of the portfolio, you see more muted conditions. Thanks, Jack. Rachel, thanks for the question. It's an important question. So let me start at the sort of high level and then get down to the stimulus and then try to as much transparency as I possibly can. First of all, I think the world was surprised at how weak China was economically as this year unfolded. The stimulus programs announced early in the year was a sign that the government wanted to get the economy going, which is a good thing, right, in terms of sort of what is the macro backdrop in terms of a tough economic environment. When I think about stimulus in our industry and what we're seeing, tremendous amount of activity with our customers actually to help them with figuring out what to apply for. And so we know there's quite a bit of interest in our products from a stimulus perspective, and we're helping our customers in that process. When I think about how do I expect it to play out, my expectation is that it's largely going to show up in revenue in 2025 and likely to have some small effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. I did ask the question about air pocket to the team, and I'm actually heading off to China in a couple of weeks' time, so I'm looking forward to that. Our team didn't highlight any air pocket or anything like that. So it's kind of muted conditions, and customers are working on looking at the investments associated with the additional government funding. So we didn't see any pauses in the activity, and I'm proud of the team's mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Yes. So Rachel, team has done a really nice job executing very well in our clinical research business. And when I think about our performance, we delivered positive organic revenue growth despite a really substantial headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies in that activity. So team is doing a nice job. Commercial execution was very strong in the quarter, right? And customers value our capabilities. And when I sort of went under the details of the commercial performance and looked at some of the underlying trends, it was very clear that in Q2, we really did see some of the biotech funding activity that we talked about is a green shoot in Q1 that would give us confidence that the year in aggregate across our business would be improving from a market perspective. We saw that in Q2 actually translate into an acceleration of authorizations in our biotech customer base. And that really does bode well for that. And as you know well this business, that really translates more into revenue in \u201825 and \u201826 in terms of how long it takes to get the clinical trials up and going, but the authorization momentum very encouraging in the quarter. Thank you, Rachel. Yes. So Doug, there's a lot in that question. It's a good question. So let me just start with I think the things that are around the market and our performance which is important to our investors, right? Pre-2023, holding aside some of the amazing market and our performance in the pandemic period, a very predictable, visible market without a lot of volatility and really a great underlying set of growth, right? So there's never debates about market growth sort of pre-pandemic or even in the early parts of the pandemic. So -- and then obviously, a difficult year for the industry in 2023, comparisons and a lot of other factors related to the pandemic directly and indirectly. So when I think about what we're seeing in the industry now for three quarters in a row, the visibility is pretty good. Like we have a good feel for what's going on. It's playing out as we expected. There's always things a little better, a little worse, also irrelevant on the margin. They're all in the factor of the aggregate, so I feel very good about the progression. What's embedded in our guidance in the market, right, is that for the full-year is that it continues to step up a little bit more in Q3 and further in Q4. And when I think about what we've assumed in the market growth and back in the January time frame when we gave our guidance is we said the market was going to be down low-single-digits. But when you looked at sort of the phasing implied, it probably is flattish, maybe up slightly in the fourth quarter in terms of the market progression. That's -- we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but that's sort of what's implied in there. And so it's progressing well. When I think to how it's going to progress exactly each quarter thereafter, when we get to January, I will have a much better feel for it. But I think what's really relevant is how do I feel about the 4% to 6%, right? And I'm looking forward to Investor Day. I feel great about the long-term 4% to 6%. That doesn't mean I can predict it to a quarter or the specific year, but when talking a three to five-year time frame, and do I believe that the market growth is going to be 4% to 6%, 100% confidence in that. But underlying scientific drivers are phenomenal in terms of our industry, what's going on in pipelines, our customer base, fantastic, right? So I don't lose any sleep over that. And I always question it because it's important. It's not like just take it from a dramatic standpoint, but from a fact and underlying drivers, I feel great about it. And then the other thing that's important to me, important to our 125,000 colleagues and actually quite important to our investors is our customers meaningfully choosing us more often than their other choices. And the ability to grow 2% faster than the market, I feel great about. And we have an incredible track record this quarter, at least looking at what we've seen so far, once again delivered on that. So hopefully, that puts it in the context of my enthusiasm. And we'll provide you transparency as the year wraps up to what do we see as a reasonable assumption for the next year. And I think our forecast accuracy is pretty good. Doug, thanks for the question. When I think about the company's strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers over many, many years, we're able to take a long-term perspective, while holding ourselves accountable for delivering excellent long-term results. And I love periods where not everybody is performing at the same level. It creates opportunities. I loved during the fact that the pandemic, we were able to accelerate our investments in innovation. Well, I mean I talked probably for five of my 15 minutes today on innovation. And I had to truncate it because the list was so long. It is super cool. And our job is to differentiate our competitive position to deliver superior organic growth to the others and translate into great results. And I'm very excited about our ability to continue to do that and further differentiate our industry leadership going forward. So thanks for the question, Doug. Yes. So Tycho, when I think about our pharma services business and our capacity, where we play, I feel very good about our position. We've had very strong demand for our sterile fill finish abilities, which is our largest activity, and we're doing well there. We've been expanding the number of lines we have at our sites, and demand has been strong for that. So I feel good about that outlook. In the clinical trials, supplies, which is the other really large portion of our business and where we really have an unparalleled position, I highlighted a couple of examples of capabilities we're expanding. Effectively, we make sure that our capacity lines up with our forecasted demand. So it's not really an overcapacity viewpoint. And then on the other parts of the business, I feel okay about our position and nothing of note there. So that's pretty positive. And what we're going through right now, as a reminder, is we're transitioning a lot of the COVID-related activities to the normal therapies. And the team is doing a good job. It certainly impacts our growth in terms of headwind in 2024, but it becomes better in '25 and '26 as the new therapies and the tech transfers are complete and new lines come on place. So pretty good times ahead. Thanks, Tyco. Yes. So Puneet, thanks for the question. So when I think about the things that jump out to me the patterns, if you will, and I see lots of customers, and I'm looking forward to being back on the road tomorrow, seeing our customers is a great thing. In our larger customers, which -- and these will be the companies with many products that are both commercial and in their pipeline, you're seeing a few things. One, they're focused on resiliency of their supply chain. So where maybe historically pre-pandemic, they would have had single site in-house manufacturing, you're seeing much more of the second site, leveraging our capabilities. And that's great in terms of just making sure that they can meet their customer demand, if you will, for medicines. You're also seeing the desire for how do we help them be more innovative and productive. And you basically fund all of the exciting things in their pipeline by just helping them really prioritize the most important work and do that in the most effective way. So it's really about helping them do more to maximize the impact of what's in their pipeline. When I think about the smaller customers, because we had gone through a period in 2023 where funding was challenged, right, a lot of the tone was around how do they get through the period. When I think about the first six months of dialogue, much higher confidence, right? Funding is happening, but also the confidence that funding will be available really at a very different spot. And you're seeing that really translate into the earliest indicators of that, which is authorizations of new clinical trials and new activity. But I would expect that, that would sort of flow through the rest of the types of work we do as the year continues to unfold and as we get into '25. So I think that's a very positive development. Yes. I was encouraged by what I saw in academic and government in Q2. We had low single-digit growth, a relatively challenging comparison. So the team did a good job. What I'm seeing is on the high-end differentiated products, customers are getting money. I mean if I think through, consumers get money for the really great innovation. And given our track record on innovation, we're seeing strong demand for the Orbitrap Astral. And I know that there's a lot of excitement around the Thermo Scientific Stellar mass spectrometer and the eclipse series. These are really -- or series. These are really, really positive developments. And so I think it's good. I always think long-term academic and government globally, it was kind of a low-single-digit growth market, sometimes a little better than that. And for -- our performance is playing out in line with that right now. I mean the process is they have to apply, and there's a central government funding and matched by their other funding sources, usually provincial or it could be local depending on the institution. So they're going through that process. As it gets approved, they then have the ability to go out and place the order, so that's the view. I think because these institutions are funded by the government in all times, whether it's stimulus or not, I think they have a mechanism to understand what's likely to happen. So this is not giant mystery to them. I think they're working through it and is kind of normal from that perspective. And what we're doing is reminding them of the importance of the important instrumentation that we've launched and the relevance of it. So that they prioritize their funding request to support our instrumentation. Dan, thanks for the question, and I'll turn to just wrapping up. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, and we'll build an even brighter future for our company. We're looking forward to talking about that bright future at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19 in New York and updating you on our third quarter performance in October. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. My name is Angela, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. \nRafael Tejada: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events and Presentations until May 8, 2024. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2024 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. \n So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2024 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. \n So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. \nMarc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a great start to the year. We delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. I'm proud of our team's ongoing focus on enabling the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and our continued success as a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System. \n So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.34 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.28 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin in Q1 to 22%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 2% increase year-over-year to $5.11 per share. Our performance in the first quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance and sets us up to deliver differentiated performance in 2024. \n Turning to our performance by end market. In the first quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution enabled us to deliver differentiated revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations.  Now let me provide you some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech. We declined in the low single digits for the quarter, which was a sequential improvement in performance over Q4 2023. \n In the first quarter, the vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 3-point headwind for this customer segment. And we also delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. A quick reminder on academic and government and industrial and applied. A year ago, we had very strong shipments of analytical instruments as we worked down the backlog that was caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. As a result in academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business as well as in our research and safety market channel. \n In Industrial and Applied, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business in this segment.  Finally, in Diagnostics and Healthcare in Q1, we declined in the high single digits. The reported growth in this end market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, core revenue growth was highlighted by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our health care market channel. \n So wrapping up on our end markets. Underlying market conditions played out as we expected to start the year. As you recall, our assumption for 2024 is that we'll see a modest pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. During the quarter, it was good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that support this view, including continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program announced by China. \n I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, high-impact innovation. We had an excellent start to the year, launching a number of new products across our businesses during the first quarter. Let me first highlight a number of products in analytical instruments that demonstrate our continued market leadership. \n In our chromatography and mass spectrometry business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion Ion Chromatography system, which enables higher resolution, faster time to results and streamlined workflows to more efficiently identify contaminants for environmental testing. \n In our Chemical Analysis business, we launched the Thermo Scientific LInspector Edge In-line Metrology solution to enhance battery safety, performance and production. And we also launched the Thermo Scientific TruScan G3 Handheld Raman Analyzer, a next-generation handheld instrument for the rapid identification of chemical compounds used in drug production. \n And then in Life Science Solutions, we launched the Axiom PangenomiX Array, a high-throughput microarray for use in human genomic studies across global populations, including disease risk and detection research as well as population scale disease research programs. So another strong quarter of product launches. One other highlight of our high-impact innovation during the quarter was being named as one of Fast Company Magazine's Most Innovative Companies. It's great external recognition for the impact that our team is driving for our customers. \n Moving to the second pillar of our strategy. We are in the trusted partner status over many years, and it gives me the unique opportunity to connect with our customers' senior executive teams. Since the beginning of the year, I've had many meetings with our customers as they're turning to us more than ever. \n This is to both reinforce our partnership as well as to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges that they face. These conversations are happening across our company at all levels of the organization. Our customers see our team as part of theirs. And our culture of always finding a better way every day serves to reinforce our trusted partner status with our customers. \n We do not take lightly the trust our customers have in our company. And we'll continue to partner closely with them to enable their innovation and productivity. The first example of this is in our clinical next-generation sequencing business. In the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop a next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostic that will help identify patients who may benefit from Bayer's growing portfolio of precision cancer therapies. \n The second example is our Analytical Instrument business. We are partnering with the North Carolina Collaboratory to support PFAS research capacity in state as they help to identify and implement solutions to address PFAS contamination. This is the first network of its kind. And they'll use several of our state-of-the-art instruments, including the Orbitrap Astral in their research. \n And finally, in our Clinical Research business, I'll share 2 examples of how our trusted partner status comes to life as our customers look for solutions to their unmet needs. We expanded our portfolio of GMP lab services to include qPCR-based biosafety testing capabilities for the detection of bacteria and other contaminants in medicines. This offering enables significantly faster results versus traditional testing method, allowing for quicker delivery of medicines to patients. \n And we launched the CorEvitas Syndicated Clinical Registry in generalized pustular psoriasis to address an unmet need for real-world evidence related to outcomes for patients with this rare disease. As you recall, CorEvitas became part of our company last year. The business is performing very well and making a difference for our customers and patients. All of these are great examples of our trusted partner status. \n Now let me turn to our PPI Business System, which enables outstanding execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. You can see it in our strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the first quarter. Looking forward, our team is actively utilizing generative AI as part of the PPI Business System to increase efficiency and productivity as well as to continue to improve the customer experience across the company. \n To share a couple of examples of how we're applying AI, it's enabling us to accelerate software development timelines in our Analytical Instruments and Life Science Solutions businesses. We're also leveraging the combination of large language models with a vast and differentiated amount of data at our disposal. \n One benefit we're seeing is our ability to enhance the capability of our technical and customer service teams to more effectively serve our customers. Generative AI is another great example of how we continually strengthen the impact of the PPI Business System. \n Let me now give you an update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities, being a good steward of our planet and the focusing on [indiscernible] education and advancing global health equity. \n To that end, during the first quarter, we announced a collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council. Together, we'll establish a center of excellence and training program focused on molecular biology and life sciences. The facility will provide specialized education and support for professional development to scientists and laboratory professionals in Africa. I'm also pleased to share that Thermo Fisher achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index for the eighth year in a row. \n Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we reached the 1-year anniversary of The Binding Site acquisition, now our protein diagnostics business. Its financial performance is tracking ahead of the deal model with really strong growth. I recently had the chance to visit the headquarters of our protein diagnostics business and saw great progress they're making, given the exciting new products that can positively impact patient care for multiple myeloma. \n Turning to our planned acquisition of Olink. We're working through the regulatory process, and the transaction is on track to close by mid-2024. We look forward to welcoming new colleagues to the company later this year. And in terms of return of capital during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of shares and increased our dividend by 11%. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. In a nice recognition of both our team and track record, Thermo Fisher has once again been included on Fortune Magazine's List of Most Admired Companies. \n Let me now turn to our guidance. Given the stronger operational performance at the start of the year, we are raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion, and we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. \n So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. We continue to enable our customer success, and this continually reinforces our trusted partner status. Our strong results in Q1 position us to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. \n With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? \nStephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our first quarter results for the total company then provide color on our 4 business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. \n Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. \n In Q1, market conditions were as we expected. We had another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q1 financials meaningfully ahead of what we had assumed in our prior guidance. Core organic revenue was $150 million or 1.5% ahead, and adjusted EPS was $0.40 ahead. To give you some color on that $0.40, $0.19 was from very strong profitability pull-through on the revenue beat, $0.12 was from phasing of spending within the year, $0.07 was from lower FX headwinds and $0.02 was from lower net interest expense. So we're continuing to manage the business really well and are off to a great start to the year. \n Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with earnings per share. In the quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.11. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.46, up 4% from Q1 last year. On the top line, in Q1, reported revenue was 3% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue change included 4% lower organic revenue and a slight contribution from acquisitions. Q1 core organic revenue decreased 3%. And in the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $200 million, including $175 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. \n Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q1, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia Pacific and China declined in the low single digits. With respect to our operational performance. The team used the PPI Business System to execute really well in the quarter, delivering $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income, which is 22% of revenue, 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 150 basis points higher than Q1 last year. \n In the quarter, we continued to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management as well as the carryover benefits from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of lower volumes while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership.  \n Moving to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.5% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $330 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investment in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.2% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q1 net interest expense was $84 million, which is $70 million lower than Q1 2023 due to increased cash balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5%. And average diluted shares were 384 million in Q1, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.  \n Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with cash flow generation. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and free cash flow for Q1 was $910 million after investing $340 million of net capital expenditures. We continue to return capital to shareholders in Q1 with an 11% increase in our dividend and the $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We ended the quarter with $7.25 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter were 3.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.6x on a net debt basis.  \n Concluding my comments in our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we've been generating across the company. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment declined 13%, and organic revenue was 12% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter.  \n Q1 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 1%. And adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up 480 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q1, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team continues to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic.  \n In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue declined 2%, and organic growth was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in the electron microscopy business. And as a reminder, we have very strong comparisons in the segment in the quarter due to high level of instrument shipments in Q1 last year as we work down the backlog. In the segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 70 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments.  \n Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as in our health care market channel. Q1 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 5%. And adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, which is 120 basis points higher than Q1 2023. During the quarter, we delivered favorable business mix and good productivity, which was partially offset by strategic investments.  \n And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q1 versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. During the quarter, we delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. Q1 adjusted operating income declined 6%. And adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than Q1 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments.  \n Turning now to guidance. As Marc outlined, given the strong start to the year, we're raising our 2024 full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02. At the midpoint, that reflects a core revenue increase of just under $100 million. We continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in a range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We continue to assume that the market declines low single digits this year. Our growth strategy in PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again.  \n In terms of adjusted EPS. The increase in the guidance at the midpoint is just over $0.10. The majority of this is from the core revenue raise and also $0.02 from assumed lower net interest expense versus our prior guidance. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.4% and 22.8%, slightly improved from the prior guide. We continue to use the PPI Business System to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership.  \n So a great start to the year and increase in the guidance outlook. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance.  \n I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue.  \n We see that FX will be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. Given recent FX rate changes, we're assuming that the $0.07 beat that we saw in Q1 is offset in the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus our prior guide.  \n We expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion.  \n In terms of capital deployment. We're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, we continue to see [ we will close ] the Olink acquisition by midyear. Full year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares.  \n And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing. In Q2, we expect revenue dollars to step up from the first quarter, and organic growth will likely be 2 points better than Q1. And we expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be similar to Q1. This reflects the revised view of the phasing of spending within the year that I mentioned. I think this view of Q2 is pretty close to what's currently baked into consensus right now.  \n So to conclude. We delivered on our commitments in Q1, and we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. \nRafael Tejada: Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. \nDouglas Schenkel: Simply put, it was a better start than expected to the year. Marc, can you share color on: one, how did the quarter progress; and two, how does that progression. And really momentum heading into the second quarter, how do those things inform your thinking on the outlook for the balance of the year? \nMarc Casper: Doug, thanks. So I thought just in the spirit of continuous improvement in PPI that I would frame a few of the key points for the Q&A session and then get to your questions. So indulge me for a second. So when I think about the key points. One, I will start with the long term. We serve an awesome industry that has a bright future, right? And when you think about what drives the bright future, very durable growth driven by the great science, the strong pipelines and the unmet medical needs.  \n When I think about the first quarter, zooming into the short term, market conditions were in line with our expectations and really with strong execution in the quarter that resulted in the financial performance that was ahead of our expectations, it allowed us to retire risk as well as raise our full year outlook.  \n Reminding our investors what's assumed in the '24 guidance is that we're going to see a modest step-up or pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. And during the quarter, it was really good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that supports the view of a pickup as the year progresses, which is continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program that was announced by China.  \n As you know, how we define success is that we deliver differentiated short-term performance with a strong emphasis on share gain while strengthening our competitive position for the long term. And Q1 was another quarter in which we achieved that. So Doug, as I think about the phasing of the quarter, market really played out exactly as we thought it was. And we looked at the different parts of it and really in aggregate and the pieces that really played out that way.  \n As the quarter unfolded, what I would say is didn't see a huge change in pattern, although March was a little bit better than the first couple of months. You had the way Easter laid out, which kind of makes it a little bit hard to know exactly, but it felt like March was a good exit rate, consistent with a modest step-up, and that's baked into it. And I would say that April is, in the first couple of weeks kind of playing out with that as well. \nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. That's super helpful. And thank you for the high-level thoughts as well. If I could maybe just kind of double-click into an area of focus for all of us. Lab products and services was stronger than expected, relative to certainly what I had in my model and from what I can tell is in consensus.  \n In particular, obviously, the CRO and CDMO businesses are a focus for all of us. What are you seeing there? Is it fair to say that things are picking up there a little bit better and maybe better than expected? Keeping in mind that some of the early updates from CMO peers have been relatively encouraging. And then I think maybe more on the CRO side is where we'd see this impact. \n But as we kind of keep in mind that Q1 was the best biopharma funding quarter in about 5 years, how does that make you feel about the outlook for the next several quarters and the years ahead? \nStephen Williamson: Doug, I'll tee up kind of the view versus the consensus first, and I'm not going to talk about the kind of business dynamics. So we don't guide by segment in terms of our organic growth. And for us, it came in -- as Marc said, the markets came in as we had expected in aggregate. And that's the same thing for the segment, and we executed well. So it wasn't a huge outperformance part of the beat that was kind of pretty much across the board for the company. \nMarc Casper: Yes. And then when you get into the dynamics, the one thing I would call out is in our CRO capabilities, clinical research, the former PPD business, really excellent execution in the first quarter, drove really very strong performance, very proud of what the team accomplished. \n And when I think about the market dynamics, definitely seeing the pipeline of activity picking up. And as you certainly know, it takes a while for that to actually materialize into revenues, given the cycle of the business, but very encouraging given the biotech funding environment to see that level of pipeline of work picking up. So thank you, Doug. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin: Great. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, I want to pick up on something you just mentioned. You called out continued improvement in biotech funding environment. And earlier, you talked about the stimulus in China, 2 positive developments on the end market in 1Q. But I think you also acknowledged it's still relatively early going for those. And there have been a few false starts in end markets, of course, of 2023. \n So I guess the question is, what gives you confidence that these have really turned the corner? What data points you're looking for as the year progresses and especially given your position on the China Business Council. Just when do you think the better funding stimulus will show up as revenues for you for Thermo? \nMarc Casper: Yes. So Mike, I think it's a great question, I liked the way you framed it as well. So we're not -- nothing about false starts. The way that I think about it is and super clear on the word choice. What was assumed in our original guidance was a modest pickup. \n The 2 data points that I called out would be consistent with that view. So we're not changing our view upwards on the market, but rather what's going to drive the slight pickup, the fact that biotech funding is improving and that China announced a stimulus program. I think everybody was probably positively surprised that they announced it as early in the year as that they did, and they're trying to get their economy growing. Those are good facts to support the modest step-up and set ourselves up for an even stronger set of market conditions as we enter 2025. So that's how I think about the kind of the phasing of what's going on in the market. \n And then the other thing that I would just note about the quarter which was very positive is that it actually played out as we expected, right, including the 4 end markets. And that's good because, I mean, the normal incredible visibility and predictability that you typically have in this business is returning, which is helpful as well. \nMichael Ryskin: Okay. That's really helpful. And Doug asked about lab products and services. Let me focus on Analytical Instruments. You called out electron microscopy continue to do very well there. But -- and you do have really tough comps. But maybe you could focus a little bit on chromatography mass spec. What are you seeing there from an end market perspective? There's been a lot of concern about pharma CapEx budgets and sort of how they're trending in 2024. So any early comments you can say about that part of the portfolio? \nMarc Casper: Yes. So Mike, when I think about Analytical Instruments, we had a really good quarter. And it's against a very, very strong comparison, which is why I called it out because compared to the high teens growth last year, it's important to flag it. \n Let me start with electron microscopy then I'll get to chrome mass spec. So electron microscopy, the business has been performing at a great level, continues to have a strong order book and just doing a really good job. And I feel great about that. When I think about chromatography, mass spectrometry, they as well have incredibly strong comparisons. We're getting really good uptake on the Astral and really have had some milestone level of shipments on that product over the first 9 months of owning and [ relaunching ] it. So that's gone well. \n Most of our business is in the high-end research portion, which has done well for us. We have a little bit less exposure to kind of the more routine applications. I did flag one product that we launched, which is really quite relevant. As you know, we're the very strong market leader in ion chromatography. You hear a lot about PFAS testing, things of this sort. And we launched the next generation of instrumentation there, which it's great, just given how large our fleet is around the world, and that product is off to a great start. So I feel good about the outlook, the different pieces. \n And I highlighted a couple of interesting launches in chemical analysis, the smallest of the 3 businesses where we're enabling battery production and really trying to change the way that QA/QC is done in pharmaceutical manufacturing by having raw materials inspected at the factory versus doing lab testing and the Handheld Raman Analyzer does that. So really great innovation drives growth in the business and a really good performance to start the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. \nJack Meehan: Wanted to keep digging in on the pharma businesses here. So the first question is on clinical research. You called out strong growth. Just a clarification. Is this inclusive of the COVID headwinds you've talked about before? The tone sounds more positive. Any comments around what you're seeing would be great. \nMarc Casper: Yes. There's no adjustments on any of that. It's just business just grew through that. And when I think about the year, when I think about the guidance that some busy assumptions are better than the guidance. We reminded our investors that we had the largest role in clinical research on supporting the pandemic response. We also had, in parallel, incredible growth in the business, and really just an excellent start and excellent execution to deliver strong growth in the quarter. \n And while we expect this business will moderate this year relative to the last few years, just the momentum it has bodes extremely well for the midterm of high single-digit growth business plus synergies. So the team has done a great job of becoming part of the company, leveraging our relationships and getting really strong commercial momentum. So really nice start to the year. \nJack Meehan: Awesome. And then on the pharma services side, there's been a little bit of a competitive shake up with Novo's proposed acquisition of Catalent. Can you just talk about your win rates at Patheon and how you feel about the runway for future tech transfers? \nMarc Casper: Yes. So Jack, when I think about pharma services, the business has performed very well. And when I think about the industry dynamics that have gone on, in an area that we're the market leader, [ start until finish ] where we put the medicine or vaccine in its final dosage form. Effectively, you have one of the pure-play competitors being taken out of the CDMO business effectively or less so. \n And that in an area where capacity is constrained already, it bodes really well for our business. As the market leader and great reputation, our activity level is high. The number of dialogue we're having with our customers is high. We're securing new business. So I feel great about it. \n And our job as the trusted partner is to enable our customer success, right? And our customers think in decades in this industry. And when there's events that uncertain, whether it's Biosecure or whether it's an acquisition of one of the suppliers, they look at the industry leader and say, \"This is a company that doesn't create uncertainty, does a great job.\" Those things ultimately allow us to better support our customers going forward. \nOperator: The next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. \nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: Perfect. Congratulations on the quarter. So I wanted to dig into the comments around China stimulus a little bit more. Just on one hand, the language around the stimulus is fairly broad, but this tranche also appears to be 2.5x the dollar amount of the stimulus package that benefited last year. \n So can you walk us through what are you hearing from customers regarding the stimulus? Are you working on proposals with customers yet? Or have you even seen any orders related to that stimulus come through, albeit it's probably that early for that. \n And then just to follow up on those comments around the timeline for stimulus. If you look at what happened last year, the stimulus was actually announced in September '22, but we really didn't see an impact until early 2023. So given that delay between initial announcement and actually seeing the benefit, in your view, could we potentially see the benefit this year? Or could this ultimately be a 2025 dynamic? \nMarc Casper: So Rachel, thanks for the question. I share the enthusiasm about the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, get things going. So it's an interesting time in that respect. So... \nStephen Williamson: And just back to Mike's comment about what the view on is this start, these starts, false start, I think it's a good thing that China is trying to find ways to stimulate the economy. And I think this is one element of it, and we look forward to other things happening as well as just the way the China is managing the economy. As Marc said, go ahead. \nMarc Casper: Yes, yes. So when I think about actually the way things play out, and a lot of this is about signaling as far as I can tell from my own experience of work in China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which was shorter term. \n So basically, the government is signaling, at least, to the economy that they're looking for investments in instrumentation equipment, technological advances, advanced research. So that's very encouraging in terms of that it's not a short-term program, but rather longer term. And yes, we've already have proposals in front of customers. And yes, there's quite a bit of dialogue. Customers are actually waiting for some of the very practical details of how this will work because it varies by province, ultimately. \n So to my knowledge, no orders yet. I wouldn't expect any of that quickly anyway but lots of activity. And the way that I would think about this is there's the direct effect and then the indirect effect. I would expect that we would see orders really later in the year and some revenue late in the year directly associated with the stimulus, but that may miss by a few months, one way or the other. So I wouldn't expect material shipments in Q2 around this. So it would be the way I would think about my experience. \n The indirect effect is a confidence booster, right, which is basically saying the government is going to try to get the economy up and going. And that should help more broadly, and that doesn't help tomorrow, but it helps from a contextual standpoint of business confidence. \n So I think those things would say that you're seeing China try to get the economy growing. We're not assuming a lot in China in our numbers this year as part of major changes. So what I'm most excited about there is that it sets up for '25. Not that we won't see a benefit this year, but it's kind of a direction of travel. And our view is more of a return tranche should be a good market for us. \nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: Perfect. Really appreciate all that detail. I just wanted to stick on China for my follow-up then. Obviously, we've seen some of these headlines around Biosecure Act. We've heard some of your customers talking about trying to derisk some of their supply chains and go with more Western manufacturers, just given where we're at from that headline perspective. \n So I wanted to see how has that been impacting your customer conversations? Have you seen any increase in inbounds in terms of Patheon? And then just from a timing, if you were to benefit from this. Obviously, a pretty capacity-constrained sector right now. I know you mentioned some of the Catalent-Novo dynamics earlier as well. \n Could you even benefit in the near term from any competitive wins related to Biosecure? Or is it just a function of capacity constrained, this really alludes to the value chain and the vertical integration that Thermo has but will be more of a benefit longer term? \nMarc Casper: So the way that I think about Biosecure is I kind of put it into the context of there's a level of geopolitical tensions that exist around the world, including between the U.S. and China. It's never exactly clear whether these things become enacted or not. It's our job to help our customers navigate those shifting landscapes. I think at the highest level, actually relations are falling between the countries a bit. There will always be challenges. \n When I think about how this could play out, should it play out, I think that what is making the customer base that's largely Western in terms of where biotech and pharmaceutical activity is largely, I think more of supply chains, who's doing development work, et cetera. \n Given our network is effectively 100% in U.S. and Western Europe and that set of capabilities, we're likely to be a long-term beneficiary, not per se of the Act, but rather the fact that customers are thinking about who are their partners and where should those partners be based. So I think that's a long term, should be okay, and I don't think it has any material impact to the results in the short term. Thank you, Rachel. \nOperator: The next question is from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. \nDaniel Brennan: Marc and Stephen, maybe just on China. I know some -- there's already been some discussion points here, Marc. But could you just give us a sense how the low single-digit decline in the quarter kind of compared to expectations? And just remind us what to assume for the full year? And kind of any color you can share about just demand trends across your business segments in China. \nMarc Casper: So when I think about China, that actually played out as we expected. The team delivered on the expectations for the quarter. And as you know, our guidance, we don't guide by geography or by business. It's really the aggregate overall. But actually, the first quarter played out as the team expected and executed well. When you kind of go down to the subsegments of China, now you're going to the tiny portion of our revenue. Nothing really significant of note in terms of things better or worse than what we've been seeing or what we would expect. So that's will be a high-level deal. Looking forward to returning to China early in the summer. So get some firsthand perspectives on that as well. \nDaniel Brennan: Got it. And then maybe just on bioprocessing. I know the consumable portion of your business, Marc is, call it, 10% of our revenues, but there's obviously a tremendous focus there right now. Could you give any color on how that business performed in the quarter? And any color you can provide on like this ongoing destock issue. Whether or not you've seen orders start to grow again sequentially. \nMarc Casper: Yes, Dan, thanks for the question on bioproduction. It's definitely a factor. Where it got in the queue of the question, it says that the emphasis is reducing on that so as becoming a little bit more predictable. Really, Q1 was in line with expectations. Organic growth did decline as we expected in the quarter due to the strong comparisons from a year ago. But when I look at orders, that's now 2 quarters in a row with really good sequential bookings growth, nice improvement in book-to-bill. And when I look at the things that have been said externally about the quarter, I feel really good about our performance in terms of how we execute it. So working out, in line with what we thought would happen. Thanks, Dan. \nOperator: The next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Sykes: Maybe just revisiting the AI segment and maybe just compare, contrast the end markets and where you're seeing some of the greatest strength. It sounds like industrial applied remains strong, but just would love to hear you kind of go through biopharma, applied industrial and academic, government and sort of the phasing of growth over the course of this year in those end markets for AI. \nMarc Casper: Sure. So when I think about the business, one of the things, Matt, is we really don't manage it by end segment because effectively, you produce a certain amount of products, and then you ship them to specific customers. So you can have quarters where you ship more to an industrial customer, the exact same product as a biopharma customer. And therefore, it kind of skews things. So that's my caveat of that. \n When I look at the parts of the business, the industrial and applied continues to have strong momentum in semiconductor material science applications for electron microscopy was strong. So in terms of how that played out, very difficult comparisons for all of the businesses based on the shipments a year ago, but that was strong. And then the other segments in terms of academic, government, pharma, biotech, pretty much played out as we expected. So nothing that really jumped out at me as being significant in terms of trends or patterns. \nMatthew Sykes: Got it. And then just for my follow-up. Just on LPS and the margins, I know when you had acquired PPD, you talked about potential for long-term margin expansion in that business. Could you just maybe talk about some of the levers you've got within LPS. Understanding that revenue improvement would help a lot, but just any levers to get that margin within LPS to expand that over time. \nMarc Casper: I'll start, and then maybe Stephen will add a few additional thoughts. So when I think about margins and obviously, you have different businesses there. The clinical research business, formerly PPD, incredibly strong operational execution, right? So when you actually look at utilization rates, modification, all of the things that ultimately drive margins, they're doing a great job and executing really well. \n We're, obviously, benefiting from the synergies that we outlined, and we will have achieved all of our synergy targets on the cost side. So that's gone well. And so they're really doing a great job of executing the trials really well, and that bodes well for margin expansion along with volume. When I think about pharma services, there, the underlying is very strong. But we obviously have capacity coming online and also the runoff of the COVID revenues. So when you lose the volume, you see short-term pressure on margins. \n But if I say, how is the team operating? Actually, the team is operating well. So the margins there will expand as the year progresses and into the future as well. So that will be my thoughts about margins. I don't know, Stephen, anything? \nStephen Williamson: I think on the pharma services side, it's the capacity coming online and switching over. There's cost to do that as you're ramping up the facility, bringing on the colleagues to be able to operate that facility. Those are all factors that come into that, but those are the right drivers. Thanks, Matt. \nOperator: The last question we have time for today is from Luke Sergott with Barclays. \nLuke Sergott: So I want to dig back in into the Biosecure Act, a follow-up on what Rachel was asking about. But I wanted to know, Marc, what you guys are hearing from your customers and multinationals that operate over there and what they're saying to you regarding their assumptions on China retaliating and maybe excluding them from the region. I know it seems pretty unlikely, and it's probably going to be limited, but is this something that is on their radar or some of those conversations that you're having? \nMarc Casper: Yes. I can't really speculate. It wouldn't be prudent on how -- whether this thing will even come to pass. And if it comes to pass, what is the response to it. Our job is to do a great job of supporting our customers globally to comply with the global regulations, both the actual regulations and the spirit of the regulations of the various countries, and we'll do a good job navigating it. So that's how I would think about it, Luke. \nLuke Sergott: Yes. Okay. And then, Stephen, for you on the life science margins. So very, very strong here from Life Science Solutions. I understand that the destocking is less of an issue, but how much of the step-up in the quarter was from the restocking? Just kind of walk through it and double-click on the drivers there. And should we consider this as kind of the jump-off point? Or it will be around this range for the rest of the year? Anything from a modeling perspective? \nStephen Williamson: So Luke, the really good margin profile in the segment. And it's really about addressing the cost base in that business given the lower volumes, both from the pandemic unwind and the kind of the bioproduction aspect to it. So it's really just fundamentally investing the costs that we have in that business. Team's done a great job of doing that, and that's the way to think about that. \nMarc Casper: So thank you, Luke, and thanks, everyone, for the questions. So let me wrap up. Very pleased to deliver a very strong quarter. Incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, build an even brighter future for our company. I look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in July and discussing our very bright future as well as outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19. \n As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Williamson",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our first quarter results for the total company then provide color on our 4 business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. \n Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. \n In Q1, market conditions were as we expected. We had another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q1 financials meaningfully ahead of what we had assumed in our prior guidance. Core organic revenue was $150 million or 1.5% ahead, and adjusted EPS was $0.40 ahead. To give you some color on that $0.40, $0.19 was from very strong profitability pull-through on the revenue beat, $0.12 was from phasing of spending within the year, $0.07 was from lower FX headwinds and $0.02 was from lower net interest expense. So we're continuing to manage the business really well and are off to a great start to the year. \n Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with earnings per share. In the quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.11. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.46, up 4% from Q1 last year. On the top line, in Q1, reported revenue was 3% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue change included 4% lower organic revenue and a slight contribution from acquisitions. Q1 core organic revenue decreased 3%. And in the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $200 million, including $175 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. \n Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q1, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia Pacific and China declined in the low single digits. With respect to our operational performance. The team used the PPI Business System to execute really well in the quarter, delivering $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income, which is 22% of revenue, 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 150 basis points higher than Q1 last year. \n In the quarter, we continued to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management as well as the carryover benefits from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of lower volumes while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership.  \n Moving to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.5% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $330 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investment in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.2% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q1 net interest expense was $84 million, which is $70 million lower than Q1 2023 due to increased cash balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5%. And average diluted shares were 384 million in Q1, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.  \n Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with cash flow generation. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and free cash flow for Q1 was $910 million after investing $340 million of net capital expenditures. We continue to return capital to shareholders in Q1 with an 11% increase in our dividend and the $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We ended the quarter with $7.25 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter were 3.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.6x on a net debt basis.  \n Concluding my comments in our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we've been generating across the company. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment declined 13%, and organic revenue was 12% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter.  \n Q1 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 1%. And adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up 480 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q1, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team continues to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic.  \n In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue declined 2%, and organic growth was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in the electron microscopy business. And as a reminder, we have very strong comparisons in the segment in the quarter due to high level of instrument shipments in Q1 last year as we work down the backlog. In the segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 70 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments.  \n Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as in our health care market channel. Q1 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 5%. And adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, which is 120 basis points higher than Q1 2023. During the quarter, we delivered favorable business mix and good productivity, which was partially offset by strategic investments.  \n And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q1 versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. During the quarter, we delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. Q1 adjusted operating income declined 6%. And adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than Q1 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments.  \n Turning now to guidance. As Marc outlined, given the strong start to the year, we're raising our 2024 full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02. At the midpoint, that reflects a core revenue increase of just under $100 million. We continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in a range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We continue to assume that the market declines low single digits this year. Our growth strategy in PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again.  \n In terms of adjusted EPS. The increase in the guidance at the midpoint is just over $0.10. The majority of this is from the core revenue raise and also $0.02 from assumed lower net interest expense versus our prior guidance. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.4% and 22.8%, slightly improved from the prior guide. We continue to use the PPI Business System to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership.  \n So a great start to the year and increase in the guidance outlook. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance.  \n I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue.  \n We see that FX will be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. Given recent FX rate changes, we're assuming that the $0.07 beat that we saw in Q1 is offset in the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus our prior guide.  \n We expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion.  \n In terms of capital deployment. We're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, we continue to see [ we will close ] the Olink acquisition by midyear. Full year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares.  \n And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing. In Q2, we expect revenue dollars to step up from the first quarter, and organic growth will likely be 2 points better than Q1. And we expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be similar to Q1. This reflects the revised view of the phasing of spending within the year that I mentioned. I think this view of Q2 is pretty close to what's currently baked into consensus right now.  \n So to conclude. We delivered on our commitments in Q1, and we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Doug, I'll tee up kind of the view versus the consensus first, and I'm not going to talk about the kind of business dynamics. So we don't guide by segment in terms of our organic growth. And for us, it came in -- as Marc said, the markets came in as we had expected in aggregate. And that's the same thing for the segment, and we executed well. So it wasn't a huge outperformance part of the beat that was kind of pretty much across the board for the company. And just back to Mike's comment about what the view on is this start, these starts, false start, I think it's a good thing that China is trying to find ways to stimulate the economy. And I think this is one element of it, and we look forward to other things happening as well as just the way the China is managing the economy. As Marc said, go ahead. I think on the pharma services side, it's the capacity coming online and switching over. There's cost to do that as you're ramping up the facility, bringing on the colleagues to be able to operate that facility. Those are all factors that come into that, but those are the right drivers. Thanks, Matt. So Luke, the really good margin profile in the segment. And it's really about addressing the cost base in that business given the lower volumes, both from the pandemic unwind and the kind of the bioproduction aspect to it. So it's really just fundamentally investing the costs that we have in that business. Team's done a great job of doing that, and that's the way to think about that."

            "name": "Marc Casper",
            "content": "Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a great start to the year. We delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. I'm proud of our team's ongoing focus on enabling the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and our continued success as a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System. \n So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.34 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.28 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin in Q1 to 22%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 2% increase year-over-year to $5.11 per share. Our performance in the first quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance and sets us up to deliver differentiated performance in 2024. \n Turning to our performance by end market. In the first quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution enabled us to deliver differentiated revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations.  Now let me provide you some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech. We declined in the low single digits for the quarter, which was a sequential improvement in performance over Q4 2023. \n In the first quarter, the vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 3-point headwind for this customer segment. And we also delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. A quick reminder on academic and government and industrial and applied. A year ago, we had very strong shipments of analytical instruments as we worked down the backlog that was caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. As a result in academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business as well as in our research and safety market channel. \n In Industrial and Applied, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business in this segment.  Finally, in Diagnostics and Healthcare in Q1, we declined in the high single digits. The reported growth in this end market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, core revenue growth was highlighted by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our health care market channel. \n So wrapping up on our end markets. Underlying market conditions played out as we expected to start the year. As you recall, our assumption for 2024 is that we'll see a modest pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. During the quarter, it was good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that support this view, including continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program announced by China. \n I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, high-impact innovation. We had an excellent start to the year, launching a number of new products across our businesses during the first quarter. Let me first highlight a number of products in analytical instruments that demonstrate our continued market leadership. \n In our chromatography and mass spectrometry business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion Ion Chromatography system, which enables higher resolution, faster time to results and streamlined workflows to more efficiently identify contaminants for environmental testing. \n In our Chemical Analysis business, we launched the Thermo Scientific LInspector Edge In-line Metrology solution to enhance battery safety, performance and production. And we also launched the Thermo Scientific TruScan G3 Handheld Raman Analyzer, a next-generation handheld instrument for the rapid identification of chemical compounds used in drug production. \n And then in Life Science Solutions, we launched the Axiom PangenomiX Array, a high-throughput microarray for use in human genomic studies across global populations, including disease risk and detection research as well as population scale disease research programs. So another strong quarter of product launches. One other highlight of our high-impact innovation during the quarter was being named as one of Fast Company Magazine's Most Innovative Companies. It's great external recognition for the impact that our team is driving for our customers. \n Moving to the second pillar of our strategy. We are in the trusted partner status over many years, and it gives me the unique opportunity to connect with our customers' senior executive teams. Since the beginning of the year, I've had many meetings with our customers as they're turning to us more than ever. \n This is to both reinforce our partnership as well as to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges that they face. These conversations are happening across our company at all levels of the organization. Our customers see our team as part of theirs. And our culture of always finding a better way every day serves to reinforce our trusted partner status with our customers. \n We do not take lightly the trust our customers have in our company. And we'll continue to partner closely with them to enable their innovation and productivity. The first example of this is in our clinical next-generation sequencing business. In the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop a next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostic that will help identify patients who may benefit from Bayer's growing portfolio of precision cancer therapies. \n The second example is our Analytical Instrument business. We are partnering with the North Carolina Collaboratory to support PFAS research capacity in state as they help to identify and implement solutions to address PFAS contamination. This is the first network of its kind. And they'll use several of our state-of-the-art instruments, including the Orbitrap Astral in their research. \n And finally, in our Clinical Research business, I'll share 2 examples of how our trusted partner status comes to life as our customers look for solutions to their unmet needs. We expanded our portfolio of GMP lab services to include qPCR-based biosafety testing capabilities for the detection of bacteria and other contaminants in medicines. This offering enables significantly faster results versus traditional testing method, allowing for quicker delivery of medicines to patients. \n And we launched the CorEvitas Syndicated Clinical Registry in generalized pustular psoriasis to address an unmet need for real-world evidence related to outcomes for patients with this rare disease. As you recall, CorEvitas became part of our company last year. The business is performing very well and making a difference for our customers and patients. All of these are great examples of our trusted partner status. \n Now let me turn to our PPI Business System, which enables outstanding execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. You can see it in our strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the first quarter. Looking forward, our team is actively utilizing generative AI as part of the PPI Business System to increase efficiency and productivity as well as to continue to improve the customer experience across the company. \n To share a couple of examples of how we're applying AI, it's enabling us to accelerate software development timelines in our Analytical Instruments and Life Science Solutions businesses. We're also leveraging the combination of large language models with a vast and differentiated amount of data at our disposal. \n One benefit we're seeing is our ability to enhance the capability of our technical and customer service teams to more effectively serve our customers. Generative AI is another great example of how we continually strengthen the impact of the PPI Business System. \n Let me now give you an update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities, being a good steward of our planet and the focusing on [indiscernible] education and advancing global health equity. \n To that end, during the first quarter, we announced a collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council. Together, we'll establish a center of excellence and training program focused on molecular biology and life sciences. The facility will provide specialized education and support for professional development to scientists and laboratory professionals in Africa. I'm also pleased to share that Thermo Fisher achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index for the eighth year in a row. \n Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we reached the 1-year anniversary of The Binding Site acquisition, now our protein diagnostics business. Its financial performance is tracking ahead of the deal model with really strong growth. I recently had the chance to visit the headquarters of our protein diagnostics business and saw great progress they're making, given the exciting new products that can positively impact patient care for multiple myeloma. \n Turning to our planned acquisition of Olink. We're working through the regulatory process, and the transaction is on track to close by mid-2024. We look forward to welcoming new colleagues to the company later this year. And in terms of return of capital during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of shares and increased our dividend by 11%. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. In a nice recognition of both our team and track record, Thermo Fisher has once again been included on Fortune Magazine's List of Most Admired Companies. \n Let me now turn to our guidance. Given the stronger operational performance at the start of the year, we are raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion, and we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. \n So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. We continue to enable our customer success, and this continually reinforces our trusted partner status. Our strong results in Q1 position us to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. \n With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Doug, thanks. So I thought just in the spirit of continuous improvement in PPI that I would frame a few of the key points for the Q&A session and then get to your questions. So indulge me for a second. So when I think about the key points. One, I will start with the long term. We serve an awesome industry that has a bright future, right? And when you think about what drives the bright future, very durable growth driven by the great science, the strong pipelines and the unmet medical needs.  \n When I think about the first quarter, zooming into the short term, market conditions were in line with our expectations and really with strong execution in the quarter that resulted in the financial performance that was ahead of our expectations, it allowed us to retire risk as well as raise our full year outlook.  \n Reminding our investors what's assumed in the '24 guidance is that we're going to see a modest step-up or pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. And during the quarter, it was really good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that supports the view of a pickup as the year progresses, which is continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program that was announced by China.  \n As you know, how we define success is that we deliver differentiated short-term performance with a strong emphasis on share gain while strengthening our competitive position for the long term. And Q1 was another quarter in which we achieved that. So Doug, as I think about the phasing of the quarter, market really played out exactly as we thought it was. And we looked at the different parts of it and really in aggregate and the pieces that really played out that way.  \n As the quarter unfolded, what I would say is didn't see a huge change in pattern, although March was a little bit better than the first couple of months. You had the way Easter laid out, which kind of makes it a little bit hard to know exactly, but it felt like March was a good exit rate, consistent with a modest step-up, and that's baked into it. And I would say that April is, in the first couple of weeks kind of playing out with that as well. Yes. And then when you get into the dynamics, the one thing I would call out is in our CRO capabilities, clinical research, the former PPD business, really excellent execution in the first quarter, drove really very strong performance, very proud of what the team accomplished. \n And when I think about the market dynamics, definitely seeing the pipeline of activity picking up. And as you certainly know, it takes a while for that to actually materialize into revenues, given the cycle of the business, but very encouraging given the biotech funding environment to see that level of pipeline of work picking up. So thank you, Doug. Yes. So Mike, I think it's a great question, I liked the way you framed it as well. So we're not -- nothing about false starts. The way that I think about it is and super clear on the word choice. What was assumed in our original guidance was a modest pickup. \n The 2 data points that I called out would be consistent with that view. So we're not changing our view upwards on the market, but rather what's going to drive the slight pickup, the fact that biotech funding is improving and that China announced a stimulus program. I think everybody was probably positively surprised that they announced it as early in the year as that they did, and they're trying to get their economy growing. Those are good facts to support the modest step-up and set ourselves up for an even stronger set of market conditions as we enter 2025. So that's how I think about the kind of the phasing of what's going on in the market. \n And then the other thing that I would just note about the quarter which was very positive is that it actually played out as we expected, right, including the 4 end markets. And that's good because, I mean, the normal incredible visibility and predictability that you typically have in this business is returning, which is helpful as well. Yes. So Mike, when I think about Analytical Instruments, we had a really good quarter. And it's against a very, very strong comparison, which is why I called it out because compared to the high teens growth last year, it's important to flag it. \n Let me start with electron microscopy then I'll get to chrome mass spec. So electron microscopy, the business has been performing at a great level, continues to have a strong order book and just doing a really good job. And I feel great about that. When I think about chromatography, mass spectrometry, they as well have incredibly strong comparisons. We're getting really good uptake on the Astral and really have had some milestone level of shipments on that product over the first 9 months of owning and [ relaunching ] it. So that's gone well. \n Most of our business is in the high-end research portion, which has done well for us. We have a little bit less exposure to kind of the more routine applications. I did flag one product that we launched, which is really quite relevant. As you know, we're the very strong market leader in ion chromatography. You hear a lot about PFAS testing, things of this sort. And we launched the next generation of instrumentation there, which it's great, just given how large our fleet is around the world, and that product is off to a great start. So I feel good about the outlook, the different pieces. \n And I highlighted a couple of interesting launches in chemical analysis, the smallest of the 3 businesses where we're enabling battery production and really trying to change the way that QA/QC is done in pharmaceutical manufacturing by having raw materials inspected at the factory versus doing lab testing and the Handheld Raman Analyzer does that. So really great innovation drives growth in the business and a really good performance to start the year. Yes. There's no adjustments on any of that. It's just business just grew through that. And when I think about the year, when I think about the guidance that some busy assumptions are better than the guidance. We reminded our investors that we had the largest role in clinical research on supporting the pandemic response. We also had, in parallel, incredible growth in the business, and really just an excellent start and excellent execution to deliver strong growth in the quarter. \n And while we expect this business will moderate this year relative to the last few years, just the momentum it has bodes extremely well for the midterm of high single-digit growth business plus synergies. So the team has done a great job of becoming part of the company, leveraging our relationships and getting really strong commercial momentum. So really nice start to the year. Yes. So Jack, when I think about pharma services, the business has performed very well. And when I think about the industry dynamics that have gone on, in an area that we're the market leader, [ start until finish ] where we put the medicine or vaccine in its final dosage form. Effectively, you have one of the pure-play competitors being taken out of the CDMO business effectively or less so. \n And that in an area where capacity is constrained already, it bodes really well for our business. As the market leader and great reputation, our activity level is high. The number of dialogue we're having with our customers is high. We're securing new business. So I feel great about it. \n And our job as the trusted partner is to enable our customer success, right? And our customers think in decades in this industry. And when there's events that uncertain, whether it's Biosecure or whether it's an acquisition of one of the suppliers, they look at the industry leader and say, \"This is a company that doesn't create uncertainty, does a great job.\" Those things ultimately allow us to better support our customers going forward. So Rachel, thanks for the question. I share the enthusiasm about the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, get things going. So it's an interesting time in that respect. So... Yes, yes. So when I think about actually the way things play out, and a lot of this is about signaling as far as I can tell from my own experience of work in China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which was shorter term. \n So basically, the government is signaling, at least, to the economy that they're looking for investments in instrumentation equipment, technological advances, advanced research. So that's very encouraging in terms of that it's not a short-term program, but rather longer term. And yes, we've already have proposals in front of customers. And yes, there's quite a bit of dialogue. Customers are actually waiting for some of the very practical details of how this will work because it varies by province, ultimately. \n So to my knowledge, no orders yet. I wouldn't expect any of that quickly anyway but lots of activity. And the way that I would think about this is there's the direct effect and then the indirect effect. I would expect that we would see orders really later in the year and some revenue late in the year directly associated with the stimulus, but that may miss by a few months, one way or the other. So I wouldn't expect material shipments in Q2 around this. So it would be the way I would think about my experience. \n The indirect effect is a confidence booster, right, which is basically saying the government is going to try to get the economy up and going. And that should help more broadly, and that doesn't help tomorrow, but it helps from a contextual standpoint of business confidence. \n So I think those things would say that you're seeing China try to get the economy growing. We're not assuming a lot in China in our numbers this year as part of major changes. So what I'm most excited about there is that it sets up for '25. Not that we won't see a benefit this year, but it's kind of a direction of travel. And our view is more of a return tranche should be a good market for us. So the way that I think about Biosecure is I kind of put it into the context of there's a level of geopolitical tensions that exist around the world, including between the U.S. and China. It's never exactly clear whether these things become enacted or not. It's our job to help our customers navigate those shifting landscapes. I think at the highest level, actually relations are falling between the countries a bit. There will always be challenges. \n When I think about how this could play out, should it play out, I think that what is making the customer base that's largely Western in terms of where biotech and pharmaceutical activity is largely, I think more of supply chains, who's doing development work, et cetera. \n Given our network is effectively 100% in U.S. and Western Europe and that set of capabilities, we're likely to be a long-term beneficiary, not per se of the Act, but rather the fact that customers are thinking about who are their partners and where should those partners be based. So I think that's a long term, should be okay, and I don't think it has any material impact to the results in the short term. Thank you, Rachel. So when I think about China, that actually played out as we expected. The team delivered on the expectations for the quarter. And as you know, our guidance, we don't guide by geography or by business. It's really the aggregate overall. But actually, the first quarter played out as the team expected and executed well. When you kind of go down to the subsegments of China, now you're going to the tiny portion of our revenue. Nothing really significant of note in terms of things better or worse than what we've been seeing or what we would expect. So that's will be a high-level deal. Looking forward to returning to China early in the summer. So get some firsthand perspectives on that as well. Yes, Dan, thanks for the question on bioproduction. It's definitely a factor. Where it got in the queue of the question, it says that the emphasis is reducing on that so as becoming a little bit more predictable. Really, Q1 was in line with expectations. Organic growth did decline as we expected in the quarter due to the strong comparisons from a year ago. But when I look at orders, that's now 2 quarters in a row with really good sequential bookings growth, nice improvement in book-to-bill. And when I look at the things that have been said externally about the quarter, I feel really good about our performance in terms of how we execute it. So working out, in line with what we thought would happen. Thanks, Dan. Sure. So when I think about the business, one of the things, Matt, is we really don't manage it by end segment because effectively, you produce a certain amount of products, and then you ship them to specific customers. So you can have quarters where you ship more to an industrial customer, the exact same product as a biopharma customer. And therefore, it kind of skews things. So that's my caveat of that. \n When I look at the parts of the business, the industrial and applied continues to have strong momentum in semiconductor material science applications for electron microscopy was strong. So in terms of how that played out, very difficult comparisons for all of the businesses based on the shipments a year ago, but that was strong. And then the other segments in terms of academic, government, pharma, biotech, pretty much played out as we expected. So nothing that really jumped out at me as being significant in terms of trends or patterns. I'll start, and then maybe Stephen will add a few additional thoughts. So when I think about margins and obviously, you have different businesses there. The clinical research business, formerly PPD, incredibly strong operational execution, right? So when you actually look at utilization rates, modification, all of the things that ultimately drive margins, they're doing a great job and executing really well. \n We're, obviously, benefiting from the synergies that we outlined, and we will have achieved all of our synergy targets on the cost side. So that's gone well. And so they're really doing a great job of executing the trials really well, and that bodes well for margin expansion along with volume. When I think about pharma services, there, the underlying is very strong. But we obviously have capacity coming online and also the runoff of the COVID revenues. So when you lose the volume, you see short-term pressure on margins. \n But if I say, how is the team operating? Actually, the team is operating well. So the margins there will expand as the year progresses and into the future as well. So that will be my thoughts about margins. I don't know, Stephen, anything? Yes. I can't really speculate. It wouldn't be prudent on how -- whether this thing will even come to pass. And if it comes to pass, what is the response to it. Our job is to do a great job of supporting our customers globally to comply with the global regulations, both the actual regulations and the spirit of the regulations of the various countries, and we'll do a good job navigating it. So that's how I would think about it, Luke. So thank you, Luke, and thanks, everyone, for the questions. So let me wrap up. Very pleased to deliver a very strong quarter. Incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, build an even brighter future for our company. I look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in July and discussing our very bright future as well as outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19. \n As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone."
