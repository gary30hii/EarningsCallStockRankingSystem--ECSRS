It will be available for replay through November 12, 2020, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number, 4475229. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Kristen Stewart, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms. Stewart, you may begin.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to BD's review of our fiscal fourth quarter results. Joining me today, we have Tom Polen, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will have three segment Presidents joining us. Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Patrick Kaltenbach, President of our Life Sciences segment, and Simon Campion, President of Interventional segment. A few logistics before we get into the call. This call is being made available via webcast at bd.com, where you can also find accompanying slides. Unless otherwise specified all comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis versus fiscal 2019 and percent changes are on FX-neutral basis. During the call, we will be making some forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q. In particular, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commentary we are providing today includes our best estimate based on the information that we currently have. We have made certain assumptions in how we are managing our business, but that could change as we move forward. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. These are all available on the bd.com website. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom?\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Kristen. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well, and thank you for joining us. For today's call, I want to address three main topics. First, my high level perspective on the quarter and full-year performance; second, I'll give an update on several hot topics we're fully focused on; and finally, I will share progress on BD strategy. Then I'll turn it over to Chris for a review of the P&L and an update on our outlook. So let's jump right in. First, I'll start with the quarter and the full-year performance. In Q4, we had better-than-expected revenue and not only our COVID-related diagnostics testing, but also our core business that allowed us to not only deliver EPS upside, but also importantly gave us the opportunity to make some strategic investments aligned to our BD 2025 growth strategy. Revenues were up 4.4% on a reported and FX-neutral basis as we were able to offset the overall impact of COVID-19 and grew despite the Alaris ship hold. I want to acknowledge the exceptional execution by our Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business this quarter, particularly the BD Veritor team. The team exceeded our commitments, successfully developing the BD Veritor COVID-19 assay in an accelerated timeframe, securing several regulatory approvals, scaling up manufacturing and continuing to advance the science behind the utility and effectiveness of rapid antigen point-of-care testing. Total COVID-19 testing revenues allowed us to offset the ongoing COVID headwinds and other businesses from lower hospital utilization, surgical procedures, routine lab testing volumes, and research spending. In fact, because of our COVID testing revenues, we were able to move from a net negative COVID impact in Q3 to a net positive COVID impact in Q4. If you exclude COVID-19 testing and look at performance of the base businesses, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement across all of our three segments during the quarter. As you would expect, the pace of the recovery varied by both product category and by geography. So all in, the BD team was able to deliver Q4 mid single-digit sales growth, overcoming the headwinds from COVID-19 and the Alaris ship hold, the latter we estimate to be 240 basis points in the quarter. Our Q4 adjusted EPS was $2.79 down 15.7% on a year-over-year basis. While our revenues returned to growth, we did continue to see some COVID-related pressure, dilution from our May equity issuance and headwinds from the last quarter of the Gore royalty contributed to our EPS decline. As I look back on the year, we faced a number of challenges from the Alaris ship hold to COVID-19 and its significant impact on healthcare utilization globally. In our fiscal Q3, COVID-19 had about a $600 million negative impact to our topline. However, the BD team executed strongly, swiftly launching multiple innovative COVID-19 diagnostic solutions and focusing on execution to return to growth in Q4 and finished the year with revenues flat on an FX-neutral basis. I'm proud of the team for their hard work, closing the year strong and offsetting the continued COVID-19 headwinds. Now I want to turn to several hot topics. Let's start with review of our COVID testing in the quarter. As I said, I was very pleased with the IDS team's execution this quarter with COVID-19 testing sales coming in at approximately $440 million with Veritor revenues at over $340 million in the quarter. We are able to ramp-up Veritor manufacturing capacity faster than originally expected, a testament to BD\u2019s world-class manufacturing excellence. We\u2019re also able to sustain a higher average selling price for longer than we anticipated. Looking ahead, we do expect price erosion as additional competitors have come to market and more may do some. We continue to work diligently to expand our BD Veritor and BD MAX manufacturing capacity. Our previously communicated capacity expansions remain firmly intact. We continue to monitor the supply and demand dynamics of the market. And we'll provide you with updates on additional capacity expansions to the extent any further new capacity comes online. On the customer side, we continue to see very strong demand for BD Veritor and BD MAX COVID-19 tests. Regarding BD Veritor, we've seen strong adoption and interest from both traditional and non-traditional accounts in the U.S. Since the last quarter, we have doubled our U.S. installed base of active Veritor Readers to over 50,000 units, and we continue to see strong instrument demand, further extending our footprint. We believe that this broadened Veritor footprint will provide us with additional future growth opportunities beyond COVID-19 testing for current and future planned assays. On September 30, we received the CE Mark for our COVID-19 assay on BD Veritor. And we've been very pleased with the reception of the assay in international markets. We've signed a number of contracts and are actively leveraging one of BD strengths, which is our large international footprint. And in fact, we are now shipping Veritor instruments and assays to customers across Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada. As we head into the flu season, we recently launched a combination COVID-19 flu RSV Test in Europe on our BD MAX system with our partner CerTest. We continue to work toward the launch of combination flu and COVID-19 assays on our BD MAX and BD Veritor platforms globally. Now let me take a minute and walk through our thinking on the outlook for Veritor. You've heard me say before that there are a number of variables at play. There's the ramp-up of our manufacturing, the number of competitive products and ASPs. And then you have to take into consideration many variables around COVID-19 vaccines, like their timing, availability, effectiveness, and how widely they are adopted. But taking all of that into consideration, we are comfortable forecasting fiscal 2021 Veritor testing in a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with the weighting of these revenues being more in the first half of the fiscal year than the second. I know many of you also have questions on the long-term durability of COVID-19 testing and the outlook for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Again, there are many factors at play and there are a variety of scenarios that we are planning for and we will be ready to execute. I would say though, that we do now believe that there is a higher likelihood for testing to continue into fiscal 2022. However, given the uncertainty around demands and ASPs, we believe it would not be prudent to model a continuation of revenues at the same level as fiscal 2021. This leads me to our next topic. Our COVID-19 testing reinvestment plans. We are electing to reinvest a portion of our FY2021 COVID-19 testing profits back into the business to ensure long-term durable growth. These profits will be invested consistent with our strategy and value creation framework of grow, simplify, and empower. Our top focus is investing in growth. We activated the organization and investment plan in Q4, initiating a bottoms up process to identify high impact projects and programs based on risk-adjusted returns and our capacity to execute. As part of this initiative, we increased investments in the recently launched BD Innovation and Growth Fund. We have also kick-started other programs that accelerate go-to-market investments in the U.S. and internationally and ongoing R&D projects. You've heard me talk about our simplification efforts around Project Recode. We plan to look for ways to optimize that program even more. We are also using COVID-19 profits to accelerate further investments in our Inspire Quality Program to enhance our risk management systems. We believe these investment programs should generate returns beginning in late FY2022. Our current reinvestment plans contemplate fiscal 2021 Veritor testing revenues of, as I said, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Veritor testing revenues are above this level, we plan to make additional investments towards long-term growth, yet still allow a portion of the higher revenues to flow through the bottom line. Next I'd like to take a moment to update you on our readiness for a COVID-19 vaccine campaign, where we continue to make great progress. To date, we now have commitments for over 800 million needles and syringes, which includes commitments from countries like the U.S., UK, and Canada and various non-government organizations around the world as they prepare for COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Last June, we estimated the total vaccine syringe and needle opportunity over a 12 to 18-month period could be in the $100 million to $150 million range and we continue to feel this is an achievable objective. Now I'd like to update you on Alaris. The highest priority of the organization continues to be preparing for a comprehensive 510(k) filing obtaining clearance for Alaris and returning our market-leading infusion pump franchise to growth. Over the last quarter, the team has made further progress and retired risk. We are systematically working our way through various testing stages, and we continue to engage in open dialogue with the FDA about our progress. My confidence level today is higher than it was last quarter, that we will be able to submit our 510(k) in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. As I mentioned in the past, our focus remains on ensuring a comprehensive submission that will ultimately help enable timely FDA review and clearance. While it was not our intention to predict the FDA's timelines, given the size and complexity of the submission, we do not assume any revenue contribution from a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2021. The last item on my hot list is I want to comment on innovation and our product pipeline. Category innovation remains one of the core drivers of our growth strategy. We have been focused on improving our pipeline execution and R&D effectiveness, and we continue to make great strides to that end. This quarter, R&D spending increased 8% year-over-year. The first meaningful increase for the company in many years. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on driving new innovation and a higher level of R&D investments, including through our new BD growth and innovation fund, which we established earlier this year. Through the fund, projects are funded for a maximum of two years and it would be completely new product development opportunities, unfunded or underfunded line extensions that have significant incremental revenue opportunities or commercial programs designed to accelerate product adoption. We received a lot of great submissions across all three segments and we initiated the first round of funding in Q4. Looking ahead to the next year or so, we are advancing a robust product portfolio with many singles and doubles like we've long been known for. We also have some more notable programs in the pipeline, and I'd like to highlight a few of those for you now. The IDS team is acutely focused on advancing our combination COVID and flu assays on both our BD Veritor and BD MAX platforms, as soon as possible for the benefit of patients. I also want to highlight the great strides of our Women's Health & Cancer franchise that they are making. In July, we received FDA approval of the BD Onclarity HPV Assay for extended genotyping, which can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management. We are receiving great customer feedback on this assay. And in fiscal 2021, we look forward to bringing this assay and BD COR, which is our new high throughput molecular diagnostic system with fully integrated specimen processing. We look forward to bringing that both of those to customers in the United States. The BD COR system and our Onclarity assay are both available in Europe, and we've been receiving very positive feedback on the initial rollout. In BD Medical in Q4, we launched the BD UltraSafe Plus 2.25mL passive safety system, which adds to our proven high-growth safety portfolio in Pharmaceutical Systems. It has been designed to deliver up to a two ml dose volume, while enabling an ergonomic and safe injection experience for both patients and healthcare providers. We have launched \u2013 we have secured a number of pharmaceutical partners that plan to commercially launch our new product towards the end of fiscal 2021. Also in BD Medical, during fiscal 2021, we will launch the BD Pyxis ES 1.7, which adds new capabilities and deeper integration of pharmacy and nursing by enhancing automation in the operating room with the Pyxis Anesthesia Station. In BD Interventional, we had a robust year of product launches across its three businesses. Of particular note, the Peripheral Intervention team launched the 0.18 and 300 millimeter LUTONIX DCBs in the U.S. and launched LUTONIX in Japan. PI also launched the elevation Single Insertion Multiple Sample Breast Biopsy device in addition to the Caterpillar Embolization device, which represents our first foray into the world of interventional oncology. Our Surgery business launched a completely robotic compatible version of our market-leading anatomically configured 3DMax Inguinal Hernia Mesh as well as the Pureprep Infection Prevention product. Finally, our UCC business capitalized on our developing position in female incontinence by launching drydock 2.0, which is designed to help women who suffer from incontinence to use PureWick at home. Fiscal 2021 promises to be another year of innovative product launches across the Interventional segment. The team worked hard to minimize the impact of COVID on our product launch schedule, leading to further commercialization of products across all businesses. For competitive reasons, we won't share any specifics with you, but suffice to say you should expect further commercialization activity of new products in our oncology, infection prevention and acute urology platforms in particular. Finally, I want to provide an update on our FDA PMA submission for the LUTONIX Drug Coated Balloon and its use in below the knee. The FDA has recently notified us that our PMA supplement remains non-approvable. We are working collaboratively with the FDA to determine what our next steps maybe, if any. As a reminder, our entire LUTONIX business today represents less than 1% of our overall sales, and we do not include any revenues in our forecast related to this submission. Before we move on, I want to take a moment and acknowledge John DeFord, who will retire from BD at the end of the calendar year. As you all know, John has had a remarkable career and has made a tremendous and lasting impact since joining BD three years ago. While he will continue to serve as an advisor and a consultant for us. Of course, we are going to miss John's leadership and we are going to miss his humor, but we are very excited for Patrick's appointment to the Chief Technology Officer. And we are confident that he is the right leader to deliver on our innovation strategy and product pipeline in our next phase of value creation. And as Patrick takes on this important new responsibility, we could not have asked for a better successor than Dave Hickey to lead BD Life Sciences and build on Patrick's track record of success. Dave has been leading the IDS team and the BD Veritor COVID-19 launch. Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our strategy. When I became CEO earlier this year, I outlined my vision for BD\u2019s next phase of value creation. It's what we call BD 2025, which included three drivers grow, simplify, and empower. And the drivers build upon BD strengths, our world-class manufacturing, global scale, our strong category leadership and deep capabilities in software and informatics. And we've made great progress in fiscal 2020 in building the foundation and beginning to execute against our new playbook. As I mentioned, we've been steadfast in strengthening our R&D capabilities and continuously improving our R&D effectiveness. And I'm excited about what is to come from the BD growth and innovation fund. We also look to augment our internal innovation strategy through tuck-in acquisitions. In fiscal 2020, we executed on six tuck-in transactions in higher growth markets, and I'll highlight just three. First is NAT Diagnostics, which is an early stage, privately held company, developing a molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care testing. This acquisition broadens our point-of-care testing capabilities in infectious disease. And while this product is still under development and a few years from launch, we are very excited about the technology and our point-of-care diagnostics business more broadly, and how this adds in a molecular capability to that. Another acquisition we closed on this year was Straub Medical, a privately held medical device company, that markets mechanical atherectomy and thrombectomy devices that treat peripheral arterial diseases. This acquisition expands our robust portfolio of PAD and Venous Solutions within our BD Interventional segment. And the third acquisition I'd like to highlight is Adaptec, an innovative startup company that developed Sensica UO, which is an automated urine output measurement solution. It captures hourly urine output measurements and integrate this into the electronic medical record through the BD HealthSight platform. This is actually going to be BD Interventional\u2019s first connected smart device, which leverages BD\u2019s interoperability position that we have today and about 70% of all U.S. hospitals. We have a robust funnel of deals and we continue to increase our focus here as we move into fiscal 2021. Our efforts around simplification and Project Recode and Inspire Quality, all remain on track. If anything, we have the opportunity to accelerate some projects with some of the COVID-19 test reinvestment proceeds. As I reflect on FY2020, I am proud of how the company worked to navigate through the headwinds of COVID and the Alaris ship hold. Our response to these challenges along with a successful launch of COVID-19 testing enabled BD to deliver flat revenue performance on an FX-neutral basis for the year. As I look ahead, there are some challenges that we face as a company, namely COVID and the Alaris remediation, the latter of which I am confident we will resolve. But there are many more opportunities ahead to drive growth and accelerate our impact on healthcare around the world. We have the right strategy. We're making the right investments. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Chris Reidy, and then I'll make a few concluding remarks.\nChristopher Reidy: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are pleased with our fiscal fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance. Overall revenues were $4.8 billion up 4.4% on both a reported and an FX-neutral basis. We estimate the net impact of COVID was a positive 210 basis points as COVID-19 testing revenue more than offset the ongoing negative impact from lower utilization across our businesses. Even after adjusting for the net COVID-19 effect, we are pleased that we're still able to grow our revenues despite the Alaris Pump ship hold. We estimate the negative impact of the Alaris ship hold was 240 basis points. BD Medical revenues totaled $2.3 billion and were down 4.9% year-over-year. We estimate COVID negatively impacted the business by about 370 basis points. We estimate the Alaris ship hold negative impact was 450 basis points. Medication Delivery Solutions saw sequential improvement consistent with healthcare utilization trends, but still continue to be impacted negatively by COVID-19 on a year-over-year basis. Internationally, MDS is declined, largely reflected the impact of China's volume-based procurement, as well as inventory reductions we took in the quarter. Medication Management Solutions, the Alaris ship hold continues to have a negative impact on the business units overall results and there was a difficult comparison with the prior year. International MMS sales were very strong driven by infusion pumps sales in Europe. In U.S. dispensing, we saw a solid growth and close the year with strong new committed contracts. In Diabetes Care, sales declines reflected ongoing market price pressures. Pharm System sales were up double-digits this quarter and ended the fiscal year with a strong 9.4% growth driven by our pre-filled and safety syringe portfolios. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion and were up 31.4%. We estimate the net positive impact of COVID was 26.2 percentage points in the quarter. Our Preanalytical Systems business was down 3% year-over-year. We have seen sequential improvement as routine lab testing volumes improved. Our Diagnostic Systems business was up 97.3% driven by just over 440 million in COVID-19 testing. Biosciences sales were down 9% globally. However, we saw a sequential improvement in reagent sales as research and testing continues to resume. BD Interventional revenues totaled just under $1 billion and were down 3.5% for the quarter. We estimate the net negative impact from COVID was 11.2 percentage points. Our Surgery and our Peripheral Intervention businesses, both saw a solid sequential improvements as elective procedures continue to return closer to pre-COVID levels in several geographies, most notably in the United States. The Peripheral Intervention business was particularly strong in Japan on the heels of a successful LUTONIX launch. The Urology and Critical Care business performed well with the U.S. returning to growth though offset by an international decline. Now turning to the P&L. Gross margins were 54.8% or 55.1% on an FXN basis, the latter down 200 basis points year-over-year. While we benefited from higher margin COVID-19 testing revenues, it was more than offset by the continued drag from lower volumes, which drove unfavorable manufacturing variances. We are actively managing our cash and inventory balances globally, and we expect to see more COVID-related manufacturing variances in fiscal 2021, negatively impacting our gross margin line. SSG&A expense of $1.2 billion was 25.1% of revenues up a 110 basis points year-over-year. SSG&A includes a $25 million investment to the BD Foundation this quarter in support of our longstanding commitment to advancing the world of health and supporting the communities where we live and work. We continue to see higher shipping costs related to the pandemic and we also had elevated levels of spend related to Veritor in the quarter. R&D expense of $279 million, representing 5.8% of revenues was up 20 basis points year-over-year. In dollar terms, spending was up 8% on a year-over-year basis as we invested in COVID diagnostics and other growth initiatives. We expect fiscal 2021 spending on R&D to continue to be higher as we continue to focus on innovation and implement some of the reinvestment plans, Tom mentioned earlier. Operating income was $1.1 billion resulting in an operating margin of 23.9%. On an FX-neutral basis, margins decreased 320 basis points, mainly reflecting the contractions in gross margin as well as higher SSG&A and R&D. Interest/other expense net was $110 million, resulting in a decline of $4 million on a year-over-year basis. We had favorability in interest expense this quarter as we repaid debt. The adjusted tax rate came in as expected in the high teens at 18.7%. Preferred dividends in the quarter were $22.8 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.79 as previously discussed and this includes a $0.02 headwind from FX. For the year, we generated $3.5 billion in cash flows from operations and our free cash flows were $2.7 billion net of $810 million in capital expenditures. In line with our goal of continuing to increase the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, we paid down $950 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our total debt repayment to $1.7 billion for the year. This resulted in a net leverage ratio of 3x \u2013 3.0x as of September 30, 2020. Now we wanted to share some broad thoughts on fiscal 2021. As we look ahead, the greatest uncertainty we see is the recent COVID-19 resurgences around the world and the potential impact this may have on general healthcare utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. Our guidance assumes no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Assuming no significant changes in utilization and procedure volumes associated with COVID-19 resurgences, we are comfortable forecasting low to mid single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth excluding the COVID testing revenues. Our COVID testing revenues in fiscal 2020 were approximately $580 million. On a total company level, inclusive of COVID testing, we expect FX-neutral revenues to grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 100 basis points to revenue growth on a reported basis. We expect our adjusted non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.40 to $12.60. Again, our guidance assumes no significant changes in utilization and procedure volumes associated with COVID-19 resurgences. This also does not assume any potential upside to our 1 billion to 1.5 billion in Veritor testing revenues. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, I want to point out some quarterly phasing, as you think about the upcoming year. Given that we are at September year end, we will not anniversary the initial COVID-19 impact into our fiscal Q3. In addition, U.S. biosciences also has difficult comparisons in fiscal Q1 due to licensing revenue in the prior year. And in Medication Management Solutions, our infusion business has tougher comparisons throughout the year, given the timing of the ship hold and shipments under medical necessity, as well as European sales related to COVID. As Tom mentioned earlier, we do not assume any revenues associated with the Alaris 510(k). However, offsetting these headwinds I just discussed, we would expect our COVID-19 testing revenues to be more heavily weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. In addition, we will anniversary the launch of our COVID testing in the fourth quarter. And taking all of the above into consideration and looking at the Street consensus, we would suggest a phasing that shifts earnings from Q4 into the first half of the year. I also want to take a moment to address FY2022 by making a few observations. Regarding our COVID-19 testing revenues, we see this as perhaps the biggest variable to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Depending on the level of success of Veritor in fiscal 2021, it could make for a difficult comparison to our revenues and earnings in fiscal 2022. And regarding Alaris, as Tom mentioned, we have a higher level of confidence today in our ability to submit the 510(k) at the end of fiscal Q2 2021 or early Q3. We would assume a contribution beginning sometime in fiscal 2022. Keep in mind, we ship pumps under medical necessity in fiscal 2020, thus, we would not necessarily assume there's a one-for-one pent-up demand when we obtain 510(k) clearance. Regarding the remainder of our business and assuming a more normal healthcare utilization environment, we would assume the business will return to an underlying mid single-digit growth rate in fiscal 2022. And with that, let's move on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nRobert Hopkins: Hi. Thank you, and good morning.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Bob.\nChristopher Reidy: Good morning, Bob.\nRobert Hopkins: Good morning. So just the \u2013 first question is maybe a clarification on the 2021 guide that you're giving. Can you just sort of sum all that up for us in terms of what does it imply for revenue dollars and how much it's assumed in there in terms of total COVID testing, not just Veritor? And then I know you said you're going to reinvest some of that. Like, what is sort of the, maybe the net EPS impact of COVID testing, including that reinvestment?\nThomas Polen: Yes. So on the issue of the guide related to \u2013 you know that we guided Veritor at $1 billion to $1.5 billion. When you add BD MAX, that's running at around 400 in that area, so you can add that on top of that.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. And then any clarity on just a thoughts on reinvestment, just trying to get a \u2013 because what we're trying to do obviously is get a sense of the underlying business versus \u2013 EPS contribution on the underlying business versus total testing. So what are the kind of reinvestment plans implied?\nThomas Polen: So the way to think about how much is within the $1 billion to $1.5 billion of revenue that we're forecasting. Our guidance assumes a certain amount of reinvestment of that. So not letting it all flow through. As you think about \u2013 if Veritors looking like it'll be above $1.5 billion, we would look to invest more than that going forward. And we would likely have some investment depending on the investments in the pipeline and we'll talk to that in a moment. And let some of it flow through to the bottom line as well. So we'll assess that as we're going through the year. But if it's over the $1.5 billion, we would look to invest more, but still allow a portion of that flow to the bottom line as well. \nChristopher Reidy: I think it's fair to say, we plan to reinvest among the initial $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. We're investing roughly 20% of the profits back into the business bump.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, David.\nDavid Lewis: Good morning, guys. How are you? So I appreciate. It's a very tight guidance in a very uncertain environment. I think a lot of investors will largely view this as a floor. But I did want to come back to the underlying business team one more time here. I think everyone's trying to compare the forward year 2021 to a base year, which is 2019, and I appreciate you all has a different comparisons there. But I think when people want to try to get to is if we take out some level of Veritor, we get to sort of some earnings number that's sort of in that 10, 10.50 range with reinvestment, maybe it's in 11 range. But if we look at the implied revenue growth 2021 over 2019, it's sort of low-single digits adjusted for pumps. And if we look at the margins, they seem kind of down in 2021 versus 2019. So for Tom and Chris, what investors want to hear is, it could be suggested that there's a problem in the underlying business or it could simply suggest that you're being conservative to begin the year. Help us understand the strength of that core business, and whether you think 2021 underlying margins can be up over the base year in 2019. And how you think that underlying business is sort of performing relative to that classic 5% BD growth rate that you're trying to get to? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nThomas Polen: Yes. David, good question. So I think if you look at it on an underlying basis, we are in that range that we're talking about that we've talked about around that 5% plus. We're in that. So if you look at we're in the low to mid-single digits in the core, of course, that has, and it maybe on that lower side of that. You've got the Alaris headwind, of course, which is still annualizing in the year as well. So that is a headwind that is built in to the core. If you take that out, you're back in right in that range that you mentioned before. So I'll let Chris add some more commentary on that. But just a reminder on that, we still do have annualization of the Alaris impact built into that.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. I would say David, the core is strong. You saw that in the fourth quarter as well. It's doing well. The margins are improving. To your point around the 2019 to 2021, there are a number of things. We are seeing synergies from the BARDA transaction over that period of time kicking in. Then obviously it's impacted. You have to take out the COVID impact, the drag, and then the add back for Veritor. But keep in mind, if we had a bit of a drag during that period in the China VBP and the Alaris, and when you adjust for that, we are seeing growth in the margins and feel very comfortable with the long-term view of the underlying 5% and 10% on the bottom, and that's very consistent with what we've seen.\nKristen Stewart: And David, the only thing I would add is that, our assumption is that we still are not getting back to a normalized level throughout fiscal 2021. So our guidance and margin forecast would still assume that the overall business continues to see headwinds on a margin perspective as we're still not back to pre-COVID levels overall.\nChristopher Reidy: I think to your point, we are looking \u2013 you're seeing some depression of the margins from the investments that we're making as well. So we're not letting it all flow through. We're making the investments that we outlined.\nDavid Lewis: Totally understand. So there's some COVID adjustment factor there. Okay. Very good. I think investors will appreciate that clarity. And then just Tom, as you think about COVID testing for next year, obviously it's for this year for you guys. First half, obviously hard and second half that's very consistent with some of the PCR providers have suggested in terms of what their assumptions are for peak testing. Can you sort of help us understand your capacity expansion plans sort of first half and second half, and what is embedded in terms of price pressure for next year and where's that coming from? And thanks so much.\nThomas Polen: Sure. Good questions, David. So as you think about what we've shared before, we shared 8 million tests per month by October, which we\u2019re in. 12 million tests per month starting in March of 2021, that's our capacity ramp on Veritor. And so those capacity plans remain firmly intact and so that's the basis of our outlook that we've shared. I made the comment, of course, we do continue to monitor the supply demand dynamics of the market, and we'll provide you with any updates on additional capacity expansions beyond that if we were to make those, but we won't provide those until that capacity were to come online. So that's just a little bit of background there. As we come to ASPs, we had said $20 ASP, we did a little bit better than that in Q4, as I mentioned. But we do expect to see pricing headwinds, ASP erosion, as there are more competitors in the market now than there were at the start of Q4. And we expect that there will be other entrance. And so we would expect that $20 ASP could come down as we move through the year. Okay. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Amit.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks. Good morning.\nChristopher Reidy: Good morning.\nAmit Hazan: Good morning. Just one clarification for this coming fiscal year on utilization. Can you just talk a little bit more to what you're assuming in the guidance for underlying hospital admissions and utilization versus what you've been seeing and what the impact would be, not just on BD Medical, but just on the entire business routine diagnostic testing as well.\nThomas Polen: Yes. Great question, Amit and good morning. So during the quarter, as I mentioned, we did observe sequential improvements across our businesses that are more elective procedure oriented, as well as in lab testing volumes. We saw them through the quarter evolve to around 90%. We've got \u2013 obviously we have access to some pretty unique information through our BD MedMined platform, which is in about 338 hospitals that gives us literally real time insights into hospital trends on inpatient admissions, ICU admissions, ER trends, ER outpatient versus inpatient, we can see that literally on a daily basis, what happened yesterday in these institutions, which are broadly distributed across the U.S. And so, as we look at that, we see hospital inpatient admissions trending around 85% to 90%, and we've posted some of this data in our deck so that we can share that more broadly. We thought there would be some information that you'd be interested in. So our projections and outlook do not assume any significant change to that on the positive nor on the downside as we think about the potential of a COVID resurgence. We do see, and as we talk to healthcare providers around the world, there's been a lot of preparation and learnings from the initial COVID surge, how to better keep facilities open, how to make patients more comfortable. We\u2019re still coming in for elective procedures. So I think we certainly don't expect that it would retrench back if there is a significant resurgence, retrench back to the lower utilization levels that we saw last year. But of course, that's difficult to predict, and it could be somewhere between where it is today and there could be, could it stay where it is, could be, could it get better if there's not a large resurgence could be. But we've taken a more moderate kind of middle of the road assumption that it will be relatively stable as it is today as we think about our forward-looking guidance.\nKristen Stewart: Simon, do you want to share some of your survey work that you've done through?\nSimon Campion: Yes. Just to back that, I think we shared some survey work on the August call, and we've repeated that survey work with about 600 physicians in our Surgery and PI business. And they are seeing volumes rebound I would say significantly, their capacity is at I think quite significant level compared to pre-COVID, their office-based volumes are increasing for the most part, so the funnel of patients is pretty robust. And there's still some \u2013 what we turn rollover patients as well that are in the mix of patients that were scheduled earlier this year, but have the procedure postponed. And so they're still in the mix as well. So it's pretty robust on the elective side right now.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks for the question Amit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for taking my question. And Chris, maybe on the guidance here. I guess if I just look at the gross COVID tailwinds, right, $1.5 billion at the high-end on Veritor, $400 million of MAX that's about $1.9 billion here. And I think we had somewhere something north of $600 million in 2020. So on a net basis we're looking at $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of net diagnostic tailwinds for fiscal 2021?\nChristopher Reidy: That\u2019s right.\nVijay Kumar: So you get high singles, you pick up high singles just on the tailwind. FX is another point, is that implying like the base is going to be flattish for next year. And the reason I ask is, you have $800 million of headwinds in 3Q. And assuming just to normalize this rate, shouldn't the base be up, contribute a few hundred basis points of topline next year?\nChristopher Reidy: No it doesn't imply that, we'd have to look at how you're doing the math, but it would imply more in that mid-single digits on the underlying ex-COVID testing. So thinking that 4% to 5% range, which is very healthy. We do still see the drag. As I pointed out in some of the prepared remarks, we see that tough compare in Alaris against the first quarter. We do still have the tough compare against the first half of the year in the base business until we overlap the COVID period, but then rebounding in the second half of the period. So when you cut through all of that you think in the mid-single digits for the underlying business.\nThomas Polen: I think that's just an important point to reiterate Vijay as Chris mentioned, right. Because of the timing of our fiscal year, we don't anniversary the lower utilization rates from a COVID impact until Q3, right. The first and second quarter, our compares are still at a pre-COVID basis of utilization. And so that obviously has an impact on that. And so it still be \u2013 even despite that in those mid-single digits, low-single digits, and the base business is actually quite strong.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then one quick on margins and free cash flows here. Maybe at [indiscernible], I just want to check if I'm doing the math right. Is the implied operating margins for fiscal 2021, is that that close to a 26.5% and free cash flow conversion where back to north of 90%, were there any timing impact or this now getting back to historical trends of BD printing north of 9% free cash conversion. Thank you.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. So we have to work with you on the math there too. But I think, what we're saying is if you use Q4 as a jumping off point of the year. We\u2019re likely to have some headwinds as we talked about. And we are making adjustments for the investments that we were talking about, what have you, Veritor does lift that. But taking all that into consideration, we would expect to see some good margin growth compared to the baseline of where we were in 2020. But it doesn't quite get to the 26 number that you're talking to.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. So just on the free cash Chris, was there any one-time effect?\nChristopher Reidy: I'm not sure what your question is there. We did give the free cash flow \u2013 what was your question on that Vijay?\nVijay Kumar: Where there any timing elements that benefit free cash flow or is this normalized free cash conversion metric, we should be looking forward to them?\nThomas Polen: Nothing looking forward, but obviously a lot of impacts throughout the year, lumpiness from the COVID drop through and what have you. We did a lot to offset that. We reduced the inventory levels as we talked about. So it did feel like a lot of lumpiness, but we were able to offset a good portion of the drag to be in a solid position as we exited the year. But going forward, I don't see anything that would be lumpy in nature.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nThomas Polen: Hey. Good morning, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: Hi, good morning. Two questions both on free cash flow and capital allocation. Maybe just to follow-up on Vijay\u2019s question. I think part of the question is there's a number of exclusions in the fiscal 2021 guidance that some of them appear to be cash exclusions. I just want to see \u2013 should free cash flow conversion next year take a step down on legal and some of those other items? Are there further offsets in the working capital to make it look more normal?\nChristopher Reidy: Good question, Robbie. So, no, I think some of the cash impacts that we consider kind of below the line or having the past been integration spending in EUMDR. Those were the biggest ones. And the integration spending has been \u2013 will be lower going into 2021. EUMDR is still with us. We continue to invest to make sure we're in good shape with the regulations there. So there will be a portion of that, but the free cash flow conversion will increase in 2021.\nRobert Marcus: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe a broader question just on your theory and thought process behind guidance. I don't envy you having to give guidance here in the middle of the pandemic for forward 12 months. We've seen guidance that we've had a lot of beats, but then lowered guidance over time. How did you approach fiscal 2021 guidance here? What ends up to be a pretty narrow range? How should we assume \u2013 what's your tolerance levels around it? What were some of just the strategic thinking that you and the Board did? And I'm really trying to get at how confident are you that this is more of a floor and a beatable target rather than it could be better, could be worse in certain areas. Thanks.\nChristopher Reidy: Sure. It\u2019s a great question. Obviously, we've been following things very, very closely. We do see, as we said sequential improvement in our businesses. And so we took that into account. Obviously we're watching the potential for a resurgence very closely. And I think we were very clear when we gave the guidance that we're not assuming a major resurgence that would have a big impact on utilization and in elective surgeries. So we are not assuming that. And that's something that we'll have to wait and see. But at the same time, as we look at the course of the business and the way hospital systems are able to handle the current level, that gives us a certain amount of comfort and visibility as we go forward. I think the other thing that we have in here is the fact that Veritor gives us some natural offset if there is some level of utilization impact, it would probably go hand in hand over the course of the year with a bit more incremental Veritor testing. So there's some opportunity there. And obviously we have built in some piece of our investment of the Veritor revenues and we can gate that to some extent. And so with all of those things, we felt comfortable again, assuming that there's no major change in the resurgence that we could achieve the guidance that we gave.\nRobert Marcus: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of questions on Veritor testing. I'll kind of rapid fire a couple of these. So first are you guys looking to kind of expand your offering there? And are you thinking about anything on the non-instrumented side? And then you mentioned that you doubled the installed base here recently to over 50,000 units. Does that include the roughly 11,000 into the nursing homes? And I'm curious what the utilization you would expect in total for Veritor post-pandemic in order to help us gauge the long-term value creation that you're driving there. So a few on Veritor. Thanks.\nThomas Polen: Yes. Good questions, Brian. So the double install base of over 50,000 does include those that have been put in the nursing home. As I mentioned, we are looking at what additional menu we can put on that platform. We have a number of opportunities that we think are pretty exciting. Of course, we've never had an install base in the nursing home segment itself. And so part of that work that we've done is actually identifying what specific assays are relevant to the nursing home segment. There's other segments that we now have Veritor placements, and we wouldn't have looked at before in terms of \u2013 is there some unique menu that is more relevant to these segments that haven't been traditional call points for us. And so we're actually just wrapping up. We've just wrapped up that work. And again, we'll be using. That'll be an area of investment is in additional menu expansion on Veritor, where you reinvest some of those profits to add additional menu that we think are relevant to some of the new call points that we have Veritor placed in. So we see longevity there beyond the COVID-19 testing itself. Of course, as you know, we are expanding the menu there, very actively working on our COVID-19 flu assay. As we've always said, we\u2019ll provide timing on that when we're ready to \u2013 when we get EUA, and we launched that same thing on BD MAX beyond the assay that we've already launched in Europe with our partner CerTest. So we feel really good about the momentum on Veritor. We hear great feedback from our customers on that. And again, we do see longevity on the install base, not only for COVID-19, which as I mentioned before. We think we'll have more longevity. If you ask me this time last quarter, said how much testing is going to happen in FY2022? I would just say that I feel more confident today that there will be longer testing runway beyond 2021 of COVID testing into 2022 and potentially beyond. Obviously then our work on adding menu to that will prolong the growth opportunities for Veritor beyond the COVID window. Thanks Brian for the call. Go ahead.\nBrian Weinstein: Yes. Obviously, is there anything on the non-instrumental? Or are you guys looking to develop anything that would be an antigen test that would not be on the Veritor platform? \nThomas Polen: Yes. We're looking at that Brian. And again, if we decide to do that, we'll share that when we're ready to launch it. But I would just say at this point, particularly in developed markets, we are very confident in the value that the instrumented platform brings. Again, just as a reminder, our instrumented platform is at a very different cost base than most any other instrumented platform right in that $250, $300 range. So it's not a significant capital, it\u2019s not a challenge for any customer when it comes to that. It wouldn't even be a challenge significantly to bring it into the home necessarily, and we get the benefits, right. Remember, we\u2019re one of the original inventors of lateral flow testing. Our first technologies were manual as we're all, and all of those technologies move to instrumented platforms because they got higher performance on flu and RSV and COVID is of course even a more critical assay to get right. And we see the benefits of an instrumented platform when it comes to sensitivity specificity. We still believe strongly in that. We continue \u2013 you've seen us put out a number of \u2013 support a number of publications, whether or not it's comparisons of technologies or recent publication, you probably saw around the role of antigen testing versus molecular testing when it comes to projecting infectivity, and that was relative to cell culture methods, which are the reference for, I believe that for patient to be infective. So we're going to continue to invest very heavily behind scientific evidence, and you can expect more of that from us. Again, it would support the value of Veritor and the technology that we're deploying.\nBrian Weinstein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.\nThomas Polen: Hey, Larry. Good morning.\nChristopher Reidy: Good morning, Larry.\nLawrence Keusch: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. I guess, first, Tom for you. You obviously said in a couple of spots during the call that you are more confident in the timing for the filing of the Alaris 510(k). So just again, want to get a little sense of what makes you more confident than where we were three months ago? Is it just \u2013 again, you've knocked off some of the key objectives there that we're in the way. And as part of that question, given some of the hardware recalls that you've had recently. How does that get handled? Does that have to find its way into a filing as well? And then I guess, Chris for you, obviously heard the commentary around pulling some of the 4Q for 2021 into the first half as you talked about the various headwinds and tailwinds. As you look at the first quarter numbers that are out there for the consensus, do you have any \u2013 just any high-level thoughts as sort of how those feel?\nThomas Polen: Good questions, Larry. So when it comes to \u2013 let me take the first two and then I'll turn it over to Chris for the third. So in terms of what gives us more confidence, I think you nailed it. It's the fact that we are systematically working our way through the various testing stages. And so we've completed that much more testing since the last update. And that gives us confidence. We also continue to have very active and ongoing dialogue with the FDA around our progress. And that's why as I made earlier, we do have greater confidence in the timelines that we\u2019ve shared last, which is late Q2, early Q3 of this fiscal year. When it comes to the hardware recalls, that's really part of our remediation of the Alaris franchise. It\u2019s us looking at all the different complaint history and are there any further improvements we can be making to the platform. That's also part of our 43 response and activities. And so there's no other filings or anything, those are all built into the current 510(k) submission work. They do not have any impact on the timing of the 510(k) submissions.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. And then in terms of your question regarding the phasing, I'd say we commented in our prepared remarks that as we looked at the consensus, we did feel that consensus was a bit high in Q4. We wanted to correct that and that we think that some of that should be moved to the first half. I would say move a little bit more of that to the Q2 then to Q1, but Q1 is a bit light given what we're looking at. And so we just wanted to kind of get the quarterly phasing right up front out of the box as we enter the year. And so that's why we were very specific around, take it out of the fourth quarter, put it in the first half. And I would add a little bit more in Q2 than Q1.\nLawrence Keusch: Okay. Terrific. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Larry.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. One on international, one on fiscal 2022, we heard a lot of good color commentary on this call that what you're seeing in the U.S., but obviously we're seeing things deteriorate in places like Europe. How do your comments about the COVID impact in the U.S. compared to what you're seeing outside the U.S., and I have one follow-up.\nThomas Polen: Yes. So we're seeing still strong performance in Asia in terms of utilization. We're seeing very strong control of COVID across pretty much all Asian nations at this point. But as you mentioned Europe, we are seeing quarantine measures tighten. I would say that \u2013 again, European countries are much better prepared this time to continue to deliver care through that period of time. Can there be an impact on procedure volumes as we look forward? Yes. Out of Europe, it may be slightly less prepared, obviously there's different factors in public versus private healthcare systems as well that influenced that. But I think from what we're seeing now, we're definitely seeing better management and continued use of procedures early in this resurgence. But again, that's one of the caveats that we had to make. We can't predict the extent of everything on a forward-looking basis. And so our assumptions, we do recognize that particularly in Europe, there can be some increase, but if it's a significant increase, that would be something that\u2019s not in our current assumptions.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for that, Tom. Chris, in your prepared remarks, you gave some good color on fiscal 2022. I heard that 5% plus topline growth and double-digit EPS growth, the algorithm, it sounds like you expect to return there in fiscal 2022, but in your prepared remarks, I heard kind of topline on an underlying basis. So I'm assuming you kind of want us to adjust for the COVID testing delta there. But I didn't hear anything on how to think about EPS. Should the starting point be the guidance you gave for $12.40 to $12.60, or is there some different way we should be thinking about EPS growth beyond fiscal 2021? Thanks for taking the question.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. I think you got \u2013 for the most part, I think you are talking about it, right. Obviously, we feel good about \u2013 there's going to be a lot of movement in 2022 from a number of things on the topline. And the biggest variable obviously is what happens to Veritor and you heard Tom say, that we feel better about the testing going into 2022, but we've also said it wouldn't be prudent to assume the same level of testing in 2022 from 2021. And we'll obviously update you as we go from quarter-to-quarter. But you would expect to see some drop off in that piece. And obviously that slope, whether it's a cliff, it doesn't look like it's a cliff in 2022 right now. But it's certainly a downward slope as we think about it. And some of what we're doing in terms of the investing of Veritor spending will help mitigate some of that slope to a certain extent. So we're watching that very closely. But as we look at it, the other variable is when does Alaris revenues start coming back to pre-ship hold kind of levels. And we were very clear. We did not include anything in our 2021 guidance for that. And we're not predicting where that's going to be in 2022, but at some point 2022, we would expect that to start kicking back in. It's probably not as big a pent-up demand because of the medical necessity amounts that we've had in 2020 and potentially into 2021. But those are the things to keep in mind. But we do feel that the base business in 2022 on an underlying basis will be very solid and continue to be solid. So that's just some ways to think about it.\nThomas Polen: And then maybe Larry, this is Tom. Let me just maybe add on a little bit to Chris's good comments there. I'd say what you're seeing us do is from in the face of a pandemic and the utilization impact, you're seeing us work our way back to that driving durable, sustainable growth, right. We all recognize the markets are anything but predictable. And we worked hard \u2013 your earlier question was, spend a lot of time thinking about that range, you can debate and should you have a wide range or a narrower range that at least keeps people from getting on either end of it, which is where we ended up at. But we believe we\u2019ve executed well against challenges in remarkable times. So you can see us doing that as we offset the COVID headwinds this quarter. And I think if you take, for example, this year, in our worst months, we saw significant headwinds across our business. We develop COVID testing. We saw the return of procedures, and we turn a negative headwind into a tailwind, and we showed mid-single digits growth. If you think about prior to COVID, we thought about our end markets growing about 4% and our investments in R&D being in higher growth markets and select investments in tuck-in M&A further supplementing that growth. We feel still strong about that path forward to 5% plus growth that you\u2019ve heard me talk about. And of course, what we're doing now is, this year, in fact with Veritor of course, we're going to be nearly double that level. But what we're doing is we're taking a portion of those profits and we're further investing in our growth and innovation fund. We're investing behind further growth opportunities and right, we're continuing that work on accelerating inorganic innovation or our tuck-in M&A. Again, all in the spirit of driving that durability and consistency of our growth profile. So just to summarize that, we feel good about our capabilities, our innovation, and the factors that are in our control as we think about the business going forward.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks so much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: Good morning, everybody.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Rick.\nFrederick Wise: Nothing else is clear. It's very clear that innovation is a top priority for you. And one element of that as you discussed is R&D spending, and you emphasize strongly the 8% growth there. So my question really is how do we think about R&D going forward? I mean, you've historically or in recent years has been more around that plus or minus 6% of sales range. Are you suggesting that I mean, that we should think about that either as a percentage of sales or growth as meaningfully higher going forward? Just again any perspective there would be great. Thank you.\nThomas Polen: Let me comment on just at a high level perspective and then turn it to Chris to talk about kind of how we think about it within the P&L. So obviously you're going to see R&D at, what we'll call higher than a normalized level in 2021 because of the reinvestment of the Veritor proceeds. I would expect it to see that. Of course, as I mentioned, that 8% growth that you saw in Q4 were coming off of relatively flat R&D growth over the last five, six years during the synergy window. And so it is \u2013 as you mentioned, it's a notable step up and we will be continuing to increase R&D because of not just our base strategy has that in it, but we're using this opportunity to reinvest those Veritor proceeds and leveraging that growth and innovation fund and the way that we're selecting incremental projects through that process, which was a process that was very successful, obviously at BARDA and the John has helped implement here at BD. So as we think about going forward on the P&L beyond what we're going to see in 2021, I'll turn that over to Chris. But you would expect to see R&D growing in line with revenue on a forward basis beyond 2021, at least in that level.\nChristopher Reidy: Sure. So what I would say and reemphasize, we clearly are, as you said, focus on innovation, and you would expect R&D to increase. You're absolutely right that we did emphasize that 8% growth year-over-year because we need to get back to that 6% mark. We had fallen below that over the last few years, and it's important that we get back there. I think that is probably a good proxy for 2021 to use because that 6% is off of a much higher revenue base as well. So from a dollar standpoint, that's a pretty big step up. So that's a good proxy to think about is that 6% of revenue going forward.\nFrederick Wise: Thank you. And just last for me. First, just want to make sure I understood. I don't think you said \u2013 what assumptions are you making about flu as you give us your first half and fiscal 2021 projections. And just last, Chris, congratulations, leveraged down to 3x. Is that where you both want to be? Where are we heading? Just help us think through at a high level your balance sheet goes as well. Thanks so much.\nThomas Polen: Yes. Great question. And let me take the first one on flu and then Chris on leverage. So flu is certainly light in the Southern hemisphere, so it's unclear what the impact will be this season. I think for us, COVID obviously overwhelms the whole thing. I mean, we're selling every Veritor test we can make. So the whole balance between are we making Veritor tests or COVID tests. We're selling at this point obviously a lot of COVID tests. We are making flu tests and we are shipping flu tests. But if flu tests aren't being utilized that level, we'll make more COVID tests at least for the first couple of quarters. And then obviously we do have a combination assay in development that we look forward to launching later this year. And again, we'll give more color on that. So I think it is fair to say that, I mean, the reality is, is if people are isolated more and are wearing masks and are doing things, will there be a lighter flu season in the Northern hemisphere as well, logic would say so, but the impacts on our business, I think will be different this year because of the role of COVID and the presence of COVID.\nChristopher Reidy: And I would say in terms of the 3x leverages, we're proud that we got down to 3.0x this past quarter on a net basis. And as we've always said, that was the initial commitment, but then we would expect that to continue to float down with increasing EBITDA as we go forward. And so that is still the commitment. We wouldn't want to operate just at the 3x level. We think a company like ours should be in that 2.5-ish kind of range at least. And so we would expect that to float down that way over time.\nFrederick Wise: Thanks so much.\nThomas Polen: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Jason.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is [Jerome] for Jason. Thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to refer back to a slide you guys have in your deck where you point out that procedures that rarely trended above that 100% of normal range. Obviously pretty interesting data set. Just wondering if you had any feedback on whether that would be primarily related to patient willingness or challenges of processing those patients through the hospital. And then I guess, any thoughts on the relative outperformance of the inpatient versus outpatient as it seems to show?\nKristen Stewart: Yes, it's Kristen. Just to comment on that. I mean, we don't have any further data on this. It's just come from the MedMined dataset, we will say just obviously anecdotally just because of the data that we see, which is the data that you see. Certainly, I would say that there has been general apprehensiveness around patients going into care settings in the United States, which this is. This is a dataset of 338 U.S. hospitals. Just to be clear, this is a U.S. dataset. So that likely is influencing some of the trends here.\nThomas Polen: Maybe Simon as well.\nSimon Campion: Yes. Thanks, Tom. And again, referring to that survey that we've just completed. Certainly, the majority of physicians we spoke to reflected on patient sentiment being one of the driving factors moving here. And some significant data came out about the oncology patient set, breast cancer and colon patients in particular. The decline in screening that's happened in the early phase of COVID is going to contribute to an extra 36,000 deaths \u2013 33,000 deaths in the U.S. from cancer because of a lack of screening in the early phases of COVID. And so as you walk around different cities in the U.S. and certainly where I live in Rhode Island, you see billboards now with hospitals and practices encouraging patients to go attend. And I think the protocols that they've implemented are certainly establishing great framework for patients to feel comfortable about it. But still, I think hospitals want to do procedures, physicians want to do them, and the big variable here is getting the patients back in for screening and subsequent procedures after that.\nThomas Polen: Thanks for the questions, Jerome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nThomas Polen: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Taylor: Hey. Good morning, Tom and Chris. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to ask you about the forward years. You made some comments before. I guess what I'm wondering is if there is a testing cliff at some point if you have a tough compare, are there things that you would do proactively like a buyback or you phase down some of those investments that you're making now in growth to kind of smooth earnings and help with that transition?\nChristopher Reidy: Sure. Great question. And thanks to allow us to add some clarity there. That's exactly the thought process. As we initially looked at this, we thought that it could be very much a cliff from 2021 to 2022, and that one way to mitigate that, that cliff would be to make investments in 2021 that help us drive long-term growth, but also are kind of one-year investment boluses that will kind of mitigate that cliff to a certain extent. That logic still continues as we think about testing extending into 2022 because it wouldn't be characterized, as I said by a cliff, but it certainly the potential for a downward slope. And by making some of these investments in 2021, it would help mitigate that slope to a certain extent. The biggest variable is what that slope looks like. But I think we're very comfortable that we can do that in 2021, and then see where that testing in 2022 is going. So it's looking less like a cliff. Those investments certainly are the kinds of investments that we could make. That would be an expense in 2021, but not only would go away in 2022, but would potentially drive increases in 2022 in earnings by investing in a variety of things, R&D, M&A kind of deals that become more accretive in year two, that kind of thing. So it's exactly what your question implies what we're doing.\nThomas Polen: Thanks for the question, Matt.\nMatthew Taylor: Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Tom. I just had one follow-up on the pricing in testing. Have you actually seen any price pressure yet, or is this just something that you're thinking could happen and so you're being conservative in baking in some potential pressure for Veritor especially?\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. It's still latter. We haven't seen the pressure yet. But as Tom mentioned, I think earlier in Q4 the ASP was a bit higher than we had signaled. But we don't think it's prudent to continue to think that that would hold up as other competitors move into the market and the different dynamics that we'll be facing as we go throughout the year. So we had originally signaled the $20 ASP and we think it was \u2013 it certainly was higher than that in our Q4. But we think that will be under pressure as we go through, and that is what we have in our guidance assumptions.\nMatthew Taylor: Great. Thank you.\nKristen Stewart: And Crystal, we'll take just one more question just given the time, apologies to those left in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nThomas Polen: Good morning. Josh.\nJoshua Jennings: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you maybe able to share just the percentage of the revenue base levered to hospital's capital equipment budgets. And if you could talk about just the recovery of the capital franchise maybe hard to parse out lot of moving pieces with Veritor instrument placements and the Alaris ship hold. But anything you can share just about those non-Veritor instrument and Alaris Pumps, but on the \u2013 the rest of the capital franchise recovered in fiscal 4Q and the outlook for the chunk of the revenue base in fiscal 2021.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. And this is consistent with what we've said in the past. The percentage of revenue that are focused on capital is in that kind of 15%-ish range. We've said that in the past. And you might imagine where that is. It's in, in areas like KIESTRA and in the M&A side for the most part, a little bit in Biosciences. We have seen pressure on capital during the third quarter, particularly and we have seen that improve. A lot of it has to do with the inability to install during the third quarter because hospitals weren't allowing people to come in that were not patients appropriately. So we did see that pressure, we saw that sequentially improve into Q4. And so we would expect that to continue to improve through 2021 as well, and we don\u2019t \u2013 assuming that there's no major resurgence. As we said, our guidance contemplates that assuming and being at normal levels in 2021.\nThomas Polen: I would say that \u2013 as we \u2013 we did see some improvements on the capital in the research area, BDB, we saw it across the Board. I\u2019d say dispensing is another area, obviously capital part of that\u2019s operating leases. We still do sell some in capital. But I\u2019d comment, we did see the U.S. dispensing business returned to the modest growth in Q4. And we ended the year with strong net gains and committed contracts with a very strong Q4 in committed contracts and we ended the year net positive there from a competitive perspective as well. So we're seeing good signs there. As you mentioned, it's a little bit difficult with Alaris to fully compare that, but we were seeing the restarting of it, and we\u2019re able to get back into labs now to do those installations, the Kiestra installation. There is a big complex, those are big complex walls, change electricity sockets, but they weren't happening throughout the pandemic that are restarting now.\nJoshua Jennings: Great. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up. Just on the \u2013 LUTONIX is a small piece of the overall corporate revenue pie. But a little bit more important for the Interventional segment. The VOYAGER PAD Analysis at TCT was probably the most compelling rebuttal of the Katsanos Meta-Analysis. Maybe you could help us or give an update on the state of affairs of the drug-coated balloon market, and relative to the high watermark in 2018. And really just \u2013 my questions is just trying to get a sense of with this VOYAGER PAD data out there, the other data sets that have been presented over the last 12 months, I mean, could LUTONIX from where it sits today, become a growth driver for Interventional over the next 12 to 24 months. Thanks for taking the questions.\nSimon Campion: Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Simon. As I think over the past pre-COVID, certainly we had seen a, I think a significant rebound in our LUTONIX business in or around the 70% to 80% of Q1 2019 numbers, so before Katsanos, and so on. Over the past several months or Q3 was our Q3, that obviously deteriorated quite a lot. But I'd say coming out of September, we were pretty much at the pre-COVID levels, which were in that 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels. That's all making sense. And again, some recent work that we've done a year ago and I just repeated, a year ago about 80% of physicians that we surveyed were less than comfortable with Paclitaxel safety based on Katsanos and based on the FDA panel and so on and so forth. And now that has flipped. The recent data that we got that has flipped that 80% are now comfortable with Paclitaxel safety and the VOYAGER data, and the data that was provided at panel and so on and so forth. I think that reiterate the safety of Paclitaxel in general and LUTONIX specifically. So it was a significant driver for us in Q4. In the peripheral business, both domestically and in Japan where we've had a really successful launch since we commercialized fully in December. And we continue to get FDA approvals on the 018 platform, and the 300 millimeter balloon platform and the low profile AV platform. So we're pretty pleased with where we are right now on LUTONIX.\nJoshua Jennings: Okay. Thanks.\nThomas Polen: Thank you for the question.\nThomas Polen: So thanks everyone for the good dialogue this morning. We've shared with you the challenges, opportunities, and successes that shaped Q4 and fiscal 2020, and that are influencing our expectations for the year ahead. One thing we didn't talk about though, were the people of BD, the 70,000 associates around the globe, who rallied around our purpose of advancing the world of health at a time when the need was most urgent. So I want to close with a message to the BD team. Thank you for your focus on our purpose, for your resilience when it came to executing our most critical priorities and your willingness to embrace bold new ideas, you delivered a strong Q4 that exceeded our expectations to finish a trying year on a high note. By building on the bold actions we took in FY2020, and by continuing to execute our long-term strategy to grow, simplifying and empower, we will address healthcare's immediate needs while bringing more innovative new solutions that will support our growth across all three of our segments. In FY2021, there will be no shortage of opportunities for you to think boldly make a meaningful impact and change more lives for the better. On behalf of the entire executive team, I want to say thank you to BD associates around the world for your efforts, sacrifices, and achievements over the past year. You showed the world and each other just how vital BD is to the delivery of healthcare. Thanks again, and let's keep going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristen. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well, and thank you for joining us. For today's call, I want to address three main topics. First, my high level perspective on the quarter and full-year performance; second, I'll give an update on several hot topics we're fully focused on; and finally, I will share progress on BD strategy. Then I'll turn it over to Chris for a review of the P&L and an update on our outlook. So let's jump right in. First, I'll start with the quarter and the full-year performance. In Q4, we had better-than-expected revenue and not only our COVID-related diagnostics testing, but also our core business that allowed us to not only deliver EPS upside, but also importantly gave us the opportunity to make some strategic investments aligned to our BD 2025 growth strategy. Revenues were up 4.4% on a reported and FX-neutral basis as we were able to offset the overall impact of COVID-19 and grew despite the Alaris ship hold. I want to acknowledge the exceptional execution by our Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business this quarter, particularly the BD Veritor team. The team exceeded our commitments, successfully developing the BD Veritor COVID-19 assay in an accelerated timeframe, securing several regulatory approvals, scaling up manufacturing and continuing to advance the science behind the utility and effectiveness of rapid antigen point-of-care testing. Total COVID-19 testing revenues allowed us to offset the ongoing COVID headwinds and other businesses from lower hospital utilization, surgical procedures, routine lab testing volumes, and research spending. In fact, because of our COVID testing revenues, we were able to move from a net negative COVID impact in Q3 to a net positive COVID impact in Q4. If you exclude COVID-19 testing and look at performance of the base businesses, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement across all of our three segments during the quarter. As you would expect, the pace of the recovery varied by both product category and by geography. So all in, the BD team was able to deliver Q4 mid single-digit sales growth, overcoming the headwinds from COVID-19 and the Alaris ship hold, the latter we estimate to be 240 basis points in the quarter. Our Q4 adjusted EPS was $2.79 down 15.7% on a year-over-year basis. While our revenues returned to growth, we did continue to see some COVID-related pressure, dilution from our May equity issuance and headwinds from the last quarter of the Gore royalty contributed to our EPS decline. As I look back on the year, we faced a number of challenges from the Alaris ship hold to COVID-19 and its significant impact on healthcare utilization globally. In our fiscal Q3, COVID-19 had about a $600 million negative impact to our topline. However, the BD team executed strongly, swiftly launching multiple innovative COVID-19 diagnostic solutions and focusing on execution to return to growth in Q4 and finished the year with revenues flat on an FX-neutral basis. I'm proud of the team for their hard work, closing the year strong and offsetting the continued COVID-19 headwinds. Now I want to turn to several hot topics. Let's start with review of our COVID testing in the quarter. As I said, I was very pleased with the IDS team's execution this quarter with COVID-19 testing sales coming in at approximately $440 million with Veritor revenues at over $340 million in the quarter. We are able to ramp-up Veritor manufacturing capacity faster than originally expected, a testament to BD's world-class manufacturing excellence. We're also able to sustain a higher average selling price for longer than we anticipated. Looking ahead, we do expect price erosion as additional competitors have come to market and more may do some. We continue to work diligently to expand our BD Veritor and BD MAX manufacturing capacity. Our previously communicated capacity expansions remain firmly intact. We continue to monitor the supply and demand dynamics of the market. And we'll provide you with updates on additional capacity expansions to the extent any further new capacity comes online. On the customer side, we continue to see very strong demand for BD Veritor and BD MAX COVID-19 tests. Regarding BD Veritor, we've seen strong adoption and interest from both traditional and non-traditional accounts in the U.S. Since the last quarter, we have doubled our U.S. installed base of active Veritor Readers to over 50,000 units, and we continue to see strong instrument demand, further extending our footprint. We believe that this broadened Veritor footprint will provide us with additional future growth opportunities beyond COVID-19 testing for current and future planned assays. On September 30, we received the CE Mark for our COVID-19 assay on BD Veritor. And we've been very pleased with the reception of the assay in international markets. We've signed a number of contracts and are actively leveraging one of BD strengths, which is our large international footprint. And in fact, we are now shipping Veritor instruments and assays to customers across Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada. As we head into the flu season, we recently launched a combination COVID-19 flu RSV Test in Europe on our BD MAX system with our partner CerTest. We continue to work toward the launch of combination flu and COVID-19 assays on our BD MAX and BD Veritor platforms globally. Now let me take a minute and walk through our thinking on the outlook for Veritor. You've heard me say before that there are a number of variables at play. There's the ramp-up of our manufacturing, the number of competitive products and ASPs. And then you have to take into consideration many variables around COVID-19 vaccines, like their timing, availability, effectiveness, and how widely they are adopted. But taking all of that into consideration, we are comfortable forecasting fiscal 2021 Veritor testing in a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with the weighting of these revenues being more in the first half of the fiscal year than the second. I know many of you also have questions on the long-term durability of COVID-19 testing and the outlook for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Again, there are many factors at play and there are a variety of scenarios that we are planning for and we will be ready to execute. I would say though, that we do now believe that there is a higher likelihood for testing to continue into fiscal 2022. However, given the uncertainty around demands and ASPs, we believe it would not be prudent to model a continuation of revenues at the same level as fiscal 2021. This leads me to our next topic. Our COVID-19 testing reinvestment plans. We are electing to reinvest a portion of our FY2021 COVID-19 testing profits back into the business to ensure long-term durable growth. These profits will be invested consistent with our strategy and value creation framework of grow, simplify, and empower. Our top focus is investing in growth. We activated the organization and investment plan in Q4, initiating a bottoms up process to identify high impact projects and programs based on risk-adjusted returns and our capacity to execute. As part of this initiative, we increased investments in the recently launched BD Innovation and Growth Fund. We have also kick-started other programs that accelerate go-to-market investments in the U.S. and internationally and ongoing R&D projects. You've heard me talk about our simplification efforts around Project Recode. We plan to look for ways to optimize that program even more. We are also using COVID-19 profits to accelerate further investments in our Inspire Quality Program to enhance our risk management systems. We believe these investment programs should generate returns beginning in late FY2022. Our current reinvestment plans contemplate fiscal 2021 Veritor testing revenues of, as I said, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Veritor testing revenues are above this level, we plan to make additional investments towards long-term growth, yet still allow a portion of the higher revenues to flow through the bottom line. Next I'd like to take a moment to update you on our readiness for a COVID-19 vaccine campaign, where we continue to make great progress. To date, we now have commitments for over 800 million needles and syringes, which includes commitments from countries like the U.S., UK, and Canada and various non-government organizations around the world as they prepare for COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Last June, we estimated the total vaccine syringe and needle opportunity over a 12 to 18-month period could be in the $100 million to $150 million range and we continue to feel this is an achievable objective. Now I'd like to update you on Alaris. The highest priority of the organization continues to be preparing for a comprehensive 510(k) filing obtaining clearance for Alaris and returning our market-leading infusion pump franchise to growth. Over the last quarter, the team has made further progress and retired risk. We are systematically working our way through various testing stages, and we continue to engage in open dialogue with the FDA about our progress. My confidence level today is higher than it was last quarter, that we will be able to submit our 510(k) in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. As I mentioned in the past, our focus remains on ensuring a comprehensive submission that will ultimately help enable timely FDA review and clearance. While it was not our intention to predict the FDA's timelines, given the size and complexity of the submission, we do not assume any revenue contribution from a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2021. The last item on my hot list is I want to comment on innovation and our product pipeline. Category innovation remains one of the core drivers of our growth strategy. We have been focused on improving our pipeline execution and R&D effectiveness, and we continue to make great strides to that end. This quarter, R&D spending increased 8% year-over-year. The first meaningful increase for the company in many years. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on driving new innovation and a higher level of R&D investments, including through our new BD growth and innovation fund, which we established earlier this year. Through the fund, projects are funded for a maximum of two years and it would be completely new product development opportunities, unfunded or underfunded line extensions that have significant incremental revenue opportunities or commercial programs designed to accelerate product adoption. We received a lot of great submissions across all three segments and we initiated the first round of funding in Q4. Looking ahead to the next year or so, we are advancing a robust product portfolio with many singles and doubles like we've long been known for. We also have some more notable programs in the pipeline, and I'd like to highlight a few of those for you now. The IDS team is acutely focused on advancing our combination COVID and flu assays on both our BD Veritor and BD MAX platforms, as soon as possible for the benefit of patients. I also want to highlight the great strides of our Women's Health & Cancer franchise that they are making. In July, we received FDA approval of the BD Onclarity HPV Assay for extended genotyping, which can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management. We are receiving great customer feedback on this assay. And in fiscal 2021, we look forward to bringing this assay and BD COR, which is our new high throughput molecular diagnostic system with fully integrated specimen processing. We look forward to bringing that both of those to customers in the United States. The BD COR system and our Onclarity assay are both available in Europe, and we've been receiving very positive feedback on the initial rollout. In BD Medical in Q4, we launched the BD UltraSafe Plus 2.25mL passive safety system, which adds to our proven high-growth safety portfolio in Pharmaceutical Systems. It has been designed to deliver up to a two ml dose volume, while enabling an ergonomic and safe injection experience for both patients and healthcare providers. We have launched \u2013 we have secured a number of pharmaceutical partners that plan to commercially launch our new product towards the end of fiscal 2021. Also in BD Medical, during fiscal 2021, we will launch the BD Pyxis ES 1.7, which adds new capabilities and deeper integration of pharmacy and nursing by enhancing automation in the operating room with the Pyxis Anesthesia Station. In BD Interventional, we had a robust year of product launches across its three businesses. Of particular note, the Peripheral Intervention team launched the 0.18 and 300 millimeter LUTONIX DCBs in the U.S. and launched LUTONIX in Japan. PI also launched the elevation Single Insertion Multiple Sample Breast Biopsy device in addition to the Caterpillar Embolization device, which represents our first foray into the world of interventional oncology. Our Surgery business launched a completely robotic compatible version of our market-leading anatomically configured 3DMax Inguinal Hernia Mesh as well as the Pureprep Infection Prevention product. Finally, our UCC business capitalized on our developing position in female incontinence by launching drydock 2.0, which is designed to help women who suffer from incontinence to use PureWick at home. Fiscal 2021 promises to be another year of innovative product launches across the Interventional segment. The team worked hard to minimize the impact of COVID on our product launch schedule, leading to further commercialization of products across all businesses. For competitive reasons, we won't share any specifics with you, but suffice to say you should expect further commercialization activity of new products in our oncology, infection prevention and acute urology platforms in particular. Finally, I want to provide an update on our FDA PMA submission for the LUTONIX Drug Coated Balloon and its use in below the knee. The FDA has recently notified us that our PMA supplement remains non-approvable. We are working collaboratively with the FDA to determine what our next steps maybe, if any. As a reminder, our entire LUTONIX business today represents less than 1% of our overall sales, and we do not include any revenues in our forecast related to this submission. Before we move on, I want to take a moment and acknowledge John DeFord, who will retire from BD at the end of the calendar year. As you all know, John has had a remarkable career and has made a tremendous and lasting impact since joining BD three years ago. While he will continue to serve as an advisor and a consultant for us. Of course, we are going to miss John's leadership and we are going to miss his humor, but we are very excited for Patrick's appointment to the Chief Technology Officer. And we are confident that he is the right leader to deliver on our innovation strategy and product pipeline in our next phase of value creation. And as Patrick takes on this important new responsibility, we could not have asked for a better successor than Dave Hickey to lead BD Life Sciences and build on Patrick's track record of success. Dave has been leading the IDS team and the BD Veritor COVID-19 launch. Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our strategy. When I became CEO earlier this year, I outlined my vision for BD's next phase of value creation. It's what we call BD 2025, which included three drivers grow, simplify, and empower. And the drivers build upon BD strengths, our world-class manufacturing, global scale, our strong category leadership and deep capabilities in software and informatics. And we've made great progress in fiscal 2020 in building the foundation and beginning to execute against our new playbook. As I mentioned, we've been steadfast in strengthening our R&D capabilities and continuously improving our R&D effectiveness. And I'm excited about what is to come from the BD growth and innovation fund. We also look to augment our internal innovation strategy through tuck-in acquisitions. In fiscal 2020, we executed on six tuck-in transactions in higher growth markets, and I'll highlight just three. First is NAT Diagnostics, which is an early stage, privately held company, developing a molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care testing. This acquisition broadens our point-of-care testing capabilities in infectious disease. And while this product is still under development and a few years from launch, we are very excited about the technology and our point-of-care diagnostics business more broadly, and how this adds in a molecular capability to that. Another acquisition we closed on this year was Straub Medical, a privately held medical device company, that markets mechanical atherectomy and thrombectomy devices that treat peripheral arterial diseases. This acquisition expands our robust portfolio of PAD and Venous Solutions within our BD Interventional segment. And the third acquisition I'd like to highlight is Adaptec, an innovative startup company that developed Sensica UO, which is an automated urine output measurement solution. It captures hourly urine output measurements and integrate this into the electronic medical record through the BD HealthSight platform. This is actually going to be BD Interventional's first connected smart device, which leverages BD's interoperability position that we have today and about 70% of all U.S. hospitals. We have a robust funnel of deals and we continue to increase our focus here as we move into fiscal 2021. Our efforts around simplification and Project Recode and Inspire Quality, all remain on track. If anything, we have the opportunity to accelerate some projects with some of the COVID-19 test reinvestment proceeds. As I reflect on FY2020, I am proud of how the company worked to navigate through the headwinds of COVID and the Alaris ship hold. Our response to these challenges along with a successful launch of COVID-19 testing enabled BD to deliver flat revenue performance on an FX-neutral basis for the year. As I look ahead, there are some challenges that we face as a company, namely COVID and the Alaris remediation, the latter of which I am confident we will resolve. But there are many more opportunities ahead to drive growth and accelerate our impact on healthcare around the world. We have the right strategy. We're making the right investments. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Chris Reidy, and then I'll make a few concluding remarks. Good morning, Bob. Yes. So on the issue of the guide related to \u2013 you know that we guided Veritor at $1 billion to $1.5 billion. When you add BD MAX, that's running at around 400 in that area, so you can add that on top of that. So the way to think about how much is within the $1 billion to $1.5 billion of revenue that we're forecasting. Our guidance assumes a certain amount of reinvestment of that. So not letting it all flow through. As you think about \u2013 if Veritors looking like it'll be above $1.5 billion, we would look to invest more than that going forward. And we would likely have some investment depending on the investments in the pipeline and we'll talk to that in a moment. And let some of it flow through to the bottom line as well. So we'll assess that as we're going through the year. But if it's over the $1.5 billion, we would look to invest more, but still allow a portion of that flow to the bottom line as well. Good morning, David. Yes. David, good question. So I think if you look at it on an underlying basis, we are in that range that we're talking about that we've talked about around that 5% plus. We're in that. So if you look at we're in the low to mid-single digits in the core, of course, that has, and it maybe on that lower side of that. You've got the Alaris headwind, of course, which is still annualizing in the year as well. So that is a headwind that is built in to the core. If you take that out, you're back in right in that range that you mentioned before. So I'll let Chris add some more commentary on that. But just a reminder on that, we still do have annualization of the Alaris impact built into that. Sure. Good questions, David. So as you think about what we've shared before, we shared 8 million tests per month by October, which we're in. 12 million tests per month starting in March of 2021, that's our capacity ramp on Veritor. And so those capacity plans remain firmly intact and so that's the basis of our outlook that we've shared. I made the comment, of course, we do continue to monitor the supply demand dynamics of the market, and we'll provide you with any updates on additional capacity expansions beyond that if we were to make those, but we won't provide those until that capacity were to come online. So that's just a little bit of background there. As we come to ASPs, we had said $20 ASP, we did a little bit better than that in Q4, as I mentioned. But we do expect to see pricing headwinds, ASP erosion, as there are more competitors in the market now than there were at the start of Q4. And we expect that there will be other entrance. And so we would expect that $20 ASP could come down as we move through the year. Okay. Thanks, David. Good morning, Amit. Yes. Great question, Amit and good morning. So during the quarter, as I mentioned, we did observe sequential improvements across our businesses that are more elective procedure oriented, as well as in lab testing volumes. We saw them through the quarter evolve to around 90%. We've got \u2013 obviously we have access to some pretty unique information through our BD MedMined platform, which is in about 338 hospitals that gives us literally real time insights into hospital trends on inpatient admissions, ICU admissions, ER trends, ER outpatient versus inpatient, we can see that literally on a daily basis, what happened yesterday in these institutions, which are broadly distributed across the U.S. And so, as we look at that, we see hospital inpatient admissions trending around 85% to 90%, and we've posted some of this data in our deck so that we can share that more broadly. We thought there would be some information that you'd be interested in. So our projections and outlook do not assume any significant change to that on the positive nor on the downside as we think about the potential of a COVID resurgence. We do see, and as we talk to healthcare providers around the world, there's been a lot of preparation and learnings from the initial COVID surge, how to better keep facilities open, how to make patients more comfortable. We're still coming in for elective procedures. So I think we certainly don't expect that it would retrench back if there is a significant resurgence, retrench back to the lower utilization levels that we saw last year. But of course, that's difficult to predict, and it could be somewhere between where it is today and there could be, could it stay where it is, could be, could it get better if there's not a large resurgence could be. But we've taken a more moderate kind of middle of the road assumption that it will be relatively stable as it is today as we think about our forward-looking guidance. Good morning, Vijay. I think that's just an important point to reiterate Vijay as Chris mentioned, right. Because of the timing of our fiscal year, we don't anniversary the lower utilization rates from a COVID impact until Q3, right. The first and second quarter, our compares are still at a pre-COVID basis of utilization. And so that obviously has an impact on that. And so it still be \u2013 even despite that in those mid-single digits, low-single digits, and the base business is actually quite strong. Nothing looking forward, but obviously a lot of impacts throughout the year, lumpiness from the COVID drop through and what have you. We did a lot to offset that. We reduced the inventory levels as we talked about. So it did feel like a lot of lumpiness, but we were able to offset a good portion of the drag to be in a solid position as we exited the year. But going forward, I don't see anything that would be lumpy in nature. Hey. Good morning, Robbie. Yes. Good questions, Brian. So the double install base of over 50,000 does include those that have been put in the nursing home. As I mentioned, we are looking at what additional menu we can put on that platform. We have a number of opportunities that we think are pretty exciting. Of course, we've never had an install base in the nursing home segment itself. And so part of that work that we've done is actually identifying what specific assays are relevant to the nursing home segment. There's other segments that we now have Veritor placements, and we wouldn't have looked at before in terms of \u2013 is there some unique menu that is more relevant to these segments that haven't been traditional call points for us. And so we're actually just wrapping up. We've just wrapped up that work. And again, we'll be using. That'll be an area of investment is in additional menu expansion on Veritor, where you reinvest some of those profits to add additional menu that we think are relevant to some of the new call points that we have Veritor placed in. So we see longevity there beyond the COVID-19 testing itself. Of course, as you know, we are expanding the menu there, very actively working on our COVID-19 flu assay. As we've always said, we'll provide timing on that when we're ready to \u2013 when we get EUA, and we launched that same thing on BD MAX beyond the assay that we've already launched in Europe with our partner CerTest. So we feel really good about the momentum on Veritor. We hear great feedback from our customers on that. And again, we do see longevity on the install base, not only for COVID-19, which as I mentioned before. We think we'll have more longevity. If you ask me this time last quarter, said how much testing is going to happen in FY2022? I would just say that I feel more confident today that there will be longer testing runway beyond 2021 of COVID testing into 2022 and potentially beyond. Obviously then our work on adding menu to that will prolong the growth opportunities for Veritor beyond the COVID window. Thanks Brian for the call. Go ahead. Yes. We're looking at that Brian. And again, if we decide to do that, we'll share that when we're ready to launch it. But I would just say at this point, particularly in developed markets, we are very confident in the value that the instrumented platform brings. Again, just as a reminder, our instrumented platform is at a very different cost base than most any other instrumented platform right in that $250, $300 range. So it's not a significant capital, it's not a challenge for any customer when it comes to that. It wouldn't even be a challenge significantly to bring it into the home necessarily, and we get the benefits, right. Remember, we're one of the original inventors of lateral flow testing. Our first technologies were manual as we're all, and all of those technologies move to instrumented platforms because they got higher performance on flu and RSV and COVID is of course even a more critical assay to get right. And we see the benefits of an instrumented platform when it comes to sensitivity specificity. We still believe strongly in that. We continue \u2013 you've seen us put out a number of \u2013 support a number of publications, whether or not it's comparisons of technologies or recent publication, you probably saw around the role of antigen testing versus molecular testing when it comes to projecting infectivity, and that was relative to cell culture methods, which are the reference for, I believe that for patient to be infective. So we're going to continue to invest very heavily behind scientific evidence, and you can expect more of that from us. Again, it would support the value of Veritor and the technology that we're deploying. Hey, Larry. Good morning. Good questions, Larry. So when it comes to \u2013 let me take the first two and then I'll turn it over to Chris for the third. So in terms of what gives us more confidence, I think you nailed it. It's the fact that we are systematically working our way through the various testing stages. And so we've completed that much more testing since the last update. And that gives us confidence. We also continue to have very active and ongoing dialogue with the FDA around our progress. And that's why as I made earlier, we do have greater confidence in the timelines that we've shared last, which is late Q2, early Q3 of this fiscal year. When it comes to the hardware recalls, that's really part of our remediation of the Alaris franchise. It's us looking at all the different complaint history and are there any further improvements we can be making to the platform. That's also part of our 43 response and activities. And so there's no other filings or anything, those are all built into the current 510(k) submission work. They do not have any impact on the timing of the 510(k) submissions. Good morning, Larry. Yes. So we're seeing still strong performance in Asia in terms of utilization. We're seeing very strong control of COVID across pretty much all Asian nations at this point. But as you mentioned Europe, we are seeing quarantine measures tighten. I would say that \u2013 again, European countries are much better prepared this time to continue to deliver care through that period of time. Can there be an impact on procedure volumes as we look forward? Yes. Out of Europe, it may be slightly less prepared, obviously there's different factors in public versus private healthcare systems as well that influenced that. But I think from what we're seeing now, we're definitely seeing better management and continued use of procedures early in this resurgence. But again, that's one of the caveats that we had to make. We can't predict the extent of everything on a forward-looking basis. And so our assumptions, we do recognize that particularly in Europe, there can be some increase, but if it's a significant increase, that would be something that's not in our current assumptions. And then maybe Larry, this is Tom. Let me just maybe add on a little bit to Chris's good comments there. I'd say what you're seeing us do is from in the face of a pandemic and the utilization impact, you're seeing us work our way back to that driving durable, sustainable growth, right. We all recognize the markets are anything but predictable. And we worked hard \u2013 your earlier question was, spend a lot of time thinking about that range, you can debate and should you have a wide range or a narrower range that at least keeps people from getting on either end of it, which is where we ended up at. But we believe we've executed well against challenges in remarkable times. So you can see us doing that as we offset the COVID headwinds this quarter. And I think if you take, for example, this year, in our worst months, we saw significant headwinds across our business. We develop COVID testing. We saw the return of procedures, and we turn a negative headwind into a tailwind, and we showed mid-single digits growth. If you think about prior to COVID, we thought about our end markets growing about 4% and our investments in R&D being in higher growth markets and select investments in tuck-in M&A further supplementing that growth. We feel still strong about that path forward to 5% plus growth that you've heard me talk about. And of course, what we're doing now is, this year, in fact with Veritor of course, we're going to be nearly double that level. But what we're doing is we're taking a portion of those profits and we're further investing in our growth and innovation fund. We're investing behind further growth opportunities and right, we're continuing that work on accelerating inorganic innovation or our tuck-in M&A. Again, all in the spirit of driving that durability and consistency of our growth profile. So just to summarize that, we feel good about our capabilities, our innovation, and the factors that are in our control as we think about the business going forward. Good morning, Rick. Let me comment on just at a high level perspective and then turn it to Chris to talk about kind of how we think about it within the P&L. So obviously you're going to see R&D at, what we'll call higher than a normalized level in 2021 because of the reinvestment of the Veritor proceeds. I would expect it to see that. Of course, as I mentioned, that 8% growth that you saw in Q4 were coming off of relatively flat R&D growth over the last five, six years during the synergy window. And so it is \u2013 as you mentioned, it's a notable step up and we will be continuing to increase R&D because of not just our base strategy has that in it, but we're using this opportunity to reinvest those Veritor proceeds and leveraging that growth and innovation fund and the way that we're selecting incremental projects through that process, which was a process that was very successful, obviously at BARDA and the John has helped implement here at BD. So as we think about going forward on the P&L beyond what we're going to see in 2021, I'll turn that over to Chris. But you would expect to see R&D growing in line with revenue on a forward basis beyond 2021, at least in that level. Yes. Great question. And let me take the first one on flu and then Chris on leverage. So flu is certainly light in the Southern hemisphere, so it's unclear what the impact will be this season. I think for us, COVID obviously overwhelms the whole thing. I mean, we're selling every Veritor test we can make. So the whole balance between are we making Veritor tests or COVID tests. We're selling at this point obviously a lot of COVID tests. We are making flu tests and we are shipping flu tests. But if flu tests aren't being utilized that level, we'll make more COVID tests at least for the first couple of quarters. And then obviously we do have a combination assay in development that we look forward to launching later this year. And again, we'll give more color on that. So I think it is fair to say that, I mean, the reality is, is if people are isolated more and are wearing masks and are doing things, will there be a lighter flu season in the Northern hemisphere as well, logic would say so, but the impacts on our business, I think will be different this year because of the role of COVID and the presence of COVID. Thanks for the question. Good morning, Jason. Maybe Simon as well. Thanks for the questions, Jerome. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question, Matt. Good morning. Josh. I would say that \u2013 as we \u2013 we did see some improvements on the capital in the research area, BDB, we saw it across the Board. I'd say dispensing is another area, obviously capital part of that's operating leases. We still do sell some in capital. But I'd comment, we did see the U.S. dispensing business returned to the modest growth in Q4. And we ended the year with strong net gains and committed contracts with a very strong Q4 in committed contracts and we ended the year net positive there from a competitive perspective as well. So we're seeing good signs there. As you mentioned, it's a little bit difficult with Alaris to fully compare that, but we were seeing the restarting of it, and we're able to get back into labs now to do those installations, the Kiestra installation. There is a big complex, those are big complex walls, change electricity sockets, but they weren't happening throughout the pandemic that are restarting now. Thank you for the question. So thanks everyone for the good dialogue this morning. We've shared with you the challenges, opportunities, and successes that shaped Q4 and fiscal 2020, and that are influencing our expectations for the year ahead. One thing we didn't talk about though, were the people of BD, the 70,000 associates around the globe, who rallied around our purpose of advancing the world of health at a time when the need was most urgent. So I want to close with a message to the BD team. Thank you for your focus on our purpose, for your resilience when it came to executing our most critical priorities and your willingness to embrace bold new ideas, you delivered a strong Q4 that exceeded our expectations to finish a trying year on a high note. By building on the bold actions we took in FY2020, and by continuing to execute our long-term strategy to grow, simplifying and empower, we will address healthcare's immediate needs while bringing more innovative new solutions that will support our growth across all three of our segments. In FY2021, there will be no shortage of opportunities for you to think boldly make a meaningful impact and change more lives for the better. On behalf of the entire executive team, I want to say thank you to BD associates around the world for your efforts, sacrifices, and achievements over the past year. You showed the world and each other just how vital BD is to the delivery of healthcare. Thanks again, and let's keep going forward."

            "name": "Simon Campion",
            "content": "Yes. Just to back that, I think we shared some survey work on the August call, and we've repeated that survey work with about 600 physicians in our Surgery and PI business. And they are seeing volumes rebound I would say significantly, their capacity is at I think quite significant level compared to pre-COVID, their office-based volumes are increasing for the most part, so the funnel of patients is pretty robust. And there's still some \u2013 what we turn rollover patients as well that are in the mix of patients that were scheduled earlier this year, but have the procedure postponed. And so they're still in the mix as well. So it's pretty robust on the elective side right now. Yes. Thanks, Tom. And again, referring to that survey that we've just completed. Certainly, the majority of physicians we spoke to reflected on patient sentiment being one of the driving factors moving here. And some significant data came out about the oncology patient set, breast cancer and colon patients in particular. The decline in screening that's happened in the early phase of COVID is going to contribute to an extra 36,000 deaths \u2013 33,000 deaths in the U.S. from cancer because of a lack of screening in the early phases of COVID. And so as you walk around different cities in the U.S. and certainly where I live in Rhode Island, you see billboards now with hospitals and practices encouraging patients to go attend. And I think the protocols that they've implemented are certainly establishing great framework for patients to feel comfortable about it. But still, I think hospitals want to do procedures, physicians want to do them, and the big variable here is getting the patients back in for screening and subsequent procedures after that. Yes. Hi, it's Simon. As I think over the past pre-COVID, certainly we had seen a, I think a significant rebound in our LUTONIX business in or around the 70% to 80% of Q1 2019 numbers, so before Katsanos, and so on. Over the past several months or Q3 was our Q3, that obviously deteriorated quite a lot. But I'd say coming out of September, we were pretty much at the pre-COVID levels, which were in that 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels. That's all making sense. And again, some recent work that we've done a year ago and I just repeated, a year ago about 80% of physicians that we surveyed were less than comfortable with Paclitaxel safety based on Katsanos and based on the FDA panel and so on and so forth. And now that has flipped. The recent data that we got that has flipped that 80% are now comfortable with Paclitaxel safety and the VOYAGER data, and the data that was provided at panel and so on and so forth. I think that reiterate the safety of Paclitaxel in general and LUTONIX specifically. So it was a significant driver for us in Q4. In the peripheral business, both domestically and in Japan where we've had a really successful launch since we commercialized fully in December. And we continue to get FDA approvals on the 018 platform, and the 300 millimeter balloon platform and the low profile AV platform. So we're pretty pleased with where we are right now on LUTONIX."

            "name": "Christopher Reidy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are pleased with our fiscal fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance. Overall revenues were $4.8 billion up 4.4% on both a reported and an FX-neutral basis. We estimate the net impact of COVID was a positive 210 basis points as COVID-19 testing revenue more than offset the ongoing negative impact from lower utilization across our businesses. Even after adjusting for the net COVID-19 effect, we are pleased that we're still able to grow our revenues despite the Alaris Pump ship hold. We estimate the negative impact of the Alaris ship hold was 240 basis points. BD Medical revenues totaled $2.3 billion and were down 4.9% year-over-year. We estimate COVID negatively impacted the business by about 370 basis points. We estimate the Alaris ship hold negative impact was 450 basis points. Medication Delivery Solutions saw sequential improvement consistent with healthcare utilization trends, but still continue to be impacted negatively by COVID-19 on a year-over-year basis. Internationally, MDS is declined, largely reflected the impact of China's volume-based procurement, as well as inventory reductions we took in the quarter. Medication Management Solutions, the Alaris ship hold continues to have a negative impact on the business units overall results and there was a difficult comparison with the prior year. International MMS sales were very strong driven by infusion pumps sales in Europe. In U.S. dispensing, we saw a solid growth and close the year with strong new committed contracts. In Diabetes Care, sales declines reflected ongoing market price pressures. Pharm System sales were up double-digits this quarter and ended the fiscal year with a strong 9.4% growth driven by our pre-filled and safety syringe portfolios. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion and were up 31.4%. We estimate the net positive impact of COVID was 26.2 percentage points in the quarter. Our Preanalytical Systems business was down 3% year-over-year. We have seen sequential improvement as routine lab testing volumes improved. Our Diagnostic Systems business was up 97.3% driven by just over 440 million in COVID-19 testing. Biosciences sales were down 9% globally. However, we saw a sequential improvement in reagent sales as research and testing continues to resume. BD Interventional revenues totaled just under $1 billion and were down 3.5% for the quarter. We estimate the net negative impact from COVID was 11.2 percentage points. Our Surgery and our Peripheral Intervention businesses, both saw a solid sequential improvements as elective procedures continue to return closer to pre-COVID levels in several geographies, most notably in the United States. The Peripheral Intervention business was particularly strong in Japan on the heels of a successful LUTONIX launch. The Urology and Critical Care business performed well with the U.S. returning to growth though offset by an international decline. Now turning to the P&L. Gross margins were 54.8% or 55.1% on an FXN basis, the latter down 200 basis points year-over-year. While we benefited from higher margin COVID-19 testing revenues, it was more than offset by the continued drag from lower volumes, which drove unfavorable manufacturing variances. We are actively managing our cash and inventory balances globally, and we expect to see more COVID-related manufacturing variances in fiscal 2021, negatively impacting our gross margin line. SSG&A expense of $1.2 billion was 25.1% of revenues up a 110 basis points year-over-year. SSG&A includes a $25 million investment to the BD Foundation this quarter in support of our longstanding commitment to advancing the world of health and supporting the communities where we live and work. We continue to see higher shipping costs related to the pandemic and we also had elevated levels of spend related to Veritor in the quarter. R&D expense of $279 million, representing 5.8% of revenues was up 20 basis points year-over-year. In dollar terms, spending was up 8% on a year-over-year basis as we invested in COVID diagnostics and other growth initiatives. We expect fiscal 2021 spending on R&D to continue to be higher as we continue to focus on innovation and implement some of the reinvestment plans, Tom mentioned earlier. Operating income was $1.1 billion resulting in an operating margin of 23.9%. On an FX-neutral basis, margins decreased 320 basis points, mainly reflecting the contractions in gross margin as well as higher SSG&A and R&D. Interest/other expense net was $110 million, resulting in a decline of $4 million on a year-over-year basis. We had favorability in interest expense this quarter as we repaid debt. The adjusted tax rate came in as expected in the high teens at 18.7%. Preferred dividends in the quarter were $22.8 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.79 as previously discussed and this includes a $0.02 headwind from FX. For the year, we generated $3.5 billion in cash flows from operations and our free cash flows were $2.7 billion net of $810 million in capital expenditures. In line with our goal of continuing to increase the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, we paid down $950 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our total debt repayment to $1.7 billion for the year. This resulted in a net leverage ratio of 3x \u2013 3.0x as of September 30, 2020. Now we wanted to share some broad thoughts on fiscal 2021. As we look ahead, the greatest uncertainty we see is the recent COVID-19 resurgences around the world and the potential impact this may have on general healthcare utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. Our guidance assumes no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Assuming no significant changes in utilization and procedure volumes associated with COVID-19 resurgences, we are comfortable forecasting low to mid single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth excluding the COVID testing revenues. Our COVID testing revenues in fiscal 2020 were approximately $580 million. On a total company level, inclusive of COVID testing, we expect FX-neutral revenues to grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 100 basis points to revenue growth on a reported basis. We expect our adjusted non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.40 to $12.60. Again, our guidance assumes no significant changes in utilization and procedure volumes associated with COVID-19 resurgences. This also does not assume any potential upside to our 1 billion to 1.5 billion in Veritor testing revenues. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, I want to point out some quarterly phasing, as you think about the upcoming year. Given that we are at September year end, we will not anniversary the initial COVID-19 impact into our fiscal Q3. In addition, U.S. biosciences also has difficult comparisons in fiscal Q1 due to licensing revenue in the prior year. And in Medication Management Solutions, our infusion business has tougher comparisons throughout the year, given the timing of the ship hold and shipments under medical necessity, as well as European sales related to COVID. As Tom mentioned earlier, we do not assume any revenues associated with the Alaris 510(k). However, offsetting these headwinds I just discussed, we would expect our COVID-19 testing revenues to be more heavily weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. In addition, we will anniversary the launch of our COVID testing in the fourth quarter. And taking all of the above into consideration and looking at the Street consensus, we would suggest a phasing that shifts earnings from Q4 into the first half of the year. I also want to take a moment to address FY2022 by making a few observations. Regarding our COVID-19 testing revenues, we see this as perhaps the biggest variable to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Depending on the level of success of Veritor in fiscal 2021, it could make for a difficult comparison to our revenues and earnings in fiscal 2022. And regarding Alaris, as Tom mentioned, we have a higher level of confidence today in our ability to submit the 510(k) at the end of fiscal Q2 2021 or early Q3. We would assume a contribution beginning sometime in fiscal 2022. Keep in mind, we ship pumps under medical necessity in fiscal 2020, thus, we would not necessarily assume there's a one-for-one pent-up demand when we obtain 510(k) clearance. Regarding the remainder of our business and assuming a more normal healthcare utilization environment, we would assume the business will return to an underlying mid single-digit growth rate in fiscal 2022. And with that, let's move on to Q&A. Good morning, Bob. I think it's fair to say, we plan to reinvest among the initial $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. We're investing roughly 20% of the profits back into the business bump. Yes. I would say David, the core is strong. You saw that in the fourth quarter as well. It's doing well. The margins are improving. To your point around the 2019 to 2021, there are a number of things. We are seeing synergies from the BARDA transaction over that period of time kicking in. Then obviously it's impacted. You have to take out the COVID impact, the drag, and then the add back for Veritor. But keep in mind, if we had a bit of a drag during that period in the China VBP and the Alaris, and when you adjust for that, we are seeing growth in the margins and feel very comfortable with the long-term view of the underlying 5% and 10% on the bottom, and that's very consistent with what we've seen. I think to your point, we are looking \u2013 you're seeing some depression of the margins from the investments that we're making as well. So we're not letting it all flow through. We're making the investments that we outlined. Good morning. That's right. No it doesn't imply that, we'd have to look at how you're doing the math, but it would imply more in that mid-single digits on the underlying ex-COVID testing. So thinking that 4% to 5% range, which is very healthy. We do still see the drag. As I pointed out in some of the prepared remarks, we see that tough compare in Alaris against the first quarter. We do still have the tough compare against the first half of the year in the base business until we overlap the COVID period, but then rebounding in the second half of the period. So when you cut through all of that you think in the mid-single digits for the underlying business. Yes. So we have to work with you on the math there too. But I think, what we're saying is if you use Q4 as a jumping off point of the year. We're likely to have some headwinds as we talked about. And we are making adjustments for the investments that we were talking about, what have you, Veritor does lift that. But taking all that into consideration, we would expect to see some good margin growth compared to the baseline of where we were in 2020. But it doesn't quite get to the 26 number that you're talking to. I'm not sure what your question is there. We did give the free cash flow \u2013 what was your question on that Vijay? Good question, Robbie. So, no, I think some of the cash impacts that we consider kind of below the line or having the past been integration spending in EUMDR. Those were the biggest ones. And the integration spending has been \u2013 will be lower going into 2021. EUMDR is still with us. We continue to invest to make sure we're in good shape with the regulations there. So there will be a portion of that, but the free cash flow conversion will increase in 2021. Sure. It's a great question. Obviously, we've been following things very, very closely. We do see, as we said sequential improvement in our businesses. And so we took that into account. Obviously we're watching the potential for a resurgence very closely. And I think we were very clear when we gave the guidance that we're not assuming a major resurgence that would have a big impact on utilization and in elective surgeries. So we are not assuming that. And that's something that we'll have to wait and see. But at the same time, as we look at the course of the business and the way hospital systems are able to handle the current level, that gives us a certain amount of comfort and visibility as we go forward. I think the other thing that we have in here is the fact that Veritor gives us some natural offset if there is some level of utilization impact, it would probably go hand in hand over the course of the year with a bit more incremental Veritor testing. So there's some opportunity there. And obviously we have built in some piece of our investment of the Veritor revenues and we can gate that to some extent. And so with all of those things, we felt comfortable again, assuming that there's no major change in the resurgence that we could achieve the guidance that we gave. Good morning, Larry. Yes. And then in terms of your question regarding the phasing, I'd say we commented in our prepared remarks that as we looked at the consensus, we did feel that consensus was a bit high in Q4. We wanted to correct that and that we think that some of that should be moved to the first half. I would say move a little bit more of that to the Q2 then to Q1, but Q1 is a bit light given what we're looking at. And so we just wanted to kind of get the quarterly phasing right up front out of the box as we enter the year. And so that's why we were very specific around, take it out of the fourth quarter, put it in the first half. And I would add a little bit more in Q2 than Q1. Yes. I think you got \u2013 for the most part, I think you are talking about it, right. Obviously, we feel good about \u2013 there's going to be a lot of movement in 2022 from a number of things on the topline. And the biggest variable obviously is what happens to Veritor and you heard Tom say, that we feel better about the testing going into 2022, but we've also said it wouldn't be prudent to assume the same level of testing in 2022 from 2021. And we'll obviously update you as we go from quarter-to-quarter. But you would expect to see some drop off in that piece. And obviously that slope, whether it's a cliff, it doesn't look like it's a cliff in 2022 right now. But it's certainly a downward slope as we think about it. And some of what we're doing in terms of the investing of Veritor spending will help mitigate some of that slope to a certain extent. So we're watching that very closely. But as we look at it, the other variable is when does Alaris revenues start coming back to pre-ship hold kind of levels. And we were very clear. We did not include anything in our 2021 guidance for that. And we're not predicting where that's going to be in 2022, but at some point 2022, we would expect that to start kicking back in. It's probably not as big a pent-up demand because of the medical necessity amounts that we've had in 2020 and potentially into 2021. But those are the things to keep in mind. But we do feel that the base business in 2022 on an underlying basis will be very solid and continue to be solid. So that's just some ways to think about it. Sure. So what I would say and reemphasize, we clearly are, as you said, focus on innovation, and you would expect R&D to increase. You're absolutely right that we did emphasize that 8% growth year-over-year because we need to get back to that 6% mark. We had fallen below that over the last few years, and it's important that we get back there. I think that is probably a good proxy for 2021 to use because that 6% is off of a much higher revenue base as well. So from a dollar standpoint, that's a pretty big step up. So that's a good proxy to think about is that 6% of revenue going forward. And I would say in terms of the 3x leverages, we're proud that we got down to 3.0x this past quarter on a net basis. And as we've always said, that was the initial commitment, but then we would expect that to continue to float down with increasing EBITDA as we go forward. And so that is still the commitment. We wouldn't want to operate just at the 3x level. We think a company like ours should be in that 2.5-ish kind of range at least. And so we would expect that to float down that way over time. Sure. Great question. And thanks to allow us to add some clarity there. That's exactly the thought process. As we initially looked at this, we thought that it could be very much a cliff from 2021 to 2022, and that one way to mitigate that, that cliff would be to make investments in 2021 that help us drive long-term growth, but also are kind of one-year investment boluses that will kind of mitigate that cliff to a certain extent. That logic still continues as we think about testing extending into 2022 because it wouldn't be characterized, as I said by a cliff, but it certainly the potential for a downward slope. And by making some of these investments in 2021, it would help mitigate that slope to a certain extent. The biggest variable is what that slope looks like. But I think we're very comfortable that we can do that in 2021, and then see where that testing in 2022 is going. So it's looking less like a cliff. Those investments certainly are the kinds of investments that we could make. That would be an expense in 2021, but not only would go away in 2022, but would potentially drive increases in 2022 in earnings by investing in a variety of things, R&D, M&A kind of deals that become more accretive in year two, that kind of thing. So it's exactly what your question implies what we're doing. Yes. It's still latter. We haven't seen the pressure yet. But as Tom mentioned, I think earlier in Q4 the ASP was a bit higher than we had signaled. But we don't think it's prudent to continue to think that that would hold up as other competitors move into the market and the different dynamics that we'll be facing as we go throughout the year. So we had originally signaled the $20 ASP and we think it was \u2013 it certainly was higher than that in our Q4. But we think that will be under pressure as we go through, and that is what we have in our guidance assumptions. Yes. And this is consistent with what we've said in the past. The percentage of revenue that are focused on capital is in that kind of 15%-ish range. We've said that in the past. And you might imagine where that is. It's in, in areas like KIESTRA and in the M&A side for the most part, a little bit in Biosciences. We have seen pressure on capital during the third quarter, particularly and we have seen that improve. A lot of it has to do with the inability to install during the third quarter because hospitals weren't allowing people to come in that were not patients appropriately. So we did see that pressure, we saw that sequentially improve into Q4. And so we would expect that to continue to improve through 2021 as well, and we don't \u2013 assuming that there's no major resurgence. As we said, our guidance contemplates that assuming and being at normal levels in 2021."

It will be available for replay through August 13th, 2020 on the Investors at bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 3197917. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki Senior, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki you may begin. \nMonique Dolecki: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. We hope that everyone continues to be healthy and safe. With safety in mind, we are again taking a more virtual approach to our call today while also to exercising social distancing. Joining me in person we have Tom Polen, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Joining by phone we have Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. In particular there continues to be significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commentary that we are providing today includes information regarding the July trends we are seeing in our businesses. We have made certain assumptions in how we are managing our business but that could change as we move forward. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of the purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Okay. Thank you, Monique and good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. If I had to summarize Q3 in two words, it would be execution and impact. I'm very proud of our team for the performance they delivered in the third quarter given the challenging environment. What stands out to me the most is the progress the BD team made executing and delivering on both our short and long-term agenda creating value for patients, customers, and shareholders. We launched the COVID-19 assay on Veritor, secured injection device orders for future vaccination campaigns, and scaled manufacturing to ensure continued supply of critical medical technologies across the continuum of care. We announced several U.S. government collaborations to expand U.S. capacity in critical to COVID product areas. We worked closely with our customers as they resumed medical procedures throughout the quarter. And we saw those procedures continue to increase as we exited the quarter. At the same time, the team never lost sight of the long-term advancing our growth strategy, driving our innovation pipeline, and executing on our cost savings and simplification initiatives. I'm confident the steps we're taking now will help BD emerge from the pandemic strong and put us in the best position for the long-term. Let's jump into the quarter on slide four. Our third quarter results reflect the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare around the world as we saw strong demand for COVID-19 related diagnostics and significant pressure on the parts of our portfolio that support elective procedures research routine care and lab testing. We anticipated we'd see the biggest negative impact from COVID-19 in Q3 and it's largely played out that way. All-in COVID-19 had a net negative topline impact of $600 million in Q3. Chris is going to provide more detail on performance during the quarter and our perspectives on recovery. But let me share a high level summary of what we're seeing starting with Interventional. Across the Interventional segment, we saw sequential improvement each month during the quarter as hospitals and patients started to resume elective and non-urgent procedures. In June, China delivered positive year-on-year growth in all three BDI businesses. We continue to watch China closely since they're further along in their post-COVID restart. We exited Q3 seeing BDI procedure volumes at approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels. Moving on to the Medical segment, we're really pleased with the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical Systems business which is growing high single digits on a year-to-date basis. We view both the pharma systems business and Diabetes Care businesses as more insulated and less impacted by COVID-19. As you know the rest of the segment's portfolio is closely tied to overall healthcare consumption, so naturally the impact of lower hospital utilization was very pronounced across the medical device consumables portfolio even more so than we had initially anticipated. That said we're encouraged that we saw demand for medical device consumables improve in June. Lastly, early demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity did spike in April as expected and then tapered down throughout the quarter. Now, looking closer at Life Sciences, as expected, we saw very strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and supplies during the quarter which was offset by a deferral of routine lab work as well as delays in capital investments on both the research and the diagnostic side. In Q4, we expect continued strong demand for our COVID-19 diagnostics solutions with the addition of the Veritor assay to the portfolio. In addition we did see reagent orders begin to pick up in June for both research and clinical applications which demonstrates that researchers continue to get back into the labs. While this remains a dynamic situation we're providing revenue and EPS guidance for Q4 and the total year as we have improved near-term visibility. Based on what we know today we believe our guidance range reflects the trends we saw in June and July and accounts for our expectations as we close out the year and Chris will go into more detail later on the call. Despite the challenging environments it's clear that BD's durable capabilities and critical health care portfolio have been and will continue to be a vital part of the COVID-19 solution. And I'm confident that the actions we've been taking position BD increasingly well to support our customers through the pandemic and return to growth as the global economy and health care industry continue to stabilize and recover. Turning to slide five, on our last call, we discussed how the strength and diversity of BD's portfolio enables us to support the world's response to COVID-19 across the full continuum of care. The BD team made significant progress executing this agenda during the quarter positioning us well to finish the year with momentum. So, let me share a few highlights with you starting on slide six. First, today marks one month since we launched the SARS-COVID-2 antigen assay for the Veritor Plus system, which received FDA, EUA in early July. We believe this platform is a real game changer, dramatically expanding access to COVID-19 testing at the point of care and reliably diagnosing SARS-COVID-2 in 15 minutes. In the first month since launch we received very strong demand for both the Veritor Plus system and the SARS-COVID-2 assay including from our traditional customers as well as nontraditional accounts. In our first month of launch we've shipped more Veritor Readers than we normally do in an entire year. This is a strong indicator of the unprecedented interest and demand for near real-time point-of-care COVID testing. As one example we're proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on their efforts to expand access to rapid point-of-care testing in nursing homes through their initial order of 2,000 Veritor Plus systems and 750,000 SARS-COVID-2 antigen test kits. To support the very strong demand we're seeing we are leveraging our world-class manufacturing scale and expertise to significantly increase supply capacity. And we're feeling good about both our original goal of producing 10 million tests in Q4 and our scale-up to our initial eight million tests per month run rate by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, last week we announced a $24 million investment from the U.S. Department of Defense in collaboration with HHS to support the additional scale-up of U.S. manufacturing, which is expected to bring global production of the Veritor assay to 12 million tests per month at the end of February 2021. We're putting the full capabilities of BD behind this including not just those in our Life Sciences segment, but we're pulling in talent from both BD Medical and Interventional to support the scale-up. Detecting and containing coronavirus globally will take a collaborative industry-wide response. And we're proud to partner with AdvaMed on the national diagnostic supply registry to help ensure widespread availability of testing. The Veritor assay joins a portfolio of three molecular solutions for our COVID-19 testing that BD has already delivered for use with the BD MAX molecular system that includes two with EUAs and two with CE Mark. We're now producing one million COVID-19 rapid molecular diagnostic tests each month for use on BD MAX. And as I've shared we're investing in further expanding BD MAX capacity so we can produce an additional 900,000 tests per month. The installation of these additional production lines is well underway and remains on track to be at our new 1.9 million BD MAX tests per month run rate by the end of the calendar year. Cumulatively we've produced more than 3.5 million rapid molecular tests for BD MAX. In addition to investing to expand capacity, we're also investing to expand our portfolio. Our R&D teams are actively advancing our work to develop flu plus COVID assays for both our Veritor and MAX platforms, so we can better support health care providers and patients. I'm very proud of the entire BD team for driving scale and impact through our COVID-19 diagnostics solutions. If we move on to slide 7. To date, we've now received orders for 470 million needles and syringes from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and other entities in anticipation of vaccine programs we expect late this year or early 2021. These orders represent a mix of safety and conventional device types. While we anticipate initial shipments to the U.K. in fiscal year 2020, the majority of these orders will be delivered in fiscal year 2021. In addition, we formed a strategic public-private, partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority known as BARDA. BARDA will invest an estimated $42 million into a $70 million capital project to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for injection devices. The new capacity is expected to be online within 12 months. And once completed BARDA will have priority access to injection devices from these new manufacturing lines to support mass vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and future potential pandemics. As the world's largest manufacturer of syringes and needles, we are focused on fulfilling routine customer demand such as for annual flu vaccination, programs while also ensuring we can support surge demand for pandemic response. We are continuing active discussions with governments around the world about the need to place injection device orders quickly to ensure timely delivery for 2021. As expected I also want to provide an update on Alaris. We are working diligently and with urgency to prepare the 510(k) filing. Our focus is on ensuring a comprehensive submission that will ultimately help enable timely FDA review and clearance. We expect to submit the updated 510(k) in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021 based on ongoing dialogue with the FDA. We recognize there's a focus on the time line for the 510(k) submission and that's important. But taking a step back, we feel really good about the overall collaborative process we are engaging in with the FDA. In our pre-submission conversations, the focus has been on having a complete and robust submission and we have been spending additional time on aligning the testing protocols upfront, which is time and effort well spent. We believe the more work we do upfront to ensure the most robust submission, the better we are enabling a timely review and clearance process. As expected, our team has completed quite a bit of the testing and other work required for the submission. And we have a much better visibility to our submission timing now than we did when we last updated in May. When it comes to human factor testing, we've completed 100% of our formative testing which is a significant milestone involving 12 different human factor tests in the middle of the pandemic. We are pleased with the data and outcomes. We have also completed a substantial software system verification. Completion of formative human factor testing and software verification retires significant risk to the submission. We are taking a bit longer to ensure full alignment with the FDA on the final phase of human factor testing which is referred to as a summative testing. And again we feel this investment in time now best serves us in meeting our ultimate goal of a timely 510(k) clearance. We have submitted our summative testing protocols to the FDA and expect feedback shortly. Concurrently we are continuing to recruit clinicians for the next phase of human factor testing. And once we have that feedback from the FDA, we will be able to complete the summative testing. In addition, in our ongoing feedback discussions with the FDA, we made the decision to include an update to our specialty EtCO2 module which is important for clinical care and especially COVID response. The EtCO2 module is used to help monitor patients on ventilators, while medication is being administered. We believe this is the right decision for the Alaris system over the long term the patients we serve and far outweighs the additional time line of a few weeks it takes to include it again providing the most comprehensive submission to the FDA to help enable a timely review and clearance. I can't emphasize enough, how seriously we take this matter. As with any project of this magnitude and complexity, there are always obstacles along the way. But we're confident that we have the right resources, the right plan and the right team in place. We'll continue to address any issues that may arise in a way that ensures the most comprehensive submission to achieve our ultimate goal of a timely clearance. This dedicated team is executing well. And we will keep you updated as we make further progress on key milestones. Moving on to slide 8, and our innovation agenda. Each of our segments are focused on driving consistent durable growth for the long-term. They are doing this through innovation in areas where we are our strongest, where we see disproportionate new growth opportunities and that are aligned with emerging health care and technology trends. During the quarter we launched four new products and we remain on track to deliver our robust innovation pipeline for the year as shown on this slide. Taking a closer look in BD Life Sciences. Let me call out a few milestones in our Biosciences business. This quarter we launched an upgrade to the BD FACSMelody to expand from two-way sorting to four-way sorting, enabling customers to capture more cell types. This capability is available as an upgrade to our existing installed base and helps to further strengthen our position in the fast growing entry level sorter market. During the quarter we also launched software version 1.1 for FACSDuet. This software enables the automated preparation of antibody reagent cocktails, which is traditionally a manual time consuming and error prone step in clinical flow cytometry workflows. This release enables our team to continue driving the successful launch of the FACSDuet base model, as well as extend into the larger leukemia lymphoma and mixed lab markets. In BD Medical, we continue to see good traction with BD PhaSeal Optima, a next-gen closed system drug transfer device we launched late in FY 2019. Our customers are increasingly choosing Optima to protect health care workers handling hazardous drugs, because of the product's safety, ease of use and demonstrated performance as the device minimizes residual drug loss in vials compared to other similar systems. Sales of Optima have grown sequentially throughout FY 2020 despite the challenging pandemic period and the launches helped drive high single-digit growth across our CSTD platform. I also want to comment on our pharm systems business, which is a great example of the diversity of BD's portfolio and how it's a real strength and strategic advantage. Pharm systems continues to perform very well, growing high single digits on a year-to-date basis. We continue to be positive about the outlook for this business. In addition to favorable market trends enabling strong growth in the prefilled syringes platform, we've also been investing in advancing our self-injection systems to meet the needs of our pharmaceutical customers. And lastly in BD Interventional, we recently received FDA clearance for our next-generation targeted temperature management system. The AS Stat Temperature Management System offers a way to noninvasively control temperature within a narrow range for all appropriate patients. We have now leveraged and integrated BD's capabilities around EMR integration and data analytics into the AS Stat system, which also incorporates advanced algorithms and capabilities to enhance the patient and the physician experience. In our Peripheral Intervention business, which is a global market leader in biopsy and implantable ports, we recently launched our first interventional oncology product Caterpillar. This novel technology is used for embolization of the arteries serving tumors. While commercializing new products during the pandemic has been challenging, the device has been used in more than 50 interventions to date with excellent feedback on its deliverability, visibility, under angiography and ability to cause rapid and sustained embolization of the artery. While still early, we believe the positive response from customers is a good indicator of the growth opportunity ahead. Before I pass it over to Chris, I want to briefly comment on slide 9 and the other drivers of our long-term growth strategy simplify and empower. As we discussed last quarter, we've been extremely focused on cash and expense management throughout this pandemic period. And this discipline was reflected in our SSG&A this quarter. In addition to helping to strengthen our bottom line, these efforts ensured we flow investments to the most significant opportunities. In addition, Project Recode remains on track. As you'll recall Project Recode is our comprehensive internal simplification initiative that we expect to deliver approximately $300 million in savings over the next four years. We're focused on operating the business with discipline including how we can best deploy resources to maximize our impact. And lastly in empower, in July, we released our FY 2019 sustainability report, sharing our latest progress against our 2020 sustainability goals and reinforcing that ESG remains a fundamental element of our strategy. We look forward to announcing our 2030 impact goals later this year. And as always you can find our quarterly sustainability updates in the appendix of today's presentation. All-in, I'm proud of the progress that our team is making. With the successful launch of Veritor and significant injection device orders from multiple governments, we are clearly delivering on our short-term COVID-19 response plan. We're making the necessary investments and are working as quickly as possible to fully resolve the Alaris matters to ensure the completeness of this complex system to aid the FDA's review and clearance. At the same time, we continue to execute against our strategy for long-term value creation. While we continue to navigate a challenging environment, I'm confident the steps we're taking now will put BD in the best position for the long term. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Reidy: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with some comments regarding BD's ongoing response to the COVID pandemic. First, I'm very proud of our organization as we have continued to adapt to the rapidly changing environment and evolving needs of our customers and associates. We have responded with both strength and agility to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our BD associates and to also best serve our customers and their patients as they battle the pandemic. Second, we continue to see strong demand for our COVID related solutions. This includes diagnostic test on our BD MAX platform where we are continuing to increase capacity to meet demand. We are also actively ramping our efforts around the recently launched rapid antigen test on BD Veritor point-of-care system. And we continue to grow our pipeline of orders for syringes and needles to support future global vaccination campaigns. Third, as we continue to adapt and meet our customer needs, we also remain focused on the execution of our long-term strategy, which positions us well for the future. In addition to the COVID related solutions, we launched four additional products in the quarter and we remain on track to execute against our new product pipeline for fiscal year 2020. We are also continuing our work on Project Recode as part of our plans to simplify BD, which will help drive future operating margin expansion. We are confident that BD will emerge from this global health crisis from a position of strength and will continue to create and deliver value to all stakeholders. With that context, let's move on to our results for the third quarter including a review of the COVID impacts. As Tom discussed our third quarter performance reflects the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues declined 9.4% on a currency neutral basis. This was driven by approximately $600 million in net COVID headwinds, which impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 1400 basis points. As we shared previously, we saw significant impacts to our results in April and May. We were pleased that the sequential improvement we saw from May to June across our businesses continued into July with Q3 being the trough in terms of negative impact of COVID to our businesses. I'll discuss more regarding the trends across our businesses later in my presentation. Third quarter operating margins were 20.1%. This reflects the impact of high decremental margins on lost revenues due to COVID-19 as well as COVID-related investments. Adjusted EPS was $2.20, which represents a decline of 28.6% year-over-year or 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Following our $3 billion equity issuance in May, we retired both the $1.9 billion term loan and the $695 million we had outstanding on the revolver. Our liquidity position remains strong with $2.9 billion of cash as of June 30. Prior to the equity offering, we plan to pay down approximately $1 billion in debt in fiscal 2020 and we remain on track to do that. Combined with the revolver pay down in May, we will have paid down a combined $1.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020. Moving forward, we believe it's more meaningful to talk about our leverage on a net basis with leverage being 3.1 times net of cash as of June 30. Moving to Slide 13. Before I discuss our revenue performance by segment, I'd like to provide some color on the COVID impact in the third quarter. As we expected, continued adherence to COVID-related stay-at-home measures resulted in a decline in elective procedures and lower hospital admissions and procedure volumes as well as fewer routine lab tests and related specimen collections. In addition, we saw reduced demand from research labs due to closures. There are also some delays in capital instrument installations as facilities and staff were not easily accessible due to COVID. During our third fiscal quarter, these headwinds resulted in a gross impact of approximately $800 million to revenues. In terms of recovery, we are pleased to see sequential monthly improvement from May to June across our businesses and in some cases like elective procedures, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. Gross headwinds in the quarter were partially offset by approximately $200 million in COVID-related tailwinds. This was driven by strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and infusion pumps. As we anticipated demand for Alaris infusion pumps under medical necessity was significantly higher in the month of April compared to May and June. Now turning to slide 14 in the medical segment. BD Medical revenues declined 6% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 600 basis points. In the Medication Delivery Solutions unit, our performance reflects the impacts of declines in hospital admissions due to COVID, which resulted in fewer procedures. The majority of our MDS portfolio catheters flush and the like tracked closely to hospital admission trends. If we look at the U.S., as an example, admission rates were down most significantly in April. We saw a sequential improvement over the quarter exiting with admissions at approximately 80% to 85% of pre-COVID admission levels. Lower procedure volumes drove reduced customer demand and resulted in distributors rebalancing inventories in May and June following distributor stocking that took place during March and into April in the U.S. and Europe. MDS performance also reflects distributor inventory reductions and lower volumes related to the ongoing volume-based procurement process in China, which were in line with our expectations. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we saw an improvement in the impact related to COVID in China as the quarter progressed. Revenues in the Medication Management Solutions unit reflects strong demand for infusion pumps in the U.S. under medical necessity and strong growth outside the U.S. particularly in Europe. Within the quarter the majority of the U.S. medical necessity demand occurred in April as expected. This strength was partially offset by delayed capital installations of dispensing systems due to COVID as anticipated. And similar to our MDS portfolio, lower hospital admissions also impacted sales of infusion sets in MMS. Pharmaceutical Systems performance reflects our continued ability to meet high demand for pre-fillable syringes. Pharm systems third quarter revenues also reflect some timing of customer orders within the year. Year-to-date pharm systems revenues grew a strong 8.1% and we expect continued momentum in the fourth quarter. Third quarter performance in our Diabetes Care business reflects distributor and retailer reductions to inventories as expected after inventory increases that occurred towards the end of the second quarter due to customer stocking related to the COVID pandemic. Now turning to slide 15 and the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues declined 7.8% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID-19 of approximately 1,700 basis points. In Diagnostic Systems, growth was primarily driven by strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testings on the BD MAX platform. This was partially offset by a decline in routine diagnostic testing due to COVID. Results in pre-analytical systems were impacted by fewer specimen collections due to lower routine diagnostic testing. And in the Biosciences units performance reflects slower research and clinical lab activity due to COVID-19 that led to reduced demand for instruments and reagents. Now turning to slide 16 in the BD Interventional segment. Revenues decreased 19.2% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 3,000 basis points. Revenues in both the Peripheral Intervention and Surgery units were impacted by the deferral of elective procedures due to COVID. Within Peripheral Intervention, the impact of COVID was most notable within oncology across the U.S., Europe and China, as women delayed mammographies and in our ESKD and PAD platforms in the U.S. and Europe. Sequential improvement was seen during the quarter across all platforms. Revenues in China were flat year-over-year as the declines in oncology were offset by solid performances in End-Stage Kidney Disease and PAD. Within the Surgery unit the impact was primarily related to hernia repair and infection prevention in the U.S. and Europe as well as biosurgery in the U.S. Third quarter performance in Urology and Critical Care reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the acute urology portfolio due to lower hospital admissions. We continue to see solid performance in our targeted temperature management and home care portfolios. As Tom mentioned, China delivered positive growth in the month of June in all three BDI businesses. We are continuing to watch China's recovery closely. For your reference, we have included a slide in the appendix of today's deck that provides our total company third quarter results by geography. I'll now turn to slide 17 and our gross profit and operating margins for the third quarter. Gross profit margin of 51.7% declined 340 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects the impact of decremental margins of approximately 80% on lost revenues due to COVID headwinds in the quarter. This was driven by the mix of impacted revenues as well as the high fixed cost nature of our business which resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing variances which were expensed in the quarter.  The COVID impact to gross margin also reflects investments, we made in PPE facilities and the like to ensure the health and safety of our associates. The COVID impact was partially offset by gross margin leverage of approximately 50 basis points driven by our ongoing synergy and continuous improvement initiatives. Currency had negative impact of 50 basis points on gross margins in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.1% declined 480 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects the COVID impact to gross margin as well as additional operating expenses and investments related to COVID. This includes increased shipping cost investment in areas such as IT to support associates working from home, as well as new product development including our BD Veritor rapid diagnostic test. The COVID impact to operating margin was partially offset by operating expense leverage of approximately 70 basis points that reflects our ongoing discipline and initiatives to reduce expenses particularly within G&A. I'll provide more details on that in just a moment. Higher deferred compensation expense due to strong stock market performance in the quarter also negatively impacted operating margin in the third quarter. As a reminder deferred compensation expenses recorded within SSG&A and is entirely offset in the P&L in the other income net line item. Currency had a negative impact of 50 basis points on operating margin in the quarter. As we look forward we continue to expect COVID pressure on gross margins to improve as revenues return. However in the immediate term looking to the fourth quarter we continue to anticipate decremental margins of approximately 80% on related to COVID headwinds. Turning to Slide 18 which recaps the third quarter income statement, as discussed revenues declined 9.4%, this includes a 10 basis point decline and pricing in the quarter which was slightly better than anticipated. Gross margin was 51.7% as I discussed a moment ago. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25.4% including the expenses related to deferred compensation. As a reminder this is fully offset in other income. SSG&A expenses were down 6.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis or 8.9% excluding the impact from deferred compensation. This decrease reflects our ongoing expense discipline and the proactive measures we took to mitigate the impact of COVID. Some of these items include compensation reductions at the management level and suspension of the company's 401(k) match, as well as hiring restrictions. The decrease in SSG&A, also reflects lower T&E expenses as the majority of our associates continue to work virtually. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in innovation to support our COVID response plan and our long-term growth strategy despite COVID-19 pressures. Our third quarter tax rate was 5%. This was driven by discrete items that occurred within the quarter that were contemplated in our prior guidance range. For the full year we continue to expect our tax rate will be between 14% and 16% with a high teens rate in the fourth quarter. Preferred dividends on our BDX B shares that were issued during the quarter were $9 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.20 as previously discussed. This includes an FX headwind of $0.11 in the quarter which was more than we anticipated. As expected the expiration of the Gore royalty impacted adjusted EPS growth by about 580 basis points. As a reminder, we will anniversary the expiration of the Gore royalty this month. As we look forward we continue to monitor several macroeconomic factors and the potential impacts to our businesses. First, countries states and even localities are in various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result there is still great uncertainty regarding future infection levels, recovery rates and resurgence as well as general health care utilization. Second a continued weak macroeconomic environment will likely keep pressure on the overall healthcare system, utilization and consumer spending. Third the pace at which deferred procedures return to normal continues to be one of the biggest variables. This will depend on several factors including disease condition and acuity. COVID-19 testing availability, reopening and resurgence in countries around the world, and state-by-state within the U.S. and patient willingness to seek care. It's difficult to predict how that will all play out over the long term. And finally the timing effectiveness and timeline for potential COVID-19 vaccines around the world and the impact of the vaccine on surveillance testing is all yet to be determined. Looking forward while we are encouraged by the sequential improvement, we expect to continue to see unfavorable impacts from COVID-19 in our Surgery and Peripheral Interventional business due to elective procedures and we cannot anticipate the pace at which those procedures will fully return to normal. Moving on to the acute and non-acute area where our MMS, MDS and UCC businesses participate. We are continuing to monitor hospital admissions and utilization levels for both COVID and non-COVID patient care, as well as care in the non-acute setting. As we have shared previously we do not expect demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity to continue at the same level going forward. In diagnostics, we are continuing to monitor COVID and non-COVID testing volumes globally. As I mentioned earlier we anticipate continued strong demand for our BD MAX diagnostic test for COVID-19. Also as we expected we have seen very strong demand in our rapid point-of-care antigen test on the BD Veritor platform and we are working to scale up manufacturing of both our Veritor Readers and assays. And lastly in our Biosciences business, the pace of recovery will continue to depend on levels of research activity and clinical testing and how quickly they scale up to normal operations and capital spending. Now moving on to Slide 20, before we move on to our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the trends we saw during the third quarter related to the impact of COVID across our businesses. We shared this slide with you on our May earnings call which at that time depicted our results for April. This slide has been updated to reflect the third quarter COVID impact. When comparing the Q3 slide to the month of April, you'll note several things and I'd like to speak to two of those. First the quarter shows an improvement versus the month of April as the recovery continues to progress. The other trend worth noting is in our MDS business where we saw a larger COVID impact in May versus April. We saw improvement sequentially in June from the May low point. In total the COVID impact to our MDS business was approximately $200 million. On average in the third quarter, our businesses were impacted by approximately 25% to 40% versus our pre-COVID expectations. We exited the quarter with the month of June approximately 20% to 25% below pre-COVID expectations or said another way June had recovered to 75% to 80% of pre-COVID expectations. We were encouraged to see that exiting the third quarter and into July COVID headwinds started to abate and tailwinds started to improve. Note that we saw a sequential improvement in recovery rates in July versus June. Recovery rates across elective procedures, hospital admissions and routine testing range from 80% to 85% versus our pre-COVID expectations in the month of July. We are also seeing strong early demand for our Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen testing and continued demand for COVID-19 test on BD MAX. As expected there was a small amount of demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity as well as continued delays in large capital installations. Turning to slide 22, despite the continued variability and uncertainty due to the pandemic, we are providing a view into our revenue and EPS expectations for the remainder of the year based on what we are seeing today. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down low-single-digits and adjusted EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.60. As a result, we expect a revenue decline of a negative 2% to a negative 1.5% and EPS of $9.80 to $10 for the full fiscal year 2020. As a reminder, our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was a record quarter with over $730 million in sales in MMS, creating a very tough comparison. All in, we feel good about the remainder of the year based on the latest view of our business and assessment of macroeconomic environment. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to summarize the key messages from our presentation today. First, we continue to be uniquely positioned to respond to COVID-19 by leveraging our core capabilities across research, diagnosis and patient care. Despite a challenging and dynamic environment, our third quarter results reflect encouraging trends across our businesses in June. We have established a solid guidance range for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year as we have improved near-term visibility into our expected results. Based on what we know today, COVID-related headwinds appear to be abating and tailwinds are improving driven by high demand for BD Veritor. And lastly, we remain focused on executing on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver value to customers their patients and our shareholders around the world. Thanks, and I'd like to now open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: The floor is now for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Hey, guys.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Weinstein: Thanks for taking -- good morning. Thanks for taking the question. No surprise, I'll start out on antigen. Can you give us an idea a little bit more about the demand and where it's coming from. And we saw the HHS deal and we saw the news from the governors' consortium, I guess that was on Monday or Tuesday. But beyond that can you talk more about where you're seeing the demand start to come from? And your thoughts on the size of what that market could be considering between you and the other player there. There's going to be about 30 million tests per month in the market by next spring.\nTom Polen: Hey, Brian. This is Tom. Good morning. So as we mentioned earlier on the call, certainly demand is expected, as I think has been said by others, to exceed supply in the foreseeable future at least. And we certainly see that ourselves. Demand, as I mentioned before, is coming from many of our traditional customers, healthcare providers themselves. We've had quite strong demand there as well as non-traditional accounts. Nursing homes for us would have been a non-traditional account. We've seen announcements come out recently from states looking to acquire rapid antigen tests and the use in other settings. I think the value of near real-time 15-minute testing has gotten increasing traction. I'd say we've really seen the awareness of that increase over the last couple of weeks even more so. And that probably also coincides with increases in COVID rates across the country. So again, very, very strong demand, as I mentioned, both on the instrument side, which we've shipped already in the first month more than we normally would ship in a year. And our supply plans are on track to our ramp plans that we've shared before. But the demand is broad across both traditional and non-traditional segments.\nBrian Weinstein: Great, thanks for that. And then, as we think about a little bit longer-term here and start thinking about 2021, based on what you're seeing, can you talk about some things that we should be thinking about when evaluating how things could play out, especially considering the extended time line on Alaris, the recovery rates that you just mentioned currently being at about 80% to 85% of pre-COVID expectations in July and how COVID-19 testing could play out? Can you kind of give us some goalposts to be thinking about around those things and other things as we think about trying to factor in 2021 here?\nChris Reidy: Sure Brian. This is Chris and I'll start with that. And obviously normally on this call we get questions about the following year at this time of year and we hesitate to give any indications. This is probably even a tougher year to do that. We're giving guidance for the next two months, because we have a sense of the near-term visibility, but when you think about where things end up with hospital utilization and elective procedures of where does it top off, that's a tough one to call. Clearly we're seeing a good trend. We talked about that in our prepared remarks. June was better than May. July was better than June. So, that's a good indication. But where that tops out at, you see hospital utilization in that 80% to 85% range. Does it stay there? Does it get back to 100%? Those are the calls that you have to make. So that's a high variable and we'll be monitoring that obviously as we approach the November call. When you think about margins, clearly the decremental headwinds from COVID impact are strong 80%. And so, we're going to continue to see that with the -- into the fourth quarter. And then we'll have some lapping next year. But as that comes down, that headwind will lessen certainly over time. And then, on the more traditional stuff that we look at, FX right now looks like a push to slight tailwind. Resins, looks like it's a slight tailwind. We would expect to see some headwind in 2021 as we continue some of the COVID investments from this year and the full year impact of that. And on T&E, we are seeing some favorability from lower T&E. and we would expect that to carry over into the beginning of next year. And then we'll see with what kind of recovery, as people may be coming back from virtual work that might increase and have a little bit of pressure. Those are some of the things that you can start to think about, but it's a tough one to call this early. Thanks for the questions, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nTom Polen: Hi, David.\nDavid Lewis: I guess, Chris, I wonder if you could help us sort of better understand some of the key drivers into the fourth quarter. And then we obviously have Veritor interventional recovery and some comparable issues to consider. But maybe just sort of comment on some of the headwinds and tailwinds such as stocking dynamics, things that are harder for us to model. And we have the net COVID impact in the third quarter of $600 million. What does that impact look like in the fourth quarter? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nChris Reidy: Sure. So as we said, we are seeing those headwinds abate and you can see that trend through June and July. So we would expect that $600 million to come down significantly, but it's -- there still will be a headwind and so we have that and those headwinds do go down at the 80% level. So, I think, we've given you a lot of transparency into that. And so, that should help with the models. The biggest thing that I would point to in the fourth quarter that, I think, people have to remember, is the tough compare that we have particularly in MMS. And MMS had a record quarter at $738 million; as I mentioned in the prepared remarks last year, and that's a real tough grow over. And so, with that, the decremental margins being 80% on the COVID impact, that's significant. I think the other is that there are COVID operational investments that we have. Those will continue and drag into the quarter. And the other thing to remember about the fourth quarter is, generally, if you think about the Alaris ship hold, that's certainly impacting us again. The demand on the medical necessity, we're not expecting that to be what it was in the third quarter. So those are the kinds of things that we look at in the fourth quarter to get to the guidance that we gave. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. And then, Tom, just a quick question on Alaris. The following is, sort of, six months push versus the prior September, which is actually kind of consistent with our expectation. But with factor testing, kind of, in the bag here, what are the biggest outstanding deliverables in the submission? And timing aside, I think, investors are most focused on what's your level of confidence you can return a safe pump to market. Thanks so much.\nTom Polen: Okay. Dave, thanks for the question. So we -- as I mentioned before, we have completed quite a bit of the testing and other work required for the submission and we have a much better visibility to submission timing than we did and when we gave you update last, in May. I think from a human factor testing, we still have the other part of it. We did the -- we've completed 100% of our formative testing, which is the initial phase. Again, 12 different human factor tests, as I described, and we're pleased with the data and outcome. Now we've got to progress to that next stage, which is a broader set of testing. So that's still in front of us. A little bit of some of the other testing that we have completed. We've completed a retrospective risk assessment on the changes that have -- every change that's been made to the Alaris system since the initial 510(k). That work is almost complete. We see that as retiring significant risk to the submission. We've completed software verification based on the original scope, closing out most outstanding anomalies. Of course, that software is not going to be released until all of our integrated testing is complete. But this is -- that's a tremendous amount of work and a testament to the team being agilely working from home. I think the other area is, V&V and reliability testing. So we're pleased with our progress there, good progress made on both fronts, but we've -- we're at -- we've begun testing on selected components in certain types of tests. And we await feedback from the FDA on the overall set of protocols. And so, at this point, that testing is -- it's not necessarily that workstream on a critical path for the overall project, but it's still more testing that's in front of us. Just to give a little bit more color of the testing that remains. So, thanks for the question. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. And Tom your confidence, you can return a safe pump to market here, timing aside, regardless of timing.\nTom Polen: We don't -- we remain very confident in the safety of the Alaris product. And as I said, we've been working very collaboratively with the FDA on advancing this submission. So, we feel good about that progress that we're making. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. \nKristen Stewart: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, I was just wondering, how we should think about gross margins going forward, just as we balance some of the decremental margins, as you've talked about, just with the Veritor assay coming in, as you've talked about the different capacity coming online and then think about kind of the puts and takes that you've talked about with FX and resin and everything else. I appreciate you've had a lot of moving parts here, but it seems that we should have continued pressure but obviously some moving parts particularly as we think about modeling, out next quarter and even thinking about 2021. \nChris Reidy: Sure. So thanks for the question, Kristen. We're looking at Q4 margins in the 54% to 55% kind of range. And when you're thinking beyond that, also remember that there's continued higher shipping costs as well. And you know what, we've been able to continue to drive leverage. In the charts that we gave on the third quarter, we broke it out where you could actually see the impact from the decremental margins from COVID. So we'll still have some of that, as we described earlier. We'll have some -- so that impact will lessen as the impact of COVID lessens in the fourth quarter. And that's why we get from that 51-ish percent kind of range up to the mid-54s. And in the mix as well, is the COVID investments that we have, as well as our ability to continue to drive underlying leverage through continuous improvement. So that gets you kind of to that 54% to 55% range. One other thing that I neglected to mention earlier in the question regarding Q4 is, also you saw the lumpiness of our tax rate. Those discrete items were anticipated for the year, but a lot of them fell into the third quarter. So as you're modeling the fourth quarter, you would expect to see a high-teens Q4 tax rate. And then, also keep in mind, the preferred shares and the dividend and that's what leads you to that $2.40 to $2.60 kind of EPS range.\nKristen Stewart: Okay. And then, that 54% to 55%, does that seem like a reasonable number to think about as a jumping off point, as we think about 2021 as well? Obviously, recognizing there's a lot going on with COVID and whatnot, but a reasonable point to look forward to...\nChris Reidy: There's certainly is a lot going on. But yes, I think that's a reasonable jumping off point. So that's why we're trying to give you -- on that chart we're trying to break down the various contributors. So as the COVID impact abates you can -- that's a big driver at 80%. So as that goes away it starts coming. It starts improving. Again and again, we feel really good about the fact that we're able to on an underlying basis continue to drive improvements through, continuous improvements and synergies. And as we mentioned, Recode is a project that we will continue and think about that as a continuation of the simplification of the combinations of the companies that we've had over the number of years.\nKristen Stewart: Okay. Thanks so much.\nChris Reidy: Thank you, next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Hi.\nChris Reidy: Good morning, Rick.\nRick Wise: Good morning.\nSimon Campion: Good morning.\nRick Wise: Good morning, Simon and Hi Chris. You're going to be surprised to hear me say, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2022.\nSimon Campion: That's a first forward looking.\nRick Wise: I know, that's right, but I thought, you said. I do -- I'm not looking for guidance but more just reflect -- if I reflect on things, it seems reasonable to think that fiscal 2022 might be a year when that thing gets more back to normal, the economy hopefully recovering, volumes returning, maybe a vaccine all sorts of things testing in better shape. And my question really revolves around that return to growth, and how you, Tom and Chris are thinking about Becton. How would you have us think about Becton and what may be a more normal year? Does that -- if we assume that fiscal 2022, is a more normal year you return to fiscal 2019 or 2018, kind of mid-single-digit top line low double-digit bottom line. Or do we think, because of things like Project Recode, all the cost reduction the efficiency, the new products, the expanded testing, that actually maybe your normalized growth as we think a little longer term about the company is actually a little better or you're a little more optimistic. I think that maybe, it'd be interesting to hear your thoughts.\nChris Reidy: Sure. I'll take a start at that. And then, I'm sure Tom will chime in with his view. But you're absolutely right. 2021 is going to be a mixed bag. And the compare is very different. So as you think about 2022, as we think about it, we're still very much focused on the five plus on the top and the 10 plus on the bottom. And all of what you talked about in some of the growth drivers go towards, getting to that five plus on a sustainable basis. So we feel really good about the underlying business, the sustainability of that, mid-single digits kind of five plus kind of growth on the top. And things like Recode are designed to get us that kind of multiple to get you to the 10% on the bottom, on a sustainable basis. So we feel good about it getting back to that kind of level. And we feel good about the fact that where the business is on an underlying basis, performing extremely well in the face of all of the COVID impact that, we've had. And that is lessening. As we said, we see those headwinds abating. Now obviously that could change, with the change in the course of the pandemic. We're just calling that based on what we see today and so that does seem to be abating somewhat. And you've seen some of the tailwinds that have been increasing. But again, how much of that continues into 2022 will play out over time.\nTom Polen: And maybe I think, Chris that was very well said. I think Rick maybe the only thing I could add is, our -- we are running the company. Obviously we're managing it through COVID, but we are very much executing not only our short-term opportunities areas like Veritor and MAX and helping on the vaccination campaign around the world, but very much executing our long-term strategy. And so, as we think about for example our new product development pipeline and how we've been executing it, I've shared in the past, we've been really focused on continuing to improve our on-time delivery of products or on-time milestones. This year despite COVID we're going to improve. We're very much on track to improve our performance year-on-year again this year, even better than we had last year. Really proud of how the team is executing that. We just finished our strategic portfolio review. And we went through all the segments. And we're making those tough trade-offs, in terms of which programs give us the best returns and growth profiles going forward. And we're allocating and making sure those investments are continuing or adding in new opportunities that we see. And we're executing those pipelines on the Recode, as I mentioned. We've allocated resources to that this year. They're executing they're on track. And even in areas like our plant I continue to be astounded. In the middle of managing -- with our large manufacturing scale, you can imagine the complexity that COVID adds in. We watch our supplier base, a huge team that's just watching suppliers and any economic challenges they have. And how do we start preparing for backup suppliers to make sure there\u2019s no interruption in our supply chain. A lot of that is incremental, going on in COVID. And even during that, right our operations team is very focused on continuing to deliver, the routine CI savings. And they're again doing very well on that this year, incremental to the work that they're doing on COVID. And so, hopefully the takeaway from that is that, we are managing and navigating COVID with a high level of discipline, while at the same time, maintaining very much so our execution discipline on the long-term strategy.\nChris Reidy: And the only thing I would add from a slightly different perspective too is, given the level of uncertainty what you can count on us is a, high level of transparency. And I think -- I hope you'd agree that what we just gave on the third quarter and into July is very transparent. We've been very clear as to what we expect in the fourth quarter from Veritor for example. We'll go to great pains to break that out, so that as we navigate through that, it will be very clear, what's coming from Veritor. And what's coming from the base business.\nTom Polen: And MAX.\nRick Wise: Yeah. The disclosure there's something and we all appreciate it. Just as a quick follow-up if I could. Chris, you highlighted the 3.1 times net leverage on June 30th. Last quarter you said, post-Bard leverage reduction timing was pushed out. Maybe just help us understand what's your latest thinking there? Where are you heading? And what's that all mean for capital allocation? Thanks a lot.\nChris Reidy: Sure. So nothing's really changed from a standpoint of our intent to delever the company. I think with the pandemic, as we've discussed right now, we're focused on cash. We're continuing to pay down deb. But at the same time, that net leverage, the gross leverage has been pushed off a little bit but we will continue to work that down over time. We feel good about the fact that the net leverage is where it's at. So that really hasn't changed. We'll see --we feel really well positioned in this time of uncertainty from a cash and liquidity standpoint. And as we've talked about that that gives us the firepower to invest in new products, invest in things like Veritor protection for example. And so it gives us the firepower to do that. It will continue to fuel M&A of tuck-in acquisitions et cetera. So we feel really good about the balance sheet. As we come out, as you think about 2022 for example, our overall capital allocation really hasn't changed. The good news is we do throw off a lot of cash and so we feel good about our dividend. We've had a long history of increasing the dividend. We've continued that through everything. I think you can expect that from us going forward as well. I look forward to the day when pandemics and the --this is sort of behind us and that strong cash generation leads us to a point where we can start buying back shares again. And we will come to that and get through this period. But the overall capital allocation really hasn't changed. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nTom Polen: Good morning, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Good morning. We can all take your supply of the Veritor antigen test and MAX out against the ASP and we can come up with really big numbers over the next 12-plus months. How should -- how do you want to frame the revenue potential in fourth quarter and even into next year as you're sitting here? I know you haven't given guidance for next year but what's your latest base case thinking on antigen testing for COVID over the next 12 months or so?\nChris Reidy: So I'll start with --just to be very clear on the fourth quarter, we have talked about the 10 million tests and that is what is in our guidance is the 10 million tests. So we said that the demand for that is very strong. We feel good about our ability to produce that at that level. But that's what's in the guidance for the fourth quarter. And longer term I'll turn it to Tom.\nTom Polen: Yes. And we've shared as we think about the fourth quarter right we assume the 10 million tests July through September at about $20 ASP per test, which is what we had shared in the -- historically. As you think about 2021, obviously it's going to depend upon -- the number one factor will be the intensity of the COVID pandemic and its duration timing of vaccine et cetera. And so I think the most that we can focus on is that we will --the 8 million tests per month by the end of September. And then we'll be ramping up production of more than -- right at 12 million tests per month at the end of February. Those are the numbers. The percent utilization of those is to be determined as things evolve. We want -- we don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on that at this point in time. \nRobbie Marcus: Okay. Thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up. You answered this briefly before on capital allocation but you raised some capital during the quarter. Part of that was to have potential firepower to go on the offensive for M&A should that come up. What's your latest view on where M&A would be most appropriate in the portfolio? What you view the current environment like? And do you think there are willing sellers out there right now?\nTom Polen: Thanks, Robbie. So I would just say, as we've shared in the past, we always are evaluating and have historically. Tuck-in M&A has been a long part of BD's history in how we've grown many of the businesses that exist in the company from BDB to Vacutainer to of course --much of the Bard portfolio came in through tuck-in acquisitions and licensing inorganically. We continue to look at opportunities across all three of the segments and we're very focused on deals that we would look at. We're not -- as we've made very, very clear we have zero interest in any large transformational deals. We won't be doing those. We're looking at tuck-ins, which is traditionally what BD has done going back in time and has been critical to Bard. We prioritize very much and are looking at accretive deals. We're not looking at --we have zero interest in any significant dilution at all. So those are some of the key criteria I'd say we're looking at. Specific areas as I've shared before, we're not looking at areas far aside from our existing businesses. We're looking to leverage where we have strengths and competitive advantage and really rounding out those portfolios as we've done again in each of the three segments over time. And Chris anything to add? \nChris Reidy: Yes. No nothing to add other than to emphasize that the key metrics there are strategic fit in our core businesses and non-dilutive accretive deals. We're not looking for a lot of dilution. And returns -- ROIC greater than the cost of capital in year four .Those are the kind of standard metrics we look at. But first and foremost a strategic fit.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Robbie.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. \nTom Polen: Good morning, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for taking my question. One, just maybe a cleanup question on Q4 Chris. The tailwinds that you guys saw in 3Q $200 million, obviously the pump revenues go away for Q4. Are the tailwinds also decreasing for Q4? And I think you made a comment on the preferred dividends and share count. Perhaps, could you just remind us really on, what we should be expecting for share count in preferred dividends in Q4? \nChris Reidy: So let me take the first part of that. So just to make it clear I mean, we said that the $600 million in the last quarter we're modeling in the area of around $200 million net impact in Q4. And we do expect the tailwinds to go up with Veritor. We --Tom gave the number 10 times 20, so that's $200 million. We expect --I think we noted in the charts we expect BD MAX to be another $100 million as we -- impacts out there. And you would expect the Alaris to be --medical necessity to come down from third quarter to fourth quarter. So when you net all that out and with the abatement of the headwinds that we're seeing in elective procedures, hospital utilization going up a little bit still not back to normal but abating that's kind of where our thinking is. And the --I missed the last part of your question but I think it was Q4 share count. And you could use in your models about $293 million. \nVijay Kumar: Okay. That's extremely helpful for us. And just on one fiscal 2021 then. Tom, we can do the math -- like Chris said on the Veritor antigen test. But more stepping outside of numbers, it just feels that from your comments stepping up on capacity for these antigen tests. It feels like you guys are a little bit perhaps more incrementally bullish on the prospects for antigen test. Is that the right way to look at it? And syringes, obviously, you saw the orders for that. Is there a dollar number, sort of, what The Street could monitor for 2021? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yes. On antigen tests, I think, what's fair to say is that we've seen as I mentioned very strong demand right off the bat. I mean we're only -- we're literally at a month today. It's the anniversary. And we have very strong -- extremely strong demand on that product both on the Readers antigen tests themselves. I think what's very, very clear is there is a high need to know this person have COVID right now. And I don't want to wait a day I don't want to wait two days, three days, four days depending on how the system -- how effective the testing system is if you're sending samples out, you can get up to those durations. And I think there's a whole need where that just doesn't work that type of testing turnaround time and people -- high value on this getting an answer within 15 minutes. So that's -- and that ease of use there is unbeatable on the antigen testing approach. So right we're very focused on -- a we've been engaging a wide range of customers on that. As I mentioned, we've -- we're deploying not just the resources of life sciences, but of BD against that opportunity on the scale-up and making sure we have the right infrastructure to support the broader base of customers. Even logistically right shipping this volume out of product, and so again we're applying the full capabilities of the company behind this. So I think that's a fair approach to it. How that evolves again from a disease prevalence rate and consumption through 2021 no one knows the answer to that. But as long as it exists I would expect there's going to be a high need for antigen tests. \nVijay Kumar: Just on the syringes, Tom. \nTom Polen: Yes. On syringes as you said you heard us we gave a number on this call that was incremental to the number we gave last time right? So we have continued orders coming in not only in the U.S. but in other parts of the world. We think that's still relatively -- no change from what we had shared historically, right that we have capacity to add one billion units over the next -- we had always shared 12 months to 18 months. And we still see that opportunity side. I did call out right the devices that we are selling are a mix of safety devices and conventional devices. Safety devices have a bit higher ASP than conventional devices. So we'll see how that mix evolves over time. But overall, we're right in line. We're still on track to be able to produce that one billion units over the next 12 months to 18 months. And you can see right at over 450 million or -- well 470 million units right those orders are starting to come in quite steadily. I think that answer..\nVijay Kumar: Yeah. Okay. \nTom Polen: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. \nBob Hopkins: Great. \nTom Polen: Good morning, Bob.\nChris Reidy: Good morning, Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Good morning. So thanks. I just have two questions and I'll include them upfront. Given the kind of focus on testing I was wondering if you could -- just to be clear what was the total COVID testing revenue in Q3. And what is total COVID testing revenue assumed in the Q4 guide? And then the other thing I'd love you to comment on is that the one kind of incoming e-mails I've gotten on this report more than anything else is just that Q4 earnings are way below where The Street was guiding and it's about an $0.80 year-over-year decline, 25% year-over-year decline. So if you wouldn't mind trying to just, sort of, break that down for us those $0.80. And you've mentioned a bunch of things on the call today. But I was wondering if you could just summarize the factors that are leading to that kind of $0.80 year-over-year decline and the kind of $0.50 below or so what The Street was modeling. \nChris Reidy: Sure. So let me start on the first part of your question was the COVID-related testing that we saw in Q3. That was $100 million on MAX. So think about $100 million on MAX and $100 million on the Alaris medical necessity or thereabouts. So that was the $200 million of tailwinds that we were talking give or take. On Q4, we've talked I think you can think about that $100 million going up to $300 million because the MAX is if we're running at full capacity and so we expect that to be about $100 million in Q4 and then you add in the Veritor of 10 million x 20. So that's $200 million gets you to the $300 million kind of thing. So moving on to the second part of your questions. I think again the revenue decline we're still seeing low single digits kind of a decline in the fourth quarter. I think the COVID impact particularly in the MDS business in Q3 was something that folks had been missing is very much driven by hospital utilization and you saw what that was. So we would expect that to continue because although utilization is getting better it's still under pressure. And so we do expect that revenue decline of low single-digits. Then you drop that at a decremental GP. I think on the last call, we were signaling kind of in the 75% range. It's really coming in closer to the 80% range. And again that's a testament to the fact that these are very high-margin products that are being impacted by COVID. And then in addition, we're doing the right things in terms of not building inventory during this period of time. And that's a very important point because as you're not building inventory, you've got absorption of variances that come in and hit the quarter. And we're taking that charge this quarter. We're not capitalizing it in inventory and carrying it forward. So that is a big part of what gets you up to the 80%. Obviously we're making COVID investments as well. And those investments range from what you would anticipate in terms of cleaning and those kinds of, things PPE those will continue. But in addition it would include all the work we're doing to scale the Veritor and the MAX. And so those are some investments we're making. I think the other thing that the -- would be new news compared to your models is the tax rate. And as we think about Q3 earnings the $2.20, we acknowledge the fact that that's -- is probably $0.20 of tax benefit there. But in addition compared to what we were expecting and what I think The Street was expecting the drag from FX was about twice what we would have thought at $0.11. So I think when you do that we're kind of in line with The Street for the third quarter. Then as you think about the fourth quarter though our range for the tax rate for the year isn't changing. So that just assumes a very high-teens tax rate in the fourth quarter. So I think when you plug that in and then you do the calculation for the preferred shares all of that kind of gets you into the range where we're at.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thanks for the detail.\nChris Reidy: Hopefully that helps. \nBob Hopkins: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nChris Reidy: Good morning, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Good morning, Chris. One on testing or just actually two on testing. I'll ask them both upfront. As people have said on this call, we can do the math on the potential sales. I guess, my question is we also know the margin is relatively high. I don't know, if you would bless kind of a 75% incremental operating margin or not, but that's kind of what people believe. So the EPS contribution could be quite high, if the demand is strong. So I guess my question is will you let this drop to the bottom line? How should we think about that versus reinvesting? And then just, Tom, I know you don't know how sustainable the testing is. But long term once we have COVID under control is Veritor for COVID similar to kind of flu, which is about $100 million per year? Or is there any reason why this could be a greater long-term opportunity? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTom Polen: So let me start with the last question then Chris can discuss the margins, which by the way we have shared. We're not sharing the specific margins of Veritor, but we have said that they're higher than the company average I think is the comment that we've shared in the past and probably what we're comfortable to continue to share, which is to your point. So on the long-term opportunity for COVID testing, I think again very difficult to predict at this point in time. I think, there's still a lot of uncertainties, even around the vaccine. Are you --is it going to be a permanent vaccine? Is it going to be a vaccine that you have to get every year more like the flu, I think those things will --if it's something like polio that gets eradicated because of a vaccine that you get a couple of shots of it upfront and then it's longer term that obviously will lead to a very different outcome than if it's something that you have to get annually. And if you forego that annual vaccination then now you're susceptible to get COVID. These things, I think are still being understood and will evolve. What I think we can say is that look we're placing a lot of Veritor instruments right now, and I shared that upfront in my commentary around demand just for the instruments in the first quarter. We certainly see point-of-care diagnostics as an area of focus of investment for the company and we have I think an example a clear indicator of that is we acquired a point-of-care molecular company earlier this year pre-COVID coming up. Because we saw the attractiveness of this space and we're continuing to invest in that area very heavily. I think the broader footprint of Veritors out in the marketplace, could you say regardless of how COVID evolves will that create a bigger opportunity for Veritor of consumption of --how long COVID will last is an unknown, but will they be using will there be more people out available to use flu strep other tests on Veritor? And will there be a societal continued shift to want to have testing results faster than they were before COVID happened. And I think those are all trends that I do think are going to be more permanent after COVID. Point of care is an area that, I would say, we are increasingly bullish on overall as a market. People understand now. Of course, people, a lot of people understand lab testing a lot more now than they did pre-COVID, because they have a lot more interest. And when you --understanding too when you have to wait days to get a result when you really need to know the answer, I think people also understand the value of that point-of-care technology. And so we do see that as a long-term trend and it's an area of continued investment. And we see some near-term opportunities that could continue to prevail for Veritor due the larger placement base. And then of course, we are continuing to invest in new technologies in that space as well.\nChris Reidy: And back to the first part of your question, I think it is fair to say, and we have said in the past that the margins here would be higher than the company margins. I think some of the numbers you're quoting seem a little rich to me particularly in the short term. This fourth quarter, I don't think you can expect us to ramp production and immediately get to those kind of margins in the fourth quarter. So I think some --the models that I've seen have just assumed we can get to those kind of margins day one. That's not practical, but clearly building over time to margins that are higher than the company average.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, guys.\nChris Reidy: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nTom Polen: Hi, Amit. Good morning.\nChris Reidy: Hey, Amit.\nAmit Hazan: Let me --just a couple of quick ones. I know we're running late on time here. I wanted to ask the first one on just routine testing and get a sense from you, if the recovery there is similar to what you cited elsewhere. And even if we think about getting into not just diagnostics but even PI oncology and things like mammo whether you have any insight to the pace of that recovery? It just all seems very relevant to downstream procedure revenue?\nTom Polen: Yeah. We --let me start with that. This is Tom, Amit. And actually we do have Simon on the phone as well. We have all of our segment presidents. And Simon, I'll ask you to comment on the oncology piece in a moment. I know that was one that we did see a little bit more impact in COVID than some of the other procedure areas as mammographies have been delayed. But just before we get to that, when it comes to actually more laboratory-based testing IVD testing that is one that we recognize that non-COVID diagnostic testing and specimen collection improved from about 75% in June to about 80% in July One of the indicators that, we look at very closely are the national reference lab volumes and I think it's fair to say that the information that they share in terms of overall underlying testing demand correlates very well with demand signals that we see in our Vacutainer business, which is of course a large business for us on the diagnostic testing side. Obviously, our IDS business gets a little bit more fluctuated because it is an infectious disease diagnostic testing. It's gotten both MAX and now going forward Veritor. And so we'll see more fluctuations there. But as we think about our PAS business very much we see the impact there correlated with what you would see in national reference labs. And the commentary that, they have around increased improvements from June to July match right with what we've seen as well. Simon maybe some further comments on the procedure side?\nSimon Campion: Yeah. Good morning. So certainly with oncology we did see an impact over the quarter, but month-by-month, we saw sequential growth as well. So it was slightly heavier impacted than some other parts of the PI business. But we also completed a survey. We actually surveyed 815 of our interventional customers of which 119 were involved in oncology. And most of our business as in oncology is either a implant or ports or biopsy and we've recently gone into interventional oncology. And what they're saying is that -- we've got interesting information that the patients that they've been treating are -- is a good mix between rescheduled cases and new cases. And these customers are also saying that their office volumes are beginning to rebound and they have a positive outlook as to what office volumes look like over the next 60 to 90 days. So while it was impacted the funnel was certainly impacted earlier on during COVID the outlook remains reasonably positive for oncology as well as other parts of the business too. \nAmit Hazan: That's great. And Tom one for you on vaccination if I can. I'm just understanding dynamics a little bit better. Obviously, there's just a whole bunch of vaccine companies now going at risk at the same time. They're building inventory ahead of data, two doses per vaccine generally. And obviously that could suggest demand that -- for actual syringes that could be several multiples greater than population size. You've obviously made the comments today again about the one billion in incremental synergies --syringes over the next 12 to 18 months and the Bard investment taking 12 months. And you're obviously the biggest syringe player in the world. So the question is are we heading for supply challenges with regard to syringes injection devices for COVID vaccination? \nTom Polen: Yes. I can't answer that. We don't know. At this point we are -- we've got visibility to supply the orders that we've received is a fair way to say it right? We don't as I mentioned that one billion units we've gotten 470 million units' worth of demand on that. And when I said the one billion units, right we mean that as truly incremental to just our ongoing demand remaining the same. And so that is another factor. Of course, we make way more than one billion units. We make billions of units a year of syringes on a global basis. And we're assuming all that base gets consumed normally. That includes a strong flu vaccination campaign that we would have syringes sufficient to provide that. And then this is incremental to that. And so right people will have to make choices. People could say I don't know if that's true that all those -- the base syringe consumption would remain normal that people wouldn't reallocate the syringes for other purposes in that. But there is a large base of other syringes that we're providing to the market as well. So what we can say right now is the current visibility of demand that's coming in from governments around the world is still within our supply capabilities. \nAmit Hazan: Thanks.\nTom Polen: Good question. It's something we're obviously watching closely as well. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. \nLarry Keusch: Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom I wanted to just go back to Alaris and just kind of think through the time line a little bit relative to the update that you provided today. I think as I sort of recount how this came about when the issues first came up you were sort of talking about an early fourth quarter FDA filing. And then of course given the pandemic and challenges with human factor testing that pushed out again. So I'm just trying to square now that we think about the revised timing what sort of changed? Do you need to do more testing than you initially thought as you got into deeper discussions with the FDA? Is there something that you're doing incremental that you believe puts you in a better position. You obviously talked about the end tidal CO2. And does the observations of the manufacturing facility also sort of play into the time line as you think about it? \nTom Polen: Okay. Good question, Larry. So first-off, we had always shared that the original assumption was end of Q4 right? And obviously with -- that was pre-COVID pandemic and we indicated that that would have impacts on our ability to do the testing. And it has and we recognize that. As I shared we've completed quite a bit of the testing and we had shared that versus when we had given an update in May that we felt that we would have quite a bit of that testing done by now and that we'd have much better visibility in our submission time line and that is the case. And it's the basis upon which we've given the update today. As I answered I think it was David's question earlier on this topic I'd already walked through the testing that we've done on human factor testing as well as some of the other testing that's been completed.  In terms of incremental things, we have continued to have dialogue with the FDA and understand their feedback. So that's been part of the process. And that's been a really strong part of the process our collaboration with the FDA and it's something that we think is very important to get aligned on the testing. So that when again we submit the actual 510(k) that we're in a position to make it as comprehensive as possible so that the FDA is put in a position to be able to give us as timely of an approval hopefully as is possible that we do our best job in enabling that. The one thing that is added in -- and there may be others. But certainly one thing that I mentioned is the EtCO2 module which was in development before but we did make the decision that based on feedback from the FDA and where the technology ultimately came out in development that as we are working in parallel with our product development road map we made the decision to include that update in the 510(k) module. As I mentioned it monitors patients on ventilators while medication is being administered. And given the importance of having this in generation module in, we felt it was the best decision and the FDA agreed to include that in the filing. Just on the 483 itself that you brought up what I would say there is that resolving the 483 items, the 510(k) submission is not contingent upon that specifically. And so maybe what I can just make a couple of comments on that is that we have been separately from the 510(k) submission work we've been continuing our remediation efforts associated with that Form 483 that we mentioned on our last call. In addition to providing a comprehensive response to the FDA we've already begun taking actions. That includes initiating a voluntary field action at the end of June and another earlier this week that we announced. And so we're going to continue to take action including initiating program changes process improvements and field actions when necessary in a way that provides the best-in-class support to our customers and minimizes disruptions to patient care which is more important than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic. So, as I said before we continue to stand behind the safety of the product which continues to provide significant clinical benefits to patients and health care providers. And as I said before to be clear the timing of our 510(k) filing is not dependent on resolving every item in the 483. We are taking all appropriate actions to ensure that comprehensive 510(k) submission as we also work in parallel to resolve the 483 observations.\nLarry Keusch: Okay. Terrific. Thanks. That's all I had.\nTom Polen: Great. Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Matt.\nChris Reidy: Good morning, Matt.\nMatt Taylor: Hey, good morning. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about the installation progress and time line. You called out the fact that hospitals are not allowing a lot of large capital installations and there's been some tempering of the appetite there. I'm just wondering what the funnel looks like. Are you seeing any cancellations? And when do you think that will pick up relative to the improvement in utilization?\nChris Reidy: Sure. So clearly, the -- where we saw that the most was access to facilities and installation. And that was certainly true in April and May. I think we commented that in June that we saw that getting better. And we certainly saw that to be the case in July as well. So it really has to do -- what we've seen thus far is really more access related than any lack of appetite for installations. We haven't seen any cancellations that were other than deferrals. And so we haven't seen that. Certainly that's something that is -- I talked about as our watch outs going forward. But at this stage, we haven't seen that manifest itself yet. It's really just about the installations at this point.\nMatt Taylor: And then just to follow-up on that. Conversely the negative impact on demand from hospital operations, do you think that the continued stimulus being given to hospitals could help you in some of these areas? Is there encourage to spend it on COVID-related things?\nChris Reidy: Yes. Clearly, that's the case. And I think that's what's helped bridge a lot of hospitals from a cash flow standpoint. So I think those programs have certainly helped from that standpoint. So absolutely. \nMatt Taylor: Thank you very much.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nTom Polen: Hey, Josh.\nChris Reidy: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning, Tom and Chris. I just wanted to ask about China. I think they're ahead of the curve in terms of the COVID recovery. You guys were down 17%. The China business in fiscal 3Q seems like medical was the biggest anchor in China. Anything you can do just division-by-division to help us understand the impact in fiscal 3Q? And then what's assumed for China guidance in fiscal fourth quarter? And then I just have one really quick follow-up. \nChris Reidy: Yes. So one thing I would mention and I think we mentioned it in our prepared remarks is that across BDI for example we were positive in June. And so we are watching China as we said very closely. And we are seeing some recovery there. Bear in mind that we also have in China in the medical area that you mentioned in the medical segment that we do have the impact of the volume-based procurement. So we did see -- I think also in our prepared remarks, we said that we continue to see some of that distributor stocking impact -- destocking impact as we go through that. Really no news on that volume-based procurement. That continues. It's a continuous thing. But outside of that, the recovery is happening in China and improving across the businesses.\nJosh Jennings: Great. Thanks. And then just on the pump business medical necessity. It was a tailwind in fiscal 3Q. I believe you mentioned when you called out April on your fiscal 2Q call that the run rate in fiscal 2Q for medical necessity was around $10 million for the quarter. Is that the normal run rate outside of the COVID tailwind on the quarter? \nChris Reidy: Yes. I'm not sure what you're referring to there because we're -- there is no normal run rate on medical necessity. That was something new. We did mention I think in the quarter in April, I think we might have noted how much that was. And I think we said, it was in the $70 million kind of range for medical necessity. And as I mentioned, the quarter was in the $100 million kind of range. And so obviously May and June were significantly lower than April. And I think -- and we're not expecting too much in the fourth quarter in terms of medical necessity. And obviously, that's a function of resurgence and everything else, but we're not anticipating anything significant there.\nJosh Jennings: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just one question. I'm curious can you give any color on where this initial demand that you said is very high for point of care, where what sectors of the economy? Or what types of uses are you seeing the highest levels of that elevated demand for this type of test? Just trying to get a feel for kind of where this is probably going to have the biggest use. And if you have any initial comments there? Thanks very much.\nTom Polen: Richard this is Tom. Good question. As I had shared before, it is a broad sector of both traditional customers and customers who are new to us where this demand is coming from. And we also of course a lot of this given the -- of course our traditional customers we often are engaging with them directly. So think about hospitals and clinics and those types of locations. We are dealing with them directly and we see strong demand from those areas. We of course are also providing this product through most all the major distributors and they are mostly directly managing a broader nontraditional customer base who are approaching them or calling us and then we refer them through distributors. The ship-tos are much broader than we would ever be set up to manage directly and we typically sell Veritor through distributors anyway. But there it's -- as you saw I mean HHS announced acquiring for nursing homes. Normally that's a whole new customer segment. It's normally not doing Veritor point-of-care testing as an example. There are schools that in states that are buying them to test symptomatic kids when they're in the -- as they're thinking about starting up school. What if a kid says I've got X Y Z symptoms that mimic COVID what do you do? Do you send them home and wait a couple of days to get a test result? Or is it really important for you to know if that kid has COVID before they leave the building, so that you can determine what do you do with all the other kids and the teachers that were in that classroom with that child. These are the questions that the people are working through. We've had employers order the product for similar types of purposes in use of understanding, again if employees come up with symptoms et cetera while at work. How you triage and make decisions for the rest of the workforce that's there and helping keep the environment safe? So those are just a few of the examples that we see the testing. But hopefully, just gives a color that it is much more diverse base than would traditionally be doing flu or strep or our normal point-of-care test.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning guys. This is Andrew [ph] on for Jason. Thank you for taking the questions. I just have two real quick ones here and I'll ask them both upfront. Any updated thoughts on the BTK Lutonix product? How are you preparing for a rollout strategy at this point? And then the second one is I know it's super early, but any updated or any thoughts you can offer on the upcoming flu season, any challenges, headwinds, tailwinds anything that we need to contemplate in our model? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yes, Andrew, good question. On BTK, so we have nothing in our outlook in Q4 for BTK. I think we shared that in the past, but just to reiterate that. Of course, we have -- last we had shared is that we had submitted additional information as part of that PMA review and it continues to be under active review by the FDA. But we'll provide an update as we hear information from the FDA on that, but nothing to share at this point in time. In terms of the flu season, as I mentioned, we're making sure that first off that we have product to help support the flu vaccination campaigns this year. Obviously, we\u2019re also expect to continue to provide flu testing on the Veritor platform. And as I mentioned, we are -- we do have combination COVID-flu tests in development on both our MAX and our Veritor platform. And so those are -- we have teams actively working on both of those to support where we could have flu and COVID needing differential diagnosis as that season intensifies going forward. The other thing that we watch is -- and no one knows the answer to this. We have seen some evidence that the incidences of using PPE and social distancing and quarantine have reduced the rate of -- or the intensity of the flu season in other geographies around the world, which are still in their winter seasons. How that's going to actually happen in the Northern Hemisphere is still to be determined. I don't think anyone knows the answer to that and it has big variables on how society is effectively quarantining and masking as well. So -- but all factors that we're watching closely and that we're preparing for. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay. Well, thank you operator, and thanks everyone for the good discussion on today's call. While our results this quarter show the impact of COVID-19 on the entire health care industry, they also demonstrate our focus on execution and making an impact during a consequential time. I'm very proud of the way our team has rallied around our purpose of advancing the world of health to find impactful solutions to help the world respond to COVID-19 and I'm proud of the BD team for their continued focus on executing our long-term strategy, so we can emerge from this pandemic period strong and well positioned to drive growth. Thank you all for your time today.\nChris Reidy: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Speakers, please hold the line.",

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Monique and good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. If I had to summarize Q3 in two words, it would be execution and impact. I'm very proud of our team for the performance they delivered in the third quarter given the challenging environment. What stands out to me the most is the progress the BD team made executing and delivering on both our short and long-term agenda creating value for patients, customers, and shareholders. We launched the COVID-19 assay on Veritor, secured injection device orders for future vaccination campaigns, and scaled manufacturing to ensure continued supply of critical medical technologies across the continuum of care. We announced several U.S. government collaborations to expand U.S. capacity in critical to COVID product areas. We worked closely with our customers as they resumed medical procedures throughout the quarter. And we saw those procedures continue to increase as we exited the quarter. At the same time, the team never lost sight of the long-term advancing our growth strategy, driving our innovation pipeline, and executing on our cost savings and simplification initiatives. I'm confident the steps we're taking now will help BD emerge from the pandemic strong and put us in the best position for the long-term. Let's jump into the quarter on slide four. Our third quarter results reflect the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare around the world as we saw strong demand for COVID-19 related diagnostics and significant pressure on the parts of our portfolio that support elective procedures research routine care and lab testing. We anticipated we'd see the biggest negative impact from COVID-19 in Q3 and it's largely played out that way. All-in COVID-19 had a net negative topline impact of $600 million in Q3. Chris is going to provide more detail on performance during the quarter and our perspectives on recovery. But let me share a high level summary of what we're seeing starting with Interventional. Across the Interventional segment, we saw sequential improvement each month during the quarter as hospitals and patients started to resume elective and non-urgent procedures. In June, China delivered positive year-on-year growth in all three BDI businesses. We continue to watch China closely since they're further along in their post-COVID restart. We exited Q3 seeing BDI procedure volumes at approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels. Moving on to the Medical segment, we're really pleased with the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical Systems business which is growing high single digits on a year-to-date basis. We view both the pharma systems business and Diabetes Care businesses as more insulated and less impacted by COVID-19. As you know the rest of the segment's portfolio is closely tied to overall healthcare consumption, so naturally the impact of lower hospital utilization was very pronounced across the medical device consumables portfolio even more so than we had initially anticipated. That said we're encouraged that we saw demand for medical device consumables improve in June. Lastly, early demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity did spike in April as expected and then tapered down throughout the quarter. Now, looking closer at Life Sciences, as expected, we saw very strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and supplies during the quarter which was offset by a deferral of routine lab work as well as delays in capital investments on both the research and the diagnostic side. In Q4, we expect continued strong demand for our COVID-19 diagnostics solutions with the addition of the Veritor assay to the portfolio. In addition we did see reagent orders begin to pick up in June for both research and clinical applications which demonstrates that researchers continue to get back into the labs. While this remains a dynamic situation we're providing revenue and EPS guidance for Q4 and the total year as we have improved near-term visibility. Based on what we know today we believe our guidance range reflects the trends we saw in June and July and accounts for our expectations as we close out the year and Chris will go into more detail later on the call. Despite the challenging environments it's clear that BD's durable capabilities and critical health care portfolio have been and will continue to be a vital part of the COVID-19 solution. And I'm confident that the actions we've been taking position BD increasingly well to support our customers through the pandemic and return to growth as the global economy and health care industry continue to stabilize and recover. Turning to slide five, on our last call, we discussed how the strength and diversity of BD's portfolio enables us to support the world's response to COVID-19 across the full continuum of care. The BD team made significant progress executing this agenda during the quarter positioning us well to finish the year with momentum. So, let me share a few highlights with you starting on slide six. First, today marks one month since we launched the SARS-COVID-2 antigen assay for the Veritor Plus system, which received FDA, EUA in early July. We believe this platform is a real game changer, dramatically expanding access to COVID-19 testing at the point of care and reliably diagnosing SARS-COVID-2 in 15 minutes. In the first month since launch we received very strong demand for both the Veritor Plus system and the SARS-COVID-2 assay including from our traditional customers as well as nontraditional accounts. In our first month of launch we've shipped more Veritor Readers than we normally do in an entire year. This is a strong indicator of the unprecedented interest and demand for near real-time point-of-care COVID testing. As one example we're proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on their efforts to expand access to rapid point-of-care testing in nursing homes through their initial order of 2,000 Veritor Plus systems and 750,000 SARS-COVID-2 antigen test kits. To support the very strong demand we're seeing we are leveraging our world-class manufacturing scale and expertise to significantly increase supply capacity. And we're feeling good about both our original goal of producing 10 million tests in Q4 and our scale-up to our initial eight million tests per month run rate by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, last week we announced a $24 million investment from the U.S. Department of Defense in collaboration with HHS to support the additional scale-up of U.S. manufacturing, which is expected to bring global production of the Veritor assay to 12 million tests per month at the end of February 2021. We're putting the full capabilities of BD behind this including not just those in our Life Sciences segment, but we're pulling in talent from both BD Medical and Interventional to support the scale-up. Detecting and containing coronavirus globally will take a collaborative industry-wide response. And we're proud to partner with AdvaMed on the national diagnostic supply registry to help ensure widespread availability of testing. The Veritor assay joins a portfolio of three molecular solutions for our COVID-19 testing that BD has already delivered for use with the BD MAX molecular system that includes two with EUAs and two with CE Mark. We're now producing one million COVID-19 rapid molecular diagnostic tests each month for use on BD MAX. And as I've shared we're investing in further expanding BD MAX capacity so we can produce an additional 900,000 tests per month. The installation of these additional production lines is well underway and remains on track to be at our new 1.9 million BD MAX tests per month run rate by the end of the calendar year. Cumulatively we've produced more than 3.5 million rapid molecular tests for BD MAX. In addition to investing to expand capacity, we're also investing to expand our portfolio. Our R&D teams are actively advancing our work to develop flu plus COVID assays for both our Veritor and MAX platforms, so we can better support health care providers and patients. I'm very proud of the entire BD team for driving scale and impact through our COVID-19 diagnostics solutions. If we move on to slide 7. To date, we've now received orders for 470 million needles and syringes from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and other entities in anticipation of vaccine programs we expect late this year or early 2021. These orders represent a mix of safety and conventional device types. While we anticipate initial shipments to the U.K. in fiscal year 2020, the majority of these orders will be delivered in fiscal year 2021. In addition, we formed a strategic public-private, partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority known as BARDA. BARDA will invest an estimated $42 million into a $70 million capital project to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for injection devices. The new capacity is expected to be online within 12 months. And once completed BARDA will have priority access to injection devices from these new manufacturing lines to support mass vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and future potential pandemics. As the world's largest manufacturer of syringes and needles, we are focused on fulfilling routine customer demand such as for annual flu vaccination, programs while also ensuring we can support surge demand for pandemic response. We are continuing active discussions with governments around the world about the need to place injection device orders quickly to ensure timely delivery for 2021. As expected I also want to provide an update on Alaris. We are working diligently and with urgency to prepare the 510(k) filing. Our focus is on ensuring a comprehensive submission that will ultimately help enable timely FDA review and clearance. We expect to submit the updated 510(k) in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021 based on ongoing dialogue with the FDA. We recognize there's a focus on the time line for the 510(k) submission and that's important. But taking a step back, we feel really good about the overall collaborative process we are engaging in with the FDA. In our pre-submission conversations, the focus has been on having a complete and robust submission and we have been spending additional time on aligning the testing protocols upfront, which is time and effort well spent. We believe the more work we do upfront to ensure the most robust submission, the better we are enabling a timely review and clearance process. As expected, our team has completed quite a bit of the testing and other work required for the submission. And we have a much better visibility to our submission timing now than we did when we last updated in May. When it comes to human factor testing, we've completed 100% of our formative testing which is a significant milestone involving 12 different human factor tests in the middle of the pandemic. We are pleased with the data and outcomes. We have also completed a substantial software system verification. Completion of formative human factor testing and software verification retires significant risk to the submission. We are taking a bit longer to ensure full alignment with the FDA on the final phase of human factor testing which is referred to as a summative testing. And again we feel this investment in time now best serves us in meeting our ultimate goal of a timely 510(k) clearance. We have submitted our summative testing protocols to the FDA and expect feedback shortly. Concurrently we are continuing to recruit clinicians for the next phase of human factor testing. And once we have that feedback from the FDA, we will be able to complete the summative testing. In addition, in our ongoing feedback discussions with the FDA, we made the decision to include an update to our specialty EtCO2 module which is important for clinical care and especially COVID response. The EtCO2 module is used to help monitor patients on ventilators, while medication is being administered. We believe this is the right decision for the Alaris system over the long term the patients we serve and far outweighs the additional time line of a few weeks it takes to include it again providing the most comprehensive submission to the FDA to help enable a timely review and clearance. I can't emphasize enough, how seriously we take this matter. As with any project of this magnitude and complexity, there are always obstacles along the way. But we're confident that we have the right resources, the right plan and the right team in place. We'll continue to address any issues that may arise in a way that ensures the most comprehensive submission to achieve our ultimate goal of a timely clearance. This dedicated team is executing well. And we will keep you updated as we make further progress on key milestones. Moving on to slide 8, and our innovation agenda. Each of our segments are focused on driving consistent durable growth for the long-term. They are doing this through innovation in areas where we are our strongest, where we see disproportionate new growth opportunities and that are aligned with emerging health care and technology trends. During the quarter we launched four new products and we remain on track to deliver our robust innovation pipeline for the year as shown on this slide. Taking a closer look in BD Life Sciences. Let me call out a few milestones in our Biosciences business. This quarter we launched an upgrade to the BD FACSMelody to expand from two-way sorting to four-way sorting, enabling customers to capture more cell types. This capability is available as an upgrade to our existing installed base and helps to further strengthen our position in the fast growing entry level sorter market. During the quarter we also launched software version 1.1 for FACSDuet. This software enables the automated preparation of antibody reagent cocktails, which is traditionally a manual time consuming and error prone step in clinical flow cytometry workflows. This release enables our team to continue driving the successful launch of the FACSDuet base model, as well as extend into the larger leukemia lymphoma and mixed lab markets. In BD Medical, we continue to see good traction with BD PhaSeal Optima, a next-gen closed system drug transfer device we launched late in FY 2019. Our customers are increasingly choosing Optima to protect health care workers handling hazardous drugs, because of the product's safety, ease of use and demonstrated performance as the device minimizes residual drug loss in vials compared to other similar systems. Sales of Optima have grown sequentially throughout FY 2020 despite the challenging pandemic period and the launches helped drive high single-digit growth across our CSTD platform. I also want to comment on our pharm systems business, which is a great example of the diversity of BD's portfolio and how it's a real strength and strategic advantage. Pharm systems continues to perform very well, growing high single digits on a year-to-date basis. We continue to be positive about the outlook for this business. In addition to favorable market trends enabling strong growth in the prefilled syringes platform, we've also been investing in advancing our self-injection systems to meet the needs of our pharmaceutical customers. And lastly in BD Interventional, we recently received FDA clearance for our next-generation targeted temperature management system. The AS Stat Temperature Management System offers a way to noninvasively control temperature within a narrow range for all appropriate patients. We have now leveraged and integrated BD's capabilities around EMR integration and data analytics into the AS Stat system, which also incorporates advanced algorithms and capabilities to enhance the patient and the physician experience. In our Peripheral Intervention business, which is a global market leader in biopsy and implantable ports, we recently launched our first interventional oncology product Caterpillar. This novel technology is used for embolization of the arteries serving tumors. While commercializing new products during the pandemic has been challenging, the device has been used in more than 50 interventions to date with excellent feedback on its deliverability, visibility, under angiography and ability to cause rapid and sustained embolization of the artery. While still early, we believe the positive response from customers is a good indicator of the growth opportunity ahead. Before I pass it over to Chris, I want to briefly comment on slide 9 and the other drivers of our long-term growth strategy simplify and empower. As we discussed last quarter, we've been extremely focused on cash and expense management throughout this pandemic period. And this discipline was reflected in our SSG&A this quarter. In addition to helping to strengthen our bottom line, these efforts ensured we flow investments to the most significant opportunities. In addition, Project Recode remains on track. As you'll recall Project Recode is our comprehensive internal simplification initiative that we expect to deliver approximately $300 million in savings over the next four years. We're focused on operating the business with discipline including how we can best deploy resources to maximize our impact. And lastly in empower, in July, we released our FY 2019 sustainability report, sharing our latest progress against our 2020 sustainability goals and reinforcing that ESG remains a fundamental element of our strategy. We look forward to announcing our 2030 impact goals later this year. And as always you can find our quarterly sustainability updates in the appendix of today's presentation. All-in, I'm proud of the progress that our team is making. With the successful launch of Veritor and significant injection device orders from multiple governments, we are clearly delivering on our short-term COVID-19 response plan. We're making the necessary investments and are working as quickly as possible to fully resolve the Alaris matters to ensure the completeness of this complex system to aid the FDA's review and clearance. At the same time, we continue to execute against our strategy for long-term value creation. While we continue to navigate a challenging environment, I'm confident the steps we're taking now will put BD in the best position for the long term. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Good morning, Brian. Hey, Brian. This is Tom. Good morning. So as we mentioned earlier on the call, certainly demand is expected, as I think has been said by others, to exceed supply in the foreseeable future at least. And we certainly see that ourselves. Demand, as I mentioned before, is coming from many of our traditional customers, healthcare providers themselves. We've had quite strong demand there as well as non-traditional accounts. Nursing homes for us would have been a non-traditional account. We've seen announcements come out recently from states looking to acquire rapid antigen tests and the use in other settings. I think the value of near real-time 15-minute testing has gotten increasing traction. I'd say we've really seen the awareness of that increase over the last couple of weeks even more so. And that probably also coincides with increases in COVID rates across the country. So again, very, very strong demand, as I mentioned, both on the instrument side, which we've shipped already in the first month more than we normally would ship in a year. And our supply plans are on track to our ramp plans that we've shared before. But the demand is broad across both traditional and non-traditional segments. Hi, David. Okay. Dave, thanks for the question. So we -- as I mentioned before, we have completed quite a bit of the testing and other work required for the submission and we have a much better visibility to submission timing than we did and when we gave you update last, in May. I think from a human factor testing, we still have the other part of it. We did the -- we've completed 100% of our formative testing, which is the initial phase. Again, 12 different human factor tests, as I described, and we're pleased with the data and outcome. Now we've got to progress to that next stage, which is a broader set of testing. So that's still in front of us. A little bit of some of the other testing that we have completed. We've completed a retrospective risk assessment on the changes that have -- every change that's been made to the Alaris system since the initial 510(k). That work is almost complete. We see that as retiring significant risk to the submission. We've completed software verification based on the original scope, closing out most outstanding anomalies. Of course, that software is not going to be released until all of our integrated testing is complete. But this is -- that's a tremendous amount of work and a testament to the team being agilely working from home. I think the other area is, V&V and reliability testing. So we're pleased with our progress there, good progress made on both fronts, but we've -- we're at -- we've begun testing on selected components in certain types of tests. And we await feedback from the FDA on the overall set of protocols. And so, at this point, that testing is -- it's not necessarily that workstream on a critical path for the overall project, but it's still more testing that's in front of us. Just to give a little bit more color of the testing that remains. So, thanks for the question. We don't -- we remain very confident in the safety of the Alaris product. And as I said, we've been working very collaboratively with the FDA on advancing this submission. So, we feel good about that progress that we're making. And maybe I think, Chris that was very well said. I think Rick maybe the only thing I could add is, our -- we are running the company. Obviously we're managing it through COVID, but we are very much executing not only our short-term opportunities areas like Veritor and MAX and helping on the vaccination campaign around the world, but very much executing our long-term strategy. And so, as we think about for example our new product development pipeline and how we've been executing it, I've shared in the past, we've been really focused on continuing to improve our on-time delivery of products or on-time milestones. This year despite COVID we're going to improve. We're very much on track to improve our performance year-on-year again this year, even better than we had last year. Really proud of how the team is executing that. We just finished our strategic portfolio review. And we went through all the segments. And we're making those tough trade-offs, in terms of which programs give us the best returns and growth profiles going forward. And we're allocating and making sure those investments are continuing or adding in new opportunities that we see. And we're executing those pipelines on the Recode, as I mentioned. We've allocated resources to that this year. They're executing they're on track. And even in areas like our plant I continue to be astounded. In the middle of managing -- with our large manufacturing scale, you can imagine the complexity that COVID adds in. We watch our supplier base, a huge team that's just watching suppliers and any economic challenges they have. And how do we start preparing for backup suppliers to make sure there's no interruption in our supply chain. A lot of that is incremental, going on in COVID. And even during that, right our operations team is very focused on continuing to deliver, the routine CI savings. And they're again doing very well on that this year, incremental to the work that they're doing on COVID. And so, hopefully the takeaway from that is that, we are managing and navigating COVID with a high level of discipline, while at the same time, maintaining very much so our execution discipline on the long-term strategy. And MAX. Good morning, Robbie. Yes. And we've shared as we think about the fourth quarter right we assume the 10 million tests July through September at about $20 ASP per test, which is what we had shared in the -- historically. As you think about 2021, obviously it's going to depend upon -- the number one factor will be the intensity of the COVID pandemic and its duration timing of vaccine et cetera. And so I think the most that we can focus on is that we will --the 8 million tests per month by the end of September. And then we'll be ramping up production of more than -- right at 12 million tests per month at the end of February. Those are the numbers. The percent utilization of those is to be determined as things evolve. We want -- we don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on that at this point in time. Thanks, Robbie. So I would just say, as we've shared in the past, we always are evaluating and have historically. Tuck-in M&A has been a long part of BD's history in how we've grown many of the businesses that exist in the company from BDB to Vacutainer to of course --much of the Bard portfolio came in through tuck-in acquisitions and licensing inorganically. We continue to look at opportunities across all three of the segments and we're very focused on deals that we would look at. We're not -- as we've made very, very clear we have zero interest in any large transformational deals. We won't be doing those. We're looking at tuck-ins, which is traditionally what BD has done going back in time and has been critical to Bard. We prioritize very much and are looking at accretive deals. We're not looking at --we have zero interest in any significant dilution at all. So those are some of the key criteria I'd say we're looking at. Specific areas as I've shared before, we're not looking at areas far aside from our existing businesses. We're looking to leverage where we have strengths and competitive advantage and really rounding out those portfolios as we've done again in each of the three segments over time. And Chris anything to add? Thanks, Robbie. Good morning, Vijay. Yes. On antigen tests, I think, what's fair to say is that we've seen as I mentioned very strong demand right off the bat. I mean we're only -- we're literally at a month today. It's the anniversary. And we have very strong -- extremely strong demand on that product both on the Readers antigen tests themselves. I think what's very, very clear is there is a high need to know this person have COVID right now. And I don't want to wait a day I don't want to wait two days, three days, four days depending on how the system -- how effective the testing system is if you're sending samples out, you can get up to those durations. And I think there's a whole need where that just doesn't work that type of testing turnaround time and people -- high value on this getting an answer within 15 minutes. So that's -- and that ease of use there is unbeatable on the antigen testing approach. So right we're very focused on -- a we've been engaging a wide range of customers on that. As I mentioned, we've -- we're deploying not just the resources of life sciences, but of BD against that opportunity on the scale-up and making sure we have the right infrastructure to support the broader base of customers. Even logistically right shipping this volume out of product, and so again we're applying the full capabilities of the company behind this. So I think that's a fair approach to it. How that evolves again from a disease prevalence rate and consumption through 2021 no one knows the answer to that. But as long as it exists I would expect there's going to be a high need for antigen tests. Yes. On syringes as you said you heard us we gave a number on this call that was incremental to the number we gave last time right? So we have continued orders coming in not only in the U.S. but in other parts of the world. We think that's still relatively -- no change from what we had shared historically, right that we have capacity to add one billion units over the next -- we had always shared 12 months to 18 months. And we still see that opportunity side. I did call out right the devices that we are selling are a mix of safety devices and conventional devices. Safety devices have a bit higher ASP than conventional devices. So we'll see how that mix evolves over time. But overall, we're right in line. We're still on track to be able to produce that one billion units over the next 12 months to 18 months. And you can see right at over 450 million or -- well 470 million units right those orders are starting to come in quite steadily. I think that answer.. Thanks, Vijay. Good morning, Bob. So let me start with the last question then Chris can discuss the margins, which by the way we have shared. We're not sharing the specific margins of Veritor, but we have said that they're higher than the company average I think is the comment that we've shared in the past and probably what we're comfortable to continue to share, which is to your point. So on the long-term opportunity for COVID testing, I think again very difficult to predict at this point in time. I think, there's still a lot of uncertainties, even around the vaccine. Are you --is it going to be a permanent vaccine? Is it going to be a vaccine that you have to get every year more like the flu, I think those things will --if it's something like polio that gets eradicated because of a vaccine that you get a couple of shots of it upfront and then it's longer term that obviously will lead to a very different outcome than if it's something that you have to get annually. And if you forego that annual vaccination then now you're susceptible to get COVID. These things, I think are still being understood and will evolve. What I think we can say is that look we're placing a lot of Veritor instruments right now, and I shared that upfront in my commentary around demand just for the instruments in the first quarter. We certainly see point-of-care diagnostics as an area of focus of investment for the company and we have I think an example a clear indicator of that is we acquired a point-of-care molecular company earlier this year pre-COVID coming up. Because we saw the attractiveness of this space and we're continuing to invest in that area very heavily. I think the broader footprint of Veritors out in the marketplace, could you say regardless of how COVID evolves will that create a bigger opportunity for Veritor of consumption of --how long COVID will last is an unknown, but will they be using will there be more people out available to use flu strep other tests on Veritor? And will there be a societal continued shift to want to have testing results faster than they were before COVID happened. And I think those are all trends that I do think are going to be more permanent after COVID. Point of care is an area that, I would say, we are increasingly bullish on overall as a market. People understand now. Of course, people, a lot of people understand lab testing a lot more now than they did pre-COVID, because they have a lot more interest. And when you --understanding too when you have to wait days to get a result when you really need to know the answer, I think people also understand the value of that point-of-care technology. And so we do see that as a long-term trend and it's an area of continued investment. And we see some near-term opportunities that could continue to prevail for Veritor due the larger placement base. And then of course, we are continuing to invest in new technologies in that space as well. Hi, Amit. Good morning. Yeah. We --let me start with that. This is Tom, Amit. And actually we do have Simon on the phone as well. We have all of our segment presidents. And Simon, I'll ask you to comment on the oncology piece in a moment. I know that was one that we did see a little bit more impact in COVID than some of the other procedure areas as mammographies have been delayed. But just before we get to that, when it comes to actually more laboratory-based testing IVD testing that is one that we recognize that non-COVID diagnostic testing and specimen collection improved from about 75% in June to about 80% in July One of the indicators that, we look at very closely are the national reference lab volumes and I think it's fair to say that the information that they share in terms of overall underlying testing demand correlates very well with demand signals that we see in our Vacutainer business, which is of course a large business for us on the diagnostic testing side. Obviously, our IDS business gets a little bit more fluctuated because it is an infectious disease diagnostic testing. It's gotten both MAX and now going forward Veritor. And so we'll see more fluctuations there. But as we think about our PAS business very much we see the impact there correlated with what you would see in national reference labs. And the commentary that, they have around increased improvements from June to July match right with what we've seen as well. Simon maybe some further comments on the procedure side? Yes. I can't answer that. We don't know. At this point we are -- we've got visibility to supply the orders that we've received is a fair way to say it right? We don't as I mentioned that one billion units we've gotten 470 million units' worth of demand on that. And when I said the one billion units, right we mean that as truly incremental to just our ongoing demand remaining the same. And so that is another factor. Of course, we make way more than one billion units. We make billions of units a year of syringes on a global basis. And we're assuming all that base gets consumed normally. That includes a strong flu vaccination campaign that we would have syringes sufficient to provide that. And then this is incremental to that. And so right people will have to make choices. People could say I don't know if that's true that all those -- the base syringe consumption would remain normal that people wouldn't reallocate the syringes for other purposes in that. But there is a large base of other syringes that we're providing to the market as well. So what we can say right now is the current visibility of demand that's coming in from governments around the world is still within our supply capabilities. Good question. It's something we're obviously watching closely as well. Okay. Good question, Larry. So first-off, we had always shared that the original assumption was end of Q4 right? And obviously with -- that was pre-COVID pandemic and we indicated that that would have impacts on our ability to do the testing. And it has and we recognize that. As I shared we've completed quite a bit of the testing and we had shared that versus when we had given an update in May that we felt that we would have quite a bit of that testing done by now and that we'd have much better visibility in our submission time line and that is the case. And it's the basis upon which we've given the update today. As I answered I think it was David's question earlier on this topic I'd already walked through the testing that we've done on human factor testing as well as some of the other testing that's been completed.  In terms of incremental things, we have continued to have dialogue with the FDA and understand their feedback. So that's been part of the process. And that's been a really strong part of the process our collaboration with the FDA and it's something that we think is very important to get aligned on the testing. So that when again we submit the actual 510(k) that we're in a position to make it as comprehensive as possible so that the FDA is put in a position to be able to give us as timely of an approval hopefully as is possible that we do our best job in enabling that. The one thing that is added in -- and there may be others. But certainly one thing that I mentioned is the EtCO2 module which was in development before but we did make the decision that based on feedback from the FDA and where the technology ultimately came out in development that as we are working in parallel with our product development road map we made the decision to include that update in the 510(k) module. As I mentioned it monitors patients on ventilators while medication is being administered. And given the importance of having this in generation module in, we felt it was the best decision and the FDA agreed to include that in the filing. Just on the 483 itself that you brought up what I would say there is that resolving the 483 items, the 510(k) submission is not contingent upon that specifically. And so maybe what I can just make a couple of comments on that is that we have been separately from the 510(k) submission work we've been continuing our remediation efforts associated with that Form 483 that we mentioned on our last call. In addition to providing a comprehensive response to the FDA we've already begun taking actions. That includes initiating a voluntary field action at the end of June and another earlier this week that we announced. And so we're going to continue to take action including initiating program changes process improvements and field actions when necessary in a way that provides the best-in-class support to our customers and minimizes disruptions to patient care which is more important than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic. So, as I said before we continue to stand behind the safety of the product which continues to provide significant clinical benefits to patients and health care providers. And as I said before to be clear the timing of our 510(k) filing is not dependent on resolving every item in the 483. We are taking all appropriate actions to ensure that comprehensive 510(k) submission as we also work in parallel to resolve the 483 observations. Great. Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Josh. Richard this is Tom. Good question. As I had shared before, it is a broad sector of both traditional customers and customers who are new to us where this demand is coming from. And we also of course a lot of this given the -- of course our traditional customers we often are engaging with them directly. So think about hospitals and clinics and those types of locations. We are dealing with them directly and we see strong demand from those areas. We of course are also providing this product through most all the major distributors and they are mostly directly managing a broader nontraditional customer base who are approaching them or calling us and then we refer them through distributors. The ship-tos are much broader than we would ever be set up to manage directly and we typically sell Veritor through distributors anyway. But there it's -- as you saw I mean HHS announced acquiring for nursing homes. Normally that's a whole new customer segment. It's normally not doing Veritor point-of-care testing as an example. There are schools that in states that are buying them to test symptomatic kids when they're in the -- as they're thinking about starting up school. What if a kid says I've got X Y Z symptoms that mimic COVID what do you do? Do you send them home and wait a couple of days to get a test result? Or is it really important for you to know if that kid has COVID before they leave the building, so that you can determine what do you do with all the other kids and the teachers that were in that classroom with that child. These are the questions that the people are working through. We've had employers order the product for similar types of purposes in use of understanding, again if employees come up with symptoms et cetera while at work. How you triage and make decisions for the rest of the workforce that's there and helping keep the environment safe? So those are just a few of the examples that we see the testing. But hopefully, just gives a color that it is much more diverse base than would traditionally be doing flu or strep or our normal point-of-care test. Yes, Andrew, good question. On BTK, so we have nothing in our outlook in Q4 for BTK. I think we shared that in the past, but just to reiterate that. Of course, we have -- last we had shared is that we had submitted additional information as part of that PMA review and it continues to be under active review by the FDA. But we'll provide an update as we hear information from the FDA on that, but nothing to share at this point in time. In terms of the flu season, as I mentioned, we're making sure that first off that we have product to help support the flu vaccination campaigns this year. Obviously, we're also expect to continue to provide flu testing on the Veritor platform. And as I mentioned, we are -- we do have combination COVID-flu tests in development on both our MAX and our Veritor platform. And so those are -- we have teams actively working on both of those to support where we could have flu and COVID needing differential diagnosis as that season intensifies going forward. The other thing that we watch is -- and no one knows the answer to this. We have seen some evidence that the incidences of using PPE and social distancing and quarantine have reduced the rate of -- or the intensity of the flu season in other geographies around the world, which are still in their winter seasons. How that's going to actually happen in the Northern Hemisphere is still to be determined. I don't think anyone knows the answer to that and it has big variables on how society is effectively quarantining and masking as well. So -- but all factors that we're watching closely and that we're preparing for. Okay. Well, thank you operator, and thanks everyone for the good discussion on today's call. While our results this quarter show the impact of COVID-19 on the entire health care industry, they also demonstrate our focus on execution and making an impact during a consequential time. I'm very proud of the way our team has rallied around our purpose of advancing the world of health to find impactful solutions to help the world respond to COVID-19 and I'm proud of the BD team for their continued focus on executing our long-term strategy, so we can emerge from this pandemic period strong and well positioned to drive growth. Thank you all for your time today."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with some comments regarding BD's ongoing response to the COVID pandemic. First, I'm very proud of our organization as we have continued to adapt to the rapidly changing environment and evolving needs of our customers and associates. We have responded with both strength and agility to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our BD associates and to also best serve our customers and their patients as they battle the pandemic. Second, we continue to see strong demand for our COVID related solutions. This includes diagnostic test on our BD MAX platform where we are continuing to increase capacity to meet demand. We are also actively ramping our efforts around the recently launched rapid antigen test on BD Veritor point-of-care system. And we continue to grow our pipeline of orders for syringes and needles to support future global vaccination campaigns. Third, as we continue to adapt and meet our customer needs, we also remain focused on the execution of our long-term strategy, which positions us well for the future. In addition to the COVID related solutions, we launched four additional products in the quarter and we remain on track to execute against our new product pipeline for fiscal year 2020. We are also continuing our work on Project Recode as part of our plans to simplify BD, which will help drive future operating margin expansion. We are confident that BD will emerge from this global health crisis from a position of strength and will continue to create and deliver value to all stakeholders. With that context, let's move on to our results for the third quarter including a review of the COVID impacts. As Tom discussed our third quarter performance reflects the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues declined 9.4% on a currency neutral basis. This was driven by approximately $600 million in net COVID headwinds, which impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 1400 basis points. As we shared previously, we saw significant impacts to our results in April and May. We were pleased that the sequential improvement we saw from May to June across our businesses continued into July with Q3 being the trough in terms of negative impact of COVID to our businesses. I'll discuss more regarding the trends across our businesses later in my presentation. Third quarter operating margins were 20.1%. This reflects the impact of high decremental margins on lost revenues due to COVID-19 as well as COVID-related investments. Adjusted EPS was $2.20, which represents a decline of 28.6% year-over-year or 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Following our $3 billion equity issuance in May, we retired both the $1.9 billion term loan and the $695 million we had outstanding on the revolver. Our liquidity position remains strong with $2.9 billion of cash as of June 30. Prior to the equity offering, we plan to pay down approximately $1 billion in debt in fiscal 2020 and we remain on track to do that. Combined with the revolver pay down in May, we will have paid down a combined $1.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020. Moving forward, we believe it's more meaningful to talk about our leverage on a net basis with leverage being 3.1 times net of cash as of June 30. Moving to Slide 13. Before I discuss our revenue performance by segment, I'd like to provide some color on the COVID impact in the third quarter. As we expected, continued adherence to COVID-related stay-at-home measures resulted in a decline in elective procedures and lower hospital admissions and procedure volumes as well as fewer routine lab tests and related specimen collections. In addition, we saw reduced demand from research labs due to closures. There are also some delays in capital instrument installations as facilities and staff were not easily accessible due to COVID. During our third fiscal quarter, these headwinds resulted in a gross impact of approximately $800 million to revenues. In terms of recovery, we are pleased to see sequential monthly improvement from May to June across our businesses and in some cases like elective procedures, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. Gross headwinds in the quarter were partially offset by approximately $200 million in COVID-related tailwinds. This was driven by strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and infusion pumps. As we anticipated demand for Alaris infusion pumps under medical necessity was significantly higher in the month of April compared to May and June. Now turning to slide 14 in the medical segment. BD Medical revenues declined 6% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 600 basis points. In the Medication Delivery Solutions unit, our performance reflects the impacts of declines in hospital admissions due to COVID, which resulted in fewer procedures. The majority of our MDS portfolio catheters flush and the like tracked closely to hospital admission trends. If we look at the U.S., as an example, admission rates were down most significantly in April. We saw a sequential improvement over the quarter exiting with admissions at approximately 80% to 85% of pre-COVID admission levels. Lower procedure volumes drove reduced customer demand and resulted in distributors rebalancing inventories in May and June following distributor stocking that took place during March and into April in the U.S. and Europe. MDS performance also reflects distributor inventory reductions and lower volumes related to the ongoing volume-based procurement process in China, which were in line with our expectations. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we saw an improvement in the impact related to COVID in China as the quarter progressed. Revenues in the Medication Management Solutions unit reflects strong demand for infusion pumps in the U.S. under medical necessity and strong growth outside the U.S. particularly in Europe. Within the quarter the majority of the U.S. medical necessity demand occurred in April as expected. This strength was partially offset by delayed capital installations of dispensing systems due to COVID as anticipated. And similar to our MDS portfolio, lower hospital admissions also impacted sales of infusion sets in MMS. Pharmaceutical Systems performance reflects our continued ability to meet high demand for pre-fillable syringes. Pharm systems third quarter revenues also reflect some timing of customer orders within the year. Year-to-date pharm systems revenues grew a strong 8.1% and we expect continued momentum in the fourth quarter. Third quarter performance in our Diabetes Care business reflects distributor and retailer reductions to inventories as expected after inventory increases that occurred towards the end of the second quarter due to customer stocking related to the COVID pandemic. Now turning to slide 15 and the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues declined 7.8% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID-19 of approximately 1,700 basis points. In Diagnostic Systems, growth was primarily driven by strong demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testings on the BD MAX platform. This was partially offset by a decline in routine diagnostic testing due to COVID. Results in pre-analytical systems were impacted by fewer specimen collections due to lower routine diagnostic testing. And in the Biosciences units performance reflects slower research and clinical lab activity due to COVID-19 that led to reduced demand for instruments and reagents. Now turning to slide 16 in the BD Interventional segment. Revenues decreased 19.2% in the third quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 3,000 basis points. Revenues in both the Peripheral Intervention and Surgery units were impacted by the deferral of elective procedures due to COVID. Within Peripheral Intervention, the impact of COVID was most notable within oncology across the U.S., Europe and China, as women delayed mammographies and in our ESKD and PAD platforms in the U.S. and Europe. Sequential improvement was seen during the quarter across all platforms. Revenues in China were flat year-over-year as the declines in oncology were offset by solid performances in End-Stage Kidney Disease and PAD. Within the Surgery unit the impact was primarily related to hernia repair and infection prevention in the U.S. and Europe as well as biosurgery in the U.S. Third quarter performance in Urology and Critical Care reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the acute urology portfolio due to lower hospital admissions. We continue to see solid performance in our targeted temperature management and home care portfolios. As Tom mentioned, China delivered positive growth in the month of June in all three BDI businesses. We are continuing to watch China's recovery closely. For your reference, we have included a slide in the appendix of today's deck that provides our total company third quarter results by geography. I'll now turn to slide 17 and our gross profit and operating margins for the third quarter. Gross profit margin of 51.7% declined 340 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects the impact of decremental margins of approximately 80% on lost revenues due to COVID headwinds in the quarter. This was driven by the mix of impacted revenues as well as the high fixed cost nature of our business which resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing variances which were expensed in the quarter.  The COVID impact to gross margin also reflects investments, we made in PPE facilities and the like to ensure the health and safety of our associates. The COVID impact was partially offset by gross margin leverage of approximately 50 basis points driven by our ongoing synergy and continuous improvement initiatives. Currency had negative impact of 50 basis points on gross margins in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.1% declined 480 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects the COVID impact to gross margin as well as additional operating expenses and investments related to COVID. This includes increased shipping cost investment in areas such as IT to support associates working from home, as well as new product development including our BD Veritor rapid diagnostic test. The COVID impact to operating margin was partially offset by operating expense leverage of approximately 70 basis points that reflects our ongoing discipline and initiatives to reduce expenses particularly within G&A. I'll provide more details on that in just a moment. Higher deferred compensation expense due to strong stock market performance in the quarter also negatively impacted operating margin in the third quarter. As a reminder deferred compensation expenses recorded within SSG&A and is entirely offset in the P&L in the other income net line item. Currency had a negative impact of 50 basis points on operating margin in the quarter. As we look forward we continue to expect COVID pressure on gross margins to improve as revenues return. However in the immediate term looking to the fourth quarter we continue to anticipate decremental margins of approximately 80% on related to COVID headwinds. Turning to Slide 18 which recaps the third quarter income statement, as discussed revenues declined 9.4%, this includes a 10 basis point decline and pricing in the quarter which was slightly better than anticipated. Gross margin was 51.7% as I discussed a moment ago. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25.4% including the expenses related to deferred compensation. As a reminder this is fully offset in other income. SSG&A expenses were down 6.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis or 8.9% excluding the impact from deferred compensation. This decrease reflects our ongoing expense discipline and the proactive measures we took to mitigate the impact of COVID. Some of these items include compensation reductions at the management level and suspension of the company's 401(k) match, as well as hiring restrictions. The decrease in SSG&A, also reflects lower T&E expenses as the majority of our associates continue to work virtually. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in innovation to support our COVID response plan and our long-term growth strategy despite COVID-19 pressures. Our third quarter tax rate was 5%. This was driven by discrete items that occurred within the quarter that were contemplated in our prior guidance range. For the full year we continue to expect our tax rate will be between 14% and 16% with a high teens rate in the fourth quarter. Preferred dividends on our BDX B shares that were issued during the quarter were $9 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.20 as previously discussed. This includes an FX headwind of $0.11 in the quarter which was more than we anticipated. As expected the expiration of the Gore royalty impacted adjusted EPS growth by about 580 basis points. As a reminder, we will anniversary the expiration of the Gore royalty this month. As we look forward we continue to monitor several macroeconomic factors and the potential impacts to our businesses. First, countries states and even localities are in various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result there is still great uncertainty regarding future infection levels, recovery rates and resurgence as well as general health care utilization. Second a continued weak macroeconomic environment will likely keep pressure on the overall healthcare system, utilization and consumer spending. Third the pace at which deferred procedures return to normal continues to be one of the biggest variables. This will depend on several factors including disease condition and acuity. COVID-19 testing availability, reopening and resurgence in countries around the world, and state-by-state within the U.S. and patient willingness to seek care. It's difficult to predict how that will all play out over the long term. And finally the timing effectiveness and timeline for potential COVID-19 vaccines around the world and the impact of the vaccine on surveillance testing is all yet to be determined. Looking forward while we are encouraged by the sequential improvement, we expect to continue to see unfavorable impacts from COVID-19 in our Surgery and Peripheral Interventional business due to elective procedures and we cannot anticipate the pace at which those procedures will fully return to normal. Moving on to the acute and non-acute area where our MMS, MDS and UCC businesses participate. We are continuing to monitor hospital admissions and utilization levels for both COVID and non-COVID patient care, as well as care in the non-acute setting. As we have shared previously we do not expect demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity to continue at the same level going forward. In diagnostics, we are continuing to monitor COVID and non-COVID testing volumes globally. As I mentioned earlier we anticipate continued strong demand for our BD MAX diagnostic test for COVID-19. Also as we expected we have seen very strong demand in our rapid point-of-care antigen test on the BD Veritor platform and we are working to scale up manufacturing of both our Veritor Readers and assays. And lastly in our Biosciences business, the pace of recovery will continue to depend on levels of research activity and clinical testing and how quickly they scale up to normal operations and capital spending. Now moving on to Slide 20, before we move on to our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the trends we saw during the third quarter related to the impact of COVID across our businesses. We shared this slide with you on our May earnings call which at that time depicted our results for April. This slide has been updated to reflect the third quarter COVID impact. When comparing the Q3 slide to the month of April, you'll note several things and I'd like to speak to two of those. First the quarter shows an improvement versus the month of April as the recovery continues to progress. The other trend worth noting is in our MDS business where we saw a larger COVID impact in May versus April. We saw improvement sequentially in June from the May low point. In total the COVID impact to our MDS business was approximately $200 million. On average in the third quarter, our businesses were impacted by approximately 25% to 40% versus our pre-COVID expectations. We exited the quarter with the month of June approximately 20% to 25% below pre-COVID expectations or said another way June had recovered to 75% to 80% of pre-COVID expectations. We were encouraged to see that exiting the third quarter and into July COVID headwinds started to abate and tailwinds started to improve. Note that we saw a sequential improvement in recovery rates in July versus June. Recovery rates across elective procedures, hospital admissions and routine testing range from 80% to 85% versus our pre-COVID expectations in the month of July. We are also seeing strong early demand for our Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen testing and continued demand for COVID-19 test on BD MAX. As expected there was a small amount of demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity as well as continued delays in large capital installations. Turning to slide 22, despite the continued variability and uncertainty due to the pandemic, we are providing a view into our revenue and EPS expectations for the remainder of the year based on what we are seeing today. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down low-single-digits and adjusted EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.60. As a result, we expect a revenue decline of a negative 2% to a negative 1.5% and EPS of $9.80 to $10 for the full fiscal year 2020. As a reminder, our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 was a record quarter with over $730 million in sales in MMS, creating a very tough comparison. All in, we feel good about the remainder of the year based on the latest view of our business and assessment of macroeconomic environment. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to summarize the key messages from our presentation today. First, we continue to be uniquely positioned to respond to COVID-19 by leveraging our core capabilities across research, diagnosis and patient care. Despite a challenging and dynamic environment, our third quarter results reflect encouraging trends across our businesses in June. We have established a solid guidance range for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year as we have improved near-term visibility into our expected results. Based on what we know today, COVID-related headwinds appear to be abating and tailwinds are improving driven by high demand for BD Veritor. And lastly, we remain focused on executing on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver value to customers their patients and our shareholders around the world. Thanks, and I'd like to now open the call up for Q&A. Sure Brian. This is Chris and I'll start with that. And obviously normally on this call we get questions about the following year at this time of year and we hesitate to give any indications. This is probably even a tougher year to do that. We're giving guidance for the next two months, because we have a sense of the near-term visibility, but when you think about where things end up with hospital utilization and elective procedures of where does it top off, that's a tough one to call. Clearly we're seeing a good trend. We talked about that in our prepared remarks. June was better than May. July was better than June. So, that's a good indication. But where that tops out at, you see hospital utilization in that 80% to 85% range. Does it stay there? Does it get back to 100%? Those are the calls that you have to make. So that's a high variable and we'll be monitoring that obviously as we approach the November call. When you think about margins, clearly the decremental headwinds from COVID impact are strong 80%. And so, we're going to continue to see that with the -- into the fourth quarter. And then we'll have some lapping next year. But as that comes down, that headwind will lessen certainly over time. And then, on the more traditional stuff that we look at, FX right now looks like a push to slight tailwind. Resins, looks like it's a slight tailwind. We would expect to see some headwind in 2021 as we continue some of the COVID investments from this year and the full year impact of that. And on T&E, we are seeing some favorability from lower T&E. and we would expect that to carry over into the beginning of next year. And then we'll see with what kind of recovery, as people may be coming back from virtual work that might increase and have a little bit of pressure. Those are some of the things that you can start to think about, but it's a tough one to call this early. Thanks for the questions, Brian. Sure. So as we said, we are seeing those headwinds abate and you can see that trend through June and July. So we would expect that $600 million to come down significantly, but it's -- there still will be a headwind and so we have that and those headwinds do go down at the 80% level. So, I think, we've given you a lot of transparency into that. And so, that should help with the models. The biggest thing that I would point to in the fourth quarter that, I think, people have to remember, is the tough compare that we have particularly in MMS. And MMS had a record quarter at $738 million; as I mentioned in the prepared remarks last year, and that's a real tough grow over. And so, with that, the decremental margins being 80% on the COVID impact, that's significant. I think the other is that there are COVID operational investments that we have. Those will continue and drag into the quarter. And the other thing to remember about the fourth quarter is, generally, if you think about the Alaris ship hold, that's certainly impacting us again. The demand on the medical necessity, we're not expecting that to be what it was in the third quarter. So those are the kinds of things that we look at in the fourth quarter to get to the guidance that we gave. Sure. So thanks for the question, Kristen. We're looking at Q4 margins in the 54% to 55% kind of range. And when you're thinking beyond that, also remember that there's continued higher shipping costs as well. And you know what, we've been able to continue to drive leverage. In the charts that we gave on the third quarter, we broke it out where you could actually see the impact from the decremental margins from COVID. So we'll still have some of that, as we described earlier. We'll have some -- so that impact will lessen as the impact of COVID lessens in the fourth quarter. And that's why we get from that 51-ish percent kind of range up to the mid-54s. And in the mix as well, is the COVID investments that we have, as well as our ability to continue to drive underlying leverage through continuous improvement. So that gets you kind of to that 54% to 55% range. One other thing that I neglected to mention earlier in the question regarding Q4 is, also you saw the lumpiness of our tax rate. Those discrete items were anticipated for the year, but a lot of them fell into the third quarter. So as you're modeling the fourth quarter, you would expect to see a high-teens Q4 tax rate. And then, also keep in mind, the preferred shares and the dividend and that's what leads you to that $2.40 to $2.60 kind of EPS range. There's certainly is a lot going on. But yes, I think that's a reasonable jumping off point. So that's why we're trying to give you -- on that chart we're trying to break down the various contributors. So as the COVID impact abates you can -- that's a big driver at 80%. So as that goes away it starts coming. It starts improving. Again and again, we feel really good about the fact that we're able to on an underlying basis continue to drive improvements through, continuous improvements and synergies. And as we mentioned, Recode is a project that we will continue and think about that as a continuation of the simplification of the combinations of the companies that we've had over the number of years. Thank you, next question. Good morning, Rick. Sure. I'll take a start at that. And then, I'm sure Tom will chime in with his view. But you're absolutely right. 2021 is going to be a mixed bag. And the compare is very different. So as you think about 2022, as we think about it, we're still very much focused on the five plus on the top and the 10 plus on the bottom. And all of what you talked about in some of the growth drivers go towards, getting to that five plus on a sustainable basis. So we feel really good about the underlying business, the sustainability of that, mid-single digits kind of five plus kind of growth on the top. And things like Recode are designed to get us that kind of multiple to get you to the 10% on the bottom, on a sustainable basis. So we feel good about it getting back to that kind of level. And we feel good about the fact that where the business is on an underlying basis, performing extremely well in the face of all of the COVID impact that, we've had. And that is lessening. As we said, we see those headwinds abating. Now obviously that could change, with the change in the course of the pandemic. We're just calling that based on what we see today and so that does seem to be abating somewhat. And you've seen some of the tailwinds that have been increasing. But again, how much of that continues into 2022 will play out over time. And the only thing I would add from a slightly different perspective too is, given the level of uncertainty what you can count on us is a, high level of transparency. And I think -- I hope you'd agree that what we just gave on the third quarter and into July is very transparent. We've been very clear as to what we expect in the fourth quarter from Veritor for example. We'll go to great pains to break that out, so that as we navigate through that, it will be very clear, what's coming from Veritor. And what's coming from the base business. Sure. So nothing's really changed from a standpoint of our intent to delever the company. I think with the pandemic, as we've discussed right now, we're focused on cash. We're continuing to pay down deb. But at the same time, that net leverage, the gross leverage has been pushed off a little bit but we will continue to work that down over time. We feel good about the fact that the net leverage is where it's at. So that really hasn't changed. We'll see --we feel really well positioned in this time of uncertainty from a cash and liquidity standpoint. And as we've talked about that that gives us the firepower to invest in new products, invest in things like Veritor protection for example. And so it gives us the firepower to do that. It will continue to fuel M&A of tuck-in acquisitions et cetera. So we feel really good about the balance sheet. As we come out, as you think about 2022 for example, our overall capital allocation really hasn't changed. The good news is we do throw off a lot of cash and so we feel good about our dividend. We've had a long history of increasing the dividend. We've continued that through everything. I think you can expect that from us going forward as well. I look forward to the day when pandemics and the --this is sort of behind us and that strong cash generation leads us to a point where we can start buying back shares again. And we will come to that and get through this period. But the overall capital allocation really hasn't changed. So I'll start with --just to be very clear on the fourth quarter, we have talked about the 10 million tests and that is what is in our guidance is the 10 million tests. So we said that the demand for that is very strong. We feel good about our ability to produce that at that level. But that's what's in the guidance for the fourth quarter. And longer term I'll turn it to Tom. Yes. No nothing to add other than to emphasize that the key metrics there are strategic fit in our core businesses and non-dilutive accretive deals. We're not looking for a lot of dilution. And returns -- ROIC greater than the cost of capital in year four .Those are the kind of standard metrics we look at. But first and foremost a strategic fit. So let me take the first part of that. So just to make it clear I mean, we said that the $600 million in the last quarter we're modeling in the area of around $200 million net impact in Q4. And we do expect the tailwinds to go up with Veritor. We --Tom gave the number 10 times 20, so that's $200 million. We expect --I think we noted in the charts we expect BD MAX to be another $100 million as we -- impacts out there. And you would expect the Alaris to be --medical necessity to come down from third quarter to fourth quarter. So when you net all that out and with the abatement of the headwinds that we're seeing in elective procedures, hospital utilization going up a little bit still not back to normal but abating that's kind of where our thinking is. And the --I missed the last part of your question but I think it was Q4 share count. And you could use in your models about $293 million. Good morning, Bob. Sure. So let me start on the first part of your question was the COVID-related testing that we saw in Q3. That was $100 million on MAX. So think about $100 million on MAX and $100 million on the Alaris medical necessity or thereabouts. So that was the $200 million of tailwinds that we were talking give or take. On Q4, we've talked I think you can think about that $100 million going up to $300 million because the MAX is if we're running at full capacity and so we expect that to be about $100 million in Q4 and then you add in the Veritor of 10 million x 20. So that's $200 million gets you to the $300 million kind of thing. So moving on to the second part of your questions. I think again the revenue decline we're still seeing low single digits kind of a decline in the fourth quarter. I think the COVID impact particularly in the MDS business in Q3 was something that folks had been missing is very much driven by hospital utilization and you saw what that was. So we would expect that to continue because although utilization is getting better it's still under pressure. And so we do expect that revenue decline of low single-digits. Then you drop that at a decremental GP. I think on the last call, we were signaling kind of in the 75% range. It's really coming in closer to the 80% range. And again that's a testament to the fact that these are very high-margin products that are being impacted by COVID. And then in addition, we're doing the right things in terms of not building inventory during this period of time. And that's a very important point because as you're not building inventory, you've got absorption of variances that come in and hit the quarter. And we're taking that charge this quarter. We're not capitalizing it in inventory and carrying it forward. So that is a big part of what gets you up to the 80%. Obviously we're making COVID investments as well. And those investments range from what you would anticipate in terms of cleaning and those kinds of, things PPE those will continue. But in addition it would include all the work we're doing to scale the Veritor and the MAX. And so those are some investments we're making. I think the other thing that the -- would be new news compared to your models is the tax rate. And as we think about Q3 earnings the $2.20, we acknowledge the fact that that's -- is probably $0.20 of tax benefit there. But in addition compared to what we were expecting and what I think The Street was expecting the drag from FX was about twice what we would have thought at $0.11. So I think when you do that we're kind of in line with The Street for the third quarter. Then as you think about the fourth quarter though our range for the tax rate for the year isn't changing. So that just assumes a very high-teens tax rate in the fourth quarter. So I think when you plug that in and then you do the calculation for the preferred shares all of that kind of gets you into the range where we're at. Hopefully that helps. Good morning, Larry. And back to the first part of your question, I think it is fair to say, and we have said in the past that the margins here would be higher than the company margins. I think some of the numbers you're quoting seem a little rich to me particularly in the short term. This fourth quarter, I don't think you can expect us to ramp production and immediately get to those kind of margins in the fourth quarter. So I think some --the models that I've seen have just assumed we can get to those kind of margins day one. That's not practical, but clearly building over time to margins that are higher than the company average. Thanks. Hey, Amit. Good morning, Matt. Sure. So clearly, the -- where we saw that the most was access to facilities and installation. And that was certainly true in April and May. I think we commented that in June that we saw that getting better. And we certainly saw that to be the case in July as well. So it really has to do -- what we've seen thus far is really more access related than any lack of appetite for installations. We haven't seen any cancellations that were other than deferrals. And so we haven't seen that. Certainly that's something that is -- I talked about as our watch outs going forward. But at this stage, we haven't seen that manifest itself yet. It's really just about the installations at this point. Yes. Clearly, that's the case. And I think that's what's helped bridge a lot of hospitals from a cash flow standpoint. So I think those programs have certainly helped from that standpoint. So absolutely. Hey, Josh. Yes. So one thing I would mention and I think we mentioned it in our prepared remarks is that across BDI for example we were positive in June. And so we are watching China as we said very closely. And we are seeing some recovery there. Bear in mind that we also have in China in the medical area that you mentioned in the medical segment that we do have the impact of the volume-based procurement. So we did see -- I think also in our prepared remarks, we said that we continue to see some of that distributor stocking impact -- destocking impact as we go through that. Really no news on that volume-based procurement. That continues. It's a continuous thing. But outside of that, the recovery is happening in China and improving across the businesses. Yes. I'm not sure what you're referring to there because we're -- there is no normal run rate on medical necessity. That was something new. We did mention I think in the quarter in April, I think we might have noted how much that was. And I think we said, it was in the $70 million kind of range for medical necessity. And as I mentioned, the quarter was in the $100 million kind of range. And so obviously May and June were significantly lower than April. And I think -- and we're not expecting too much in the fourth quarter in terms of medical necessity. And obviously, that's a function of resurgence and everything else, but we're not anticipating anything significant there. Thanks everyone."

So certainly with oncology we did see an impact over the quarter, but month-by-month, we saw sequential growth as well. So it was slightly heavier impacted than some other parts of the PI business. But we also completed a survey. We actually surveyed 815 of our interventional customers of which 119 were involved in oncology. And most of our business as in oncology is either a implant or ports or biopsy and we've recently gone into interventional oncology. And what they're saying is that -- we've got interesting information that the patients that they've been treating are -- is a good mix between rescheduled cases and new cases. And these customers are also saying that their office volumes are beginning to rebound and they have a positive outlook as to what office volumes look like over the next 60 to 90 days. So while it was impacted the funnel was certainly impacted earlier on during COVID the outlook remains reasonably positive for oncology as well as other parts of the business too."

It will be available for replay through May 14, 2020, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by telephone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 2189907. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today\u2019s call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.\nMonique Dolecki: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. We hope that everyone is healthy and safe during these unprecedented times. With safety in mind, we are taking a more virtual approach today in exercising social distancing while conducting this call. Joining me in person, we have Tom Polen, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Joining by phone, we have Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment, Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. In particular, there\u2019s significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data we are providing today is based on our preliminary April sales results and the trends we are seeing in our businesses. We have made certain assumptions in how we are managing our business, but that could change as we move forward. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Our second quarter results include a $39 million non-cash charge to write down the carrying value of developed technology related to the planned retirement of the BD Accuri flow cytometer platform within our Biosciences business. In addition, we are working with the FDA with respect to certain features of our Alaris infusion pump products that are additive to our current remediation efforts. As a result, we have recorded a charge of approximately $200 million to reflect the estimated probable future costs relating to remediating Alaris\u2019 products. It is possible that this estimate could increase over time. Any remediation actions will continue to be guided by our proactive commitment to patient safety. In addition, due to challenges associated with the global COVID pandemic, among other factors, we no longer expect to submit our Alaris 510(k) filing in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with the FDA to assess how quickly we can get back to our previous plan and we will provide an update on our August earnings call. These items, along with details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedule is posted on the bd.com website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. I certainly hope you and your families are doing well as we navigate this unprecedented time. Our thoughts are particularly with those personally affected by COVID-19, including healthcare workers on the frontline who are caring for patients and battling this virus. As you\u2019ve seen in our press release, our second quarter results were ahead of our expectations even though the Q2 impact for COVID-19 was larger than we anticipated. While we\u2019ve seen strength in our portfolio that\u2019s more directly tied to COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we\u2019re also experiencing significant pressure in other areas such as products relied on elective procedures, research, and routine care. Chris will cover this in more detail later in the call. This remains a dynamic situation, and the timing and phasing of research and more elective healthcare returning is hard to predict. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to withdraw our guidance for FY 2020. As I\u2019ve shared in the past, you can expect transparency and straight talk, and so Chris will share with you what we know so far including what we saw in April, and he\u2019ll give you more color on the many factors impacting recovery. Before we get into the impact to our business, I want to spend time on BD\u2019s response to COVID-19, because I believe it embodies what we stand for and our purpose and what makes BD unique. And so on Slide 4, I\u2019d like to start by sharing my deepest thanks to the BD team around the world. I\u2019ve been with the company nearly 20 years and it never ceases to amaze me how our team rises to the occasion for our customers, especially during times of uncertainty. What I\u2019ve seen in the last two months is truly inspirational, and I\u2019m so proud to serve alongside this team. Turn to Slide 5. We defined four priorities that have guided our response to COVID-19 since January when we convened our crisis management team. First was to protect the health and safety of our employees. Second, maintain business continuity and mobilize our world-class operations to help combat the pandemic. Third, bring new solutions across the entire continuum of care from discovery and diagnosis to delivery of care. And fourth take proactive measures and continue to advance our strategy so that we ultimately can emerge from this pandemic strong and in a better position. And while we are actively working to address near-term pressures related to COVID-19, we will always operate our business for long-term value creation. I\u2019ll discuss each of these in more detail now. First, protecting the health and safety of our associates, on Slide 6. We took a number of actions very early on to help safeguard our team, including adapting the workplace for social distancing, increasing cleaning and disinfection protocols, and adding temperature monitoring at our manufacturing and distribution centers, beginning in February. We\u2019ve also increased personal protective equipment for employees, including leveraging our 3D printing and large scale molding capabilities to manufacture our own face shields so we can further protect our employees. Even as we made our own difficult decisions to furlough a small percentage of our manufacturing associates, we preserved full access to healthcare benefits for impacted associates in the U.S., including covering both the employer and the employee payroll reductions during the furlough period. Turning to Slide 7 and our second priority, mobilizing global operations. As you know, world-class manufacturing excellence is a core competency and focus for BD. All of our critical to COVID manufacturing and distribution centers are operating at or near full capacity. You can imagine that\u2019s not easy in this environment. We have BD associates stepping up around the world to make this happen. Just one example is we\u2019ve had more than 100 of our manufacturing associates from Malaysia volunteer to temporarily relocate to live in Singapore during the border closure. They moved away from their families to Singapore in the middle of the pandemic just to help maintain operations at our Singapore plant. Two thirds of all BD associates or more than 43,000 of our workforce who work in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and field service roles have continued to come into BD or to customer sites nearly every day during this crisis to help ensure our products and solutions are there when patients need us most. And I thank each and every one of them for that. We\u2019ve leveraged our scale and ramp production to the highest degree possible in this environment, and three examples stand out to me. First is to reduce the risk of exposure to caregivers. Some clinicians move the Alaris system from the bedside to outside the patient room dramatically increasing demand for IV extension sets. BD team responded with urgency, increasing production of these sets 100-fold within just a month. We\u2019ve dramatically increased the number and types of specimen collection swabs from about 500,000 each week in February to an expected 3 million in June \u2013 3 million a week in June. We\u2019ve significantly scaled production of our BD MAX reagents used for open-assay tests including our new molecular assay for COVID-19. We have increased output of open-assay kits by more than 80-fold between February and June and we\u2019re currently manufacturing six times more each month than we did all of last year and we continue to scale that up. We\u2019re also looking ahead recognizing a potential second wave of COVID-19 which could align timing wise with flu season. We\u2019re preparing additional capacity to ensure we can address both demand for a flu test and an antigen COVID-19 assay. Given that the symptoms are pretty similar, we\u2019re also anticipating potential higher demand this fall as well. I also want to reassure you that we\u2019ve ramped production as we\u2019ve ramped production our commitment and focus to delivering the highest quality products has remained extremely unfocused. While we\u2019re experiencing historically high demand for critical to COVID products, there\u2019s also negative pressure on product categories tied to routine health care visits and lab testing, elective procedures, and non-COVID research. For example, during Q2, we began to see a significant decline in elective procedures. During the end of the second quarter, demand for research reagents and instruments slowed dramatically as research institutions and labs temporarily closed due to lockdown. As a result, we have temporarily slowed or suspended production at a few of our non-COVID related manufacturing sites to preserve liquidity. We\u2019re in frequent contact with our customers and we\u2019re closely monitoring demand signals and we\u2019re ready to start immediately \u2013 resumed production immediately as soon as those procedures and research restarts. Our ability to adapt and mobilize our global operations to respond to the pandemic is a testament to our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities, the dedication of our employees and the strength of our public-private partnerships. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve regularly engaged federal, state and local government officials around the world to help safeguard operations and minimize the risk of supply chain disruption. It\u2019s clear the strength of our global operations network is a significant advantage for BD and the healthcare providers who rely on us.  Turning to Slide 8, another advantage unique to BD is the strength and diversity of our portfolio, which I believe, as I\u2019ve said in the past, is unmatched in our industry. We\u2019re leveraging our expertise and capabilities to deliver solutions across the continuum from research to understand immune response to diagnosis and surveillance, to medication management, delivery and critical care, and ultimately to prevention as we look ahead to a potential vaccination campaign. First, in order to treat a disease, you have to better understand it. And that\u2019s why scientific research on COVID-19 continues to move forward even as many labs and institutions pause or postpone other important studies. And our Biosciences business has been helping researchers better understand how the immune system responds to COVID-19 and why some people are more effected and others show only mild or no symptoms. And we believe this scientific research is key to better understanding and ultimately battling COVID-19. Turning to Slide 9. We\u2019ve launched a full portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostic solutions which help healthcare providers answer two basic questions, who has it and who had it? And so as you think about who has COVID-19, we\u2019ve leveraged our strength in molecular diagnostics to bring the market three molecular tests, two as a CE mark and two that have received EUA approval from the FDA in the U.S. These tests are designed exclusively for the BD MAX system, which has already in use at over 1,000 laboratories worldwide. The tests are conducted on onsite, mostly at hospital labs, and increased time to result to just two to three hours of up to 24 samples at a time. We\u2019ve now shipped test kits to more than 500 hospitals around the world and moving forward we\u2019re able to provide approximately 250,000 tests per week or about 1 million a month. We\u2019re also hard at work developing a forced [ph] diagnostic point-of-care antigen test that leverages our Veritor platform targeted to diagnose COVID-19 in less than 15 minutes. There\u2019s broad interest in this test and with nearly 30,000 Veritor devices already in mostly non-acute care centers across the U.S. We expect this could be a real game changer for testing capacity and helping and restoring the economy. This test is still under development and we\u2019re evaluating performance with samples now. Pending that outcome, we would submit for EUA authorization and we\u2019ll keep you updated as this progresses. To test for who had COVID-19, we\u2019ve partnered with BioMedomics to market a serology test that can detect antibodies in blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19 in as little as 15 minutes. In fact, the published data in the Journal of Medical Virology was one of the world\u2019s first for COVID-19 serology test. Given the latest guidelines from the FDA on performance characteristics for EUA approval of serology tests, we\u2019re currently validating performance of a second generation enhanced version of this kit which is produced and we are testing moving forward with that testing now. We are proud of the portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics. We\u2019ve built and launched in record time to help address this urgent public health need. Turn to Slide 10. And our solutions for treatment and care. BD\u2019s global scale is nearly unparalleled enabling patient care in almost every country around the world. In fact, about 90% of patients that enter an acute care setting are touched by a BD product. Although overall hospital utilization is down due to COVID-19, countries and healthcare providers have been preparing for the worst, setting up surge field hospitals and expanding ICU beds. BD teams around the world answered the call working to help set up these facilities and ensure access to critical to COVID medical technologies. For an example, we recently saw increased demand for our Pyxis rapid emergency deployment offering where we can deploy and install Pyxis med stations in about a week to help set up temporary field hospitals like we did at the McCormick center in Chicago. We\u2019ve also seen high demand for our portfolio of vascular access devices, infusion sets and injection devices which are critical to safe and effective medication delivery. Hospitals have also turned to our targeted temperature management devices to help in the care of symptomatic COVID-19 patients and we\u2019ve seen strong demand for our acute dialysis catheters as one of the complications of serious COVID-19 is a multiple organ failure including acute kidney injury. I also want to comment on infusion pumps, which as you know are critical devices in acute care and especially the ICU as each patient on a ventilator is often connected to multiple infusion systems. Outside of the U.S., we have more than tripled manufacturing and customer shipments of our infusion pumps for EMEA in response to COVID-19. We\u2019ve accelerated the distribution agreement that will expand BD\u2019s offering an infusion and help address rising demand for infusion pumps in select countries throughout Europe. And I\u2019ll speak to this in further detail later on. In the U.S., we\u2019ve established a process for existing customers at the BD Alaris system to receive additional Alaris pumps upon certification of medical necessity. Our team is continuing to work diligently and with urgency to prepare the comprehensive five, 10-K filing we discussed in February. And while our team has been driving to submit that filing in the fourth quarter due to challenges associated with the global pandemic among other factors, we anticipate extending our initial timing for submission until after Q4. We don\u2019t have a more precise timing at this point and we\u2019re actively continuing to collaborate closely with the FDA to ensure we meet their expectations. I want to ensure you that we are committed to getting this done and done right. It\u2019s our top priority and we\u2019ve added significant dedicated resources. We\u2019re making significant incremental investments and we\u2019re rotating in top talent from across BD to drive this program to completion. My executive team is directly on this on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that we are best positioned to work through any potential obstacles that might challenge our progress. And as I said, this is the critical priority for the company. In connection to the charge that Monique described, we\u2019re working with the FDA following their onsite inspection of our MMS facility in San Diego during the quarter. The FDA made a number of observations in a Form 83 notice we received an April and why we were early in the process. We were already beginning to implement certain corrective actions to address the observations. We\u2019re also taking this seriously and we\u2019re working collaboratively with the FDA and making necessary investments and keeping our focus on quality and doing what\u2019s right for our customers and patients. We\u2019re going to continue to keep you posted on our progress here. Finally, looking ahead to the development of a potential vaccine, we\u2019re an active and ongoing discussions with multiple countries around the world to provide the maximum support possible for the world\u2019s response to COVID-19 including production of syringes for potential large scale vaccination campaign. As the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of needles and syringes, we have already ramped up production of injection devices in anticipation of a surgeon demand for these products. It\u2019s important to acknowledge, of course, that BD is not immune to the financial impacts of the coronavirus, which we certainly saw in China this quarter. And while our underlying pre-COVID business remains strong as evidenced by our solid Q2 results. We expect to continue to see significant pressure on certain businesses as we move forward. And on Slide 11, I want to give you a better sense of these headwinds and the uncertainties around the pace of recovery, which Chris is going to explain in more detail. So elective and non-urgent procedures are down significantly, which is having a direct impact on our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention portfolio. There\u2019s a wide range here with elective procedures for oncology and end-stage renal disease being least impacted and our hernia and peripheral arterial disease and biosurgery businesses being the most impacted. As some states begin to allow elective procedures to resume this month, there\u2019s clear interest and willingness by hospitals and physicians to restart elective procedures in a controlled and phased way. A survey of our top accounts that we\u2019ve done indicates that 80% of our customers want to begin resuming these elective procedures by some degree by early June. While our customers clearly want to restart procedures, there are some questions of patient\u2019s readiness to return and we\u2019re monitoring that closely as well. We certainly have to date has seen sentiment among patients mix, particularly for procedures that fall in the mid-range of procedure prioritization. Secondly, with non-COVID hospitalization down, we\u2019re monitoring the impact of our business both in terms of products used in inpatient care as well as to capital budget. Since China and several other countries are a few months ahead of the U.S., we\u2019re closely monitoring their recovery and utilization to see what we can expect as we look forward. In diagnostics, we\u2019re seeing strong demand for our comprehensive portfolio of COVID-19 offerings, however, the deferral of routine care as you know is having a significant negative impact on diagnostic testing overall, which of course leads to temporarily lower use of sample collection devices. Again, we\u2019re closely watching China here to see what we can learn about the pace of recovery for routine tests and sample collection. And in research where temporary lab closers have had an immediate and significant impact on demand for our Biosciences reagents and research instruments. We expect recovery is going to take some time. We\u2019re paying attention to when researchers going to be able to head back to work and how long it\u2019s going to take for lab testing and experiments to restart. In anticipation of the pressures, we\u2019re now seeing in our business. We\u2019ve been very prudent and proactive taking swift action to reduce costs and reinforce our strong liquidity position. And Chris is going to speak in greater detail to those in just a few moments. At the same time, we\u2019re taking proactive measures. We\u2019re also continuing to advance our long-term growth strategy and prepare for our next phase of value creation. In each of our segments, we\u2019re deeply focused on executing our strategies to grow, simplify and empower as shown on Slide 12. We\u2019re always going to drive growth through category innovation and we\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas when it comes to R&D. Across each of our segments, we have a strong portfolio with a robust innovation pipeline that\u2019s weighted towards solutions for faster growing markets.  During the quarter, we continued our strong cadence of delivering our R&D pipeline, introducing nine new products in the quarter. Let me share a few highlights of our strategic progress to demonstrate why I\u2019m confident we\u2019re seizing the right opportunities to emerge from this pandemic strong. In medical, I mentioned earlier we had accelerated the distribution agreement with Medcaptain Medical Technology Company, who developed in CE marked and innovative new infusion pump platform that\u2019s tailored for the European market and we\u2019re very pleased with the first steps in this collaboration and it\u2019s enabling us to help advance our medication management presence in the region as well as our global expansion strategy. In interventional, we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy and advanced solutions for faster growing markets. During the quarter, we released both the 300 millimeter and AV low-profile Lutonix balloon. Supported by these launches, we continue to see sequential improvement in the use of drug coated balloons prior to COVID. We were also early in our launch of Dry Dock 2.0 which is a technology designed to enable the continued use of the PureWick female incontinent device in the post acute and in the home. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Straub Medical, which is a privately held company focused on devices that treat or restore blood flow to clotted or blocked vessels. This acquisition further expands our portfolio with a proven device with \u2013 it\u2019s approved with dual indications for arterial atherectomy and thrombectomy in the U.S. It has solid existing sales in Europe and China. We\u2019d be leveraging our strong existing channel and expertise in endovascular technology as we bring this product to the U.S. and accelerate existing sales around the world.  Finally, within BDI last week, we completed the submission of additional data for Lutonix BTK filing. This is now continuing FDA review. Turning to Life Sciences. This quarter we launched the FACSymphony S6 system, our new cell sorter with six-way sorting and up to 60 panels of detection. The S6 enables an end-to-end solution for high parameter cellular analysis and reinforces our commitment to research solutions. We also launched the BD Kiestra ReadA instrument in Europe and we submitted the five, 10-K filing with the FDA this quarter. Continuing to execute on our strategy of modular laboratory automation solutions, the BD ReadA system \u2013 the BD Kiestra ReadA system transforms the manual hands-on workflow of plate reading into a fully automated and digital process that enhances lab efficiency and reduces time to result. I also want to give you an update on our launch of the BD core system in Europe, which as you\u2019ll recall, is a fully automated molecular platform for high volume labs. When we announced this new innovation last quarter, we were still very early in the launch. The BD core continues to exceed our expectations and installations move forward even in light of COVID-19, I think reinforcing the customer interest in this platform. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NAT Diagnostics, an early stage company with a very innovative platform in the fast growing molecular point of care market. This acquisition will ultimately extend the breadth of BD solution offerings into molecular point of care testing. We are advancing this new molecular point-of-care platform in development and we\u2019ll keep you updated as this system advances closer towards launch in the next few years. I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019re making and the three agreements we\u2019ve completed, the Straub Medical, NAT Diagnostics, and Medcaptain, which are evident that we continue to invest in growth in all three segments even during this pandemic. And while we\u2019re navigating real near-term pressures, I\u2019m confident the steps we\u2019re taking now will put BD in the best position for the long term. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Reidy: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to begin my comments by addressing BD\u2019s response for the COVID-19 pandemic. First, as the coronavirus emerged, I was very proud to see the response and collaboration across our team and the immediate focus on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our BD associates around the world. Also vital to our crisis response was our focus on taking care of our customers and the communities we serve. Beyond the actions we took at a company level, I\u2019ve been truly amazed by the reaction from our associates, from our frontline to our back office staff and everywhere in between our associates that put the wellbeing of our customers and our communities above their own personal priorities. Second, from a cash perspective, we took early and prudent actions to protect our business during the time when liquidity is paramount. And lastly, as we contemplated these actions, we did so with the continued focus on our long-term strategy. We\u2019re confident that BD will emerge from this global health crisis from a position of strength and will continue to create and deliver value to all stakeholders. With that context, let\u2019s move on to our results for the second quarter, including a review of the COVID-19 impacts. As Tom mentioned earlier, performance in the second quarter was ahead of our prior expectations. Revenues grew 2.4% on a currency neutral basis, despite a larger than anticipated impact from COVID. As you\u2019re well aware, the virus worsened significantly in China during February and subsequently spread beyond China\u2019s borders quickly becoming a global pandemic by mid-March. I\u2019ll provide more color on second quarter revenue growth and the impact from COVID in a moment when I take you through the results by segment. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.55, which represents a decline of 1.5% year-over-year or 1.9% on a currency neutral basis. EPS performance was above the high end of our guidance range due to revenue over performance and lower operating expenses as well as a small benefit related to foreign currency. As expected, the expiration of the Gore royalty impacted adjusted EPS growth by about 600 basis points. Operating margin of 24.7%, we\u2019re also ahead of our expectations for the quarter, largely driven by lower deferred compensation expense due to weak stock market performance in the quarter and lower operating expenses.  Turning to Slide 16, I\u2019ll provide an update on cash and liquidity and the early improvement actions we took during the quarter to reinforce our strong liquidity position. In March, we successfully completed $1.9 billion of term loan funding at very favorable rates. This resulted in an increase in our gross leverage to 3.9 times at March 31. During the second quarter, we also increased capacity available under our revolver by $381 million to $2.63 billion to further strengthen our liquidity position. It\u2019s also important to note that we remain committed to achieving our below three times gross leverage target, continuing to delever remains a very important commitment to the company and we currently plan to pay down approximately $1 billion in debt in FY 2020. However, due to the near-term anticipated pressure on EBITDA and given our current focus on cash conservation and the importance of liquidity, we now expect it will take longer to reach out deleverage target. In addition to our treasury related actions, we have instituted a number of cash conservation measures. This includes lowering capital expenditures as well as working capital initiatives with a focus on inventory management. From an operation standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, our employees are going above and beyond to serve our customers in their patients and this includes keeping our plants operational. Manufacturing teams are ramping up much needed products and we\u2019re making additional investments as a result of the increased demand we are seeing in some of our businesses due to COVID-19. In other areas where scaling back and have made the difficult decision to temporarily furlough some employees as we manage inventories and adjust in near-term demand levels. In addition to the temporary furloughs, we felt it was important and consistent with our values to share the impact across our global team. So we\u2019ve taken actions more broadly across the company to reduce salaries at the management and Board levels and also for senior leaders. The executive team and Board took the largest percent reduction. The decision was also made to suspend the company match for the 401(k) and other benefit plans for the remainder of the calendar year and to limit hiring to critical positions. While difficult, the actions we are taking today will reinforce our financial strength as we emerge on the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Now moving on to Slide 17, before I discuss our revenue performance by segment, I\u2019d like to take you through the COVID impact in the quarter. All in, we estimate that COVID reduced revenue growth by approximately 140 basis points in the second quarter. This is about double the impact we had estimated at the time of our last earnings call, which was prior to the escalation of the virus in China and the global spread of COVID during the last two weeks of March. As you would expect, the majority of the COVID headwind in the second quarter was in China. This was driven by strict adherence to stay at home measures which resulted in lower hospital utilization and a decline in elective procedures as well as fewer routine lab tests and related specimen collections. In addition, there was reduced demand from research labs due to closures amid the stay-at-home measures. Within the U.S. and Europe, there was a net tailwind from COVID in the second quarter. This was driven by increased demand for critical healthcare devices during the pandemic. We also saw the initial use of BD MAX for COVID testing. While demand increased in the acute care setting, this was partially offset by a decline in the non-acute area as people generally stopped seeking care outside of treatment related to the virus.  Turning to Slide 18 and the Medical segment, BD Medical revenues in the second quarter declined slightly compared to the prior year, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 40 basis points, but then the medication delivery solutions unit as anticipated, our performance reflects distributor inventory reductions related to the ongoing volume-based procurement process in China which were in line with our expectations. Outside of China, we saw strong growth in our vascular access management portfolio of solutions. With respect to COVID, the most notable headwind in the quarter was in China and was driven by significant declines in hospital utilization. In the U.S., COVID was a net tailwind that was driven by surge demand and distributor stocking partially offset by the impacts from lower routine and elective procedures and acute care and lower utilization in the non-acute setting. We also experienced COVID-driven surge demand in Europe in the second quarter. Revenues in the medication management solutions unit reflect limited installations of Alaris pumps as anticipated. Within the quarter, Alaris sales on the medical necessity approval were approximately $10 million. Alaris pending order volume on the medical necessity was high at the end of March. However, these orders were not filled before the quarter end. As a result, the revenues associated with those orders were recorded in April. We currently anticipate demand for Alaris pumps on the medical necessity will continue in the third quarter as hospitals respond to the COVID situation, albeit to a lesser extent than April as we expect demand to follow the evolution of the virus curve. In Pharmaceutical Systems, growth of over 11% reflects our continued ability to meet high demand for prefilled syringes and it was also aided by the timing of shipments. Within our diabetes care business, we saw an increase in sales of insulin pen needles and syringes as distributors and retailers increase their inventories on hand as a result of the COVID pandemic. Diabetes Care performance also reflects a tough comparison. The timing of what is that drove a strong Q2 last year. Turning to Slide 19 in the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues increased 7.1% in the second quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 120 basis points. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostic systems and pre-analytical systems units. Growth in diagnostic systems was driven primarily by a point-of-care BD Veritor flu assay and our swab collection and transport systems. This was due to a stronger flu season in comparison to the prior year and was aided in March by COVID-19. We also continue to see strong growth of our BD MAX instruments and assays for routine testing as well as an increased demand globally for using COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by a decline in routine testing and our microbiology and women\u2019s health and cancer products due to the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in China. Performance and pre-analytical systems reflect solid growth in wingsets in develop markets as well as favorable comparison due to distributor ordering patterns in the prior year. Within Europe, we saw some stocking of specimen collection devices related to COVID. This was partially offset by a decline in routine specimen collections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in China. Performance in the Biosciences unit reflects a tough comparison to the prior year, driven by the timing of licensing revenues and tenders in emerging markets. Results in the Biosciences unit also reflect reduced demand for instruments and reagents as research lab activity slowed significantly through the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as well as in China. Turning to Slide 20 and the BD Interventional segment, revenues increased 3.3% in the second quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 350 basis points. Excluding the impact of COVID on elective procedures, revenue growth and peripheral intervention was broad-based, including continued strong performance in our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products. Additionally, there was an improvement in the year-over-year decline in DCB related revenues driven by continued commercialization of DCBs in Japan and sales related to two new product launches in the U.S. Within PI, the decline in elective procedures in China resulted in reduced demand across our portfolio. Revenues in the surgery unit were broadly impacted by the global slowdown in elective procedures due to COVID, particularly related to hernia repair across the U.S., Europe and China as well as biosurgery in China. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, growth was strong in both hernia and infection prevention. Revenue growth in urology and critical care continue to be driven by performance and targeted temperature management, home care and PureWick. I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 21 in our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter. As you\u2019ve already heard from some of our peers in MedTech, COVID will put pressures on margins in the near-term given the high fixed cost nature of our business. In addition, we\u2019ll see an impact from the lost revenues carrying your gross margin rate that is higher than the company average. We expect this pressure on margins to improve as the revenues return. In this quarter, gross profit margin of 54.7%, declined 110 basis points on a performance basis. We had anticipated a year-over-year decline in gross margins due to the impact from lower Alaris sales and volume based procurement in China, particularly partially offset by our continuous improvement and synergy and initiatives. Due to a larger than anticipated impact to revenues from COVID and the related impact to mix, gross margin came in slightly below our expectations. Currency had a positive impact of 50 basis points on gross margin in the quarter. Operating margin of 24.7%, increased 110 basis points in the quarter or 70 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This was driven by lower deferred compensation expense recorded with an SSG&A that is offset in the P&L and the other income net line item. Excluding the 110 basis point benefit from deferred compensation, operating margins decreased 40 basis points currency neutral. Unfavorable gross margin performance was partially offset by lower ongoing initiatives to reduce expenses, particularly within G&A. Currency had a positive impact of 40 basis points in operating margin in the quarter. Now turning to Slide 22 which recaps the second quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 2.4%. This includes 10 basis points of positive pricing in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect pricing to decline approximately 40 basis points versus our previous estimate of 50 basis points to 60 basis points. Gross margin was 54.7% as I discussed a moment ago. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.2% including the benefit from deferred compensation. On an underlying basis, excluding deferred comp SSG&A expenses grew at a rate below sales and reflect our ongoing focus on discipline spending and the achievement of Bard cost synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.8% as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth, despite COVID-19 pressures. Our tax rate was 16% in the quarter in line with our expectations and our full year guidance range of 14% to 16%. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter and as a reminder, the preferred shares converted on May 1. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.55 as previously discussed. In these uncertain times, we believe it\u2019s critical to maintain our unwavering commitment to transparency and to share with all of our stakeholders the anticipated financial effects of COVID-19 on our business to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, despite having April results, as we navigate these unprecedented times, there are still too many variables to guide the fiscal year or even the third quarter. As we look forward, we are considering the following macroeconomic factors. First we\u2019re in the early stages of recovery and there\u2019s still great uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the pandemic. Key to the recovery and the impact to BD is the return of general healthcare utilization. While we have begun to see some improvement in China as they are earlier in the recovery phase, the U.S. and Europe are lagging and this can be seen in our April results, which I\u2019ll speak to in just a moment. Second, we are clearly operating in a much weaker macroeconomic environment and as you know, a weaker environment generally puts pressure on the overall healthcare system utilization and consumer spending. And finally, the pace at which deferred procedures return to normal is the biggest variable. This will depend on several factors including disease condition and acuity, COVID-19 testing availability, reopening of countries around the world and state by state within the U.S. and patient willingness to seek care. It\u2019s too early to call how that will all play out. And that brings me to the bottom of this slide. As we move forward, we expect to see the biggest unfavorable impact of COVID-19 in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses because surgeries or other procedures in which our products are used are being deferred. We cannot anticipate the pace at which those procedures will return and how our customers will manage pent-up demand. Moving on to the acute and non-acute area where our MMS, MDS and UCC businesses participate. We see some pluses and minuses. We expect these dynamics to shift going forward and I\u2019ll provide more details on the next slide. In diagnostics, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see strong growth of our BD MAX instruments and assays for use in COVID-19 testing. In addition, we had good traction with our serology test in April and as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re currently validating performance of an enhanced version of the kit. Additionally, we currently have point-of-care test for coronavirus in development leveraging the BD Veritor system. The team is working 24/7 to get this test to market as early as possible, but as Tom mentioned, we could still face some unforeseeable issues during the clinical evaluation phase. As a result, it\u2019s too early to talk about a specific timeline for this potential product and what the market opportunity may be, but it could be a meaningful driver of growth. And lastly, in our Biosciences business, our recovery will largely depend on when research labs and institutions reopened and how quickly these scale up to normal operations and resume capital spending. We have also seen some impact on clinical flow applications like leukemia and lymphoma testing because hospitals are focused on COVID-19. On the positive side, there is potential for a modest benefit should NIH or other COVID-19 stimulus programs receive funding. Now moving on to Slide 24. This is a view into what we saw in the month of April, which includes our preliminary sales results. Going forward, our Surgery and PI businesses will continue to see significant pressure as a result of elective procedure deferrals. In the month of April the decline and procedures impacted Surgery revenues by 50% to 70% and Interventional revenues by 30% to 40%. In China, Surgery revenues are still approximately 50% of pre-COVID expectation and across the U.S. and Europe, Surgical and Interventional revenues are down 60% to 90%. In terms of loss revenues, we saw a decline of approximately $60 million in our Surgery business and $50 million in Peripheral Intervention. Moving on to MMS, we saw increased demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity, which we do not expect to continue at the same pace moving forward. This was partially offset by continued delays in Pyxis and [indiscernible] installations, which we do expect to continue going forward. This resulted in a net tailwind to MMS of approximately $70 million. In our MDS business in the United States, we continue to see reduced demand in our acute and non-acute businesses due to continued softness and routine and elective procedures. Within the month of March, these negative impacts were offset by tailwind from COVID-related surge demand and distributed stocking. Conversely, in April as the virus curve began to flatten, the COVID search demand began to abate and the distributors acted accordingly. As a result in April, we saw revenue in the U.S. that was approximately 15% to 20% below pre-COVID expectations. In China while hospital volumes in April broadly returned as isolation restrictions have been lifted, revenues was still approximately 30% to 40% below pre-COVID expectations. And lastly in Europe we saw the continuation of some COVID surge demand with revenues approximately 5% above our pre-COVID expectations. Combined, we started the decline of approximately $50 million in April in MDS largely driven by lower volumes in China and the U.S. Correspondingly in UCC, we saw a decline of approximately $20 million related to Foley catheter demand in April. Moving on to diagnostics and pre-analytical systems continues lower routine testing volumes resulted in fewer specimen collections and lower non-COVID diagnostic testing. Conversely, demand for COVID related testing remained high. In terms of revenues, we saw a decline of approximately $40 million for the month of April. In addition, we expect more meaningful delays in large capital installations such as Kiestra as we move forward. And lastly in our Biosciences business, we saw a decline of approximately $20 million in April due to lab closures. We expect a continued negative impact on capital spending related to ongoing reduced research activity. If we aggregate the pluses and minuses across the portfolio, we estimate that COVID-19 had a negative impact of approximately $240 million in the month of April. And this impact was partially offset by a tailwind of approximately $70 million related to increased demand for Alaris Pump under medical necessarily in MMS that we do not anticipate will continue at the same pace moving beyond April. I would also like to remind you once again of my earlier comment regarding the pressure on margins due to the high fixed cost in our operations and lower sales on high margin products. We hope this level of transparency is helpful as you think about the diversity and enduring nature of the BD portfolio. And as you can see there are a number of variables which make it very difficult to provide guidance as the COVID-19 situation continues to progress and we get more clarity around each of these variables, we\u2019ll keep you informed. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to summarize the key messages from our presentation today. As the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, we are uniquely positioned to respond by leveraging our core capabilities and expertise to deliver solutions across the full continuum of care from research, to diagnosis and surveillance, to medication management, delivery and critical care. Our second quarter results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio despite the increased impact from COVID-19. Going forward, we have put initiatives in place to actively manage our business as we navigate the negative near term impact of the virus. Importantly, these measures include the actions we took to reinforce our strong cash and liquidity position. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value for all stakeholders and emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Thanks for that. Now like to open the call up to Q&A.\nOperator: Floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.\nTom Polen: Good morning Kristen\nChris Reidy: Hey Kristen are you there?\nTom Polen: Are you on mute?\nKristen Stewart: Are we okay?\nTom Polen: Yes we can now.\nKristen Stewart: Oh good.\nTom Polen: Hey Chris.\nKristen Stewart: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much and thanks for all you guys are doing out there on the frontline. And really thank you for all the transparency, the slide deck is really fantastic. So I really appreciate all that you guys put into that. I\u2019m sure that was a lot of work.\nTom Polen: Thank you.\nKristen Stewart : I just wanted to kind of ask a little bit more and dive into just kind of what you are seeing just kind of on the medication management side, just with the puts and takes there. So, I was just kind of curious just in terms of -- with medical necessity and just kind of what you are seeing with the increase on sets and whatnot. I know you talked about the $70 million and kind of inferred that that was not something we should extrapolate going forward. I\u2019m just kind of curious as to, I guess, why not assume kind of a continued benefit for that kind of product line. I guess, we had all hoped that since you were getting medical necessity that that could be something that we could expect to continue for the rest of the year, and maybe just any additional details that you could give on that, a little bit of slippage on that 510 K. If there\u2019s anything you can add, that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Hey Kristen, this is Tom. Good question. So let me talk about maybe the 510(k) piece first, and then I can turn it over to Chris to give a little bit more color on the financial components there. So, on the 510(k), the main factor there that really drove the commentary around the delay is, of course one of the biggest areas of testing which we have to complete as part of the filing is human factor testing. So that\u2019s -- for those not familiar with it, that\u2019s going to \u2013 all the variety of people who could be using the pump, training naive healthcare workers, people who aren\u2019t familiar with using the pump, having them use the instructions for use and be able to successfully make infusions. Of course in a pandemic, it\u2019s more challenging to access the nursing staff, et cetera, to get that testing done in a timely way. So that\u2019s the number one main item. And then in addition, we are evaluating feedback that we got from that 483 to understand are there any implications to the 510(k) submission. It\u2019s too early to comment or there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s specific from that, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re evaluating. Again, we\u2019re continuing to work very collaboratively with the FDA, and we\u2019ll provide you an update on the August earnings call. Again, we\u2019re very focused on getting that in as soon as possible, but we\u2019re also extremely focused on making sure that it gets done right, so that once it does get submitted, it can go through the process as fast as possible. Right? So, let me turn it over to Chris just to give an update on the numbers. And just maybe one caveat is, I think the $70 million that you referred to, that\u2019s a net number in MMS that has a higher number for infusion that\u2019s partially offset by some takes in other areas.\nChris Reidy: That\u2019s exactly right. So, I guess the way to think about this is, in the second quarter we had $10 million of medical necessity that really wasn\u2019t COVID-related, that was kind of normal medical necessity that we would have expected when we gave guidance last quarter. We had something similar to that in the month of April as well. But above and beyond that, we had a spike in medical necessity for Alaris Pumps as you might imagine in the peak of the fight against the pandemic. And so that spiked, we did have a bit of offset from the Pyxis installations and Rowa installations, et cetera, but the bulk of that was the spike in the Alaris. Now, as we look going forward, we would expect that spike to abate somewhat. Not completely, but we would expect it to abate in May and in June and not be at the same levels as it was in April. We would also expect to see a little bit of a spike in the deferral of Pyxis and Rowa installations and keep that \u2013 that would keep going. So that would offset. So as you think about the next few months, we just wanted to make sure people were clear that we would expect that $70 million to come down in May and June. \nTom Polen: Again, that\u2019s just based on assumptions that COVID-19 will abate over that period of time and then hospitals may recognize that the need for this additional building of ICU beds may not need to continue at the same pace, but if that were to change, of course, the situation would change.\nKristen Stewart : Got you. And then I guess what can you tell us a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of early days now just across the country here in the United States? You guys are in a unique spot just with all your touch points at hospitals, just from a recovery perspective. Are you seeing signs that in some places that things are starting to get a little better, just in terms of surgeries, and what you\u2019re seeing maybe within the Interventional business or just in terms of hospital census [ph] starting to pop back up, are you starting to get a little bit more optimistic, or are things -- I\u2019m sure things are very regionalized and anything you can kind of add there that\u2019d be helpful.\nTom Polen: So good question. I think that your last comment there is very accurate, it is very regionalized. And we certainly \u2013 we\u2019re doing a lot of primary research surveys of our customers directly to have that real time data. And what our data shows is again a very regionalized kind of healthcare recovery areas like Texas, a few other states we see elective procedures really ramping back up strongly. Again, you\u2019ll see that though in pockets you\u2019ll see certain hospitals could be back at 90% of elective procedures and in hernia to where they were before. And then the hospital down the road is saying we\u2019re not doing that for another 30 days. And they\u2019re basically still at a 90% drop-off. But we are seeing it generally begin to increase in certain regions early in late April in particular. And I think we\u2019ve reflected that a bit. But it\u2019s still early days. I think the other thing is I\u2019m getting increasing calls, probably fair to say over the last couple of weeks if you step back a month or two, a lot of the dialogues that I was having with CEOs of many of our largest customers were around getting access for diagnostics for patients in need of coronavirus diagnosis today. Today, I get a lot more of those calls where those needs are being better met today and people are looking at now getting access to tests to start screening patients prior to them coming into elective surgery. And that is happening, I\u2019d say much more on a national basis. So even if they haven\u2019t actually started doing the procedures yet, pretty standard across the nation I see the people are starting to think about and putting in place timelines for how they are going to get those elective procedures back up and running. And they are thinking about how testing is going to be used to actually test people before they come in. And so we\u2019re seeing that occur. And I think that\u2019s a sign, a positive sign of people\u2019s intentions and the timing of those intentions.  So we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated as that progresses but just a few of the things that may be helpful.\nKristen Stewart: Thank you so much. Take care.\nTom Polen: Okay, thanks Kristen. Be safe. \nKristen Stewart: You too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nTom Polen: Hey David.\nChris Reidy: Good morning David. There seems to be a pause David?\nDavid Lewis: Good morning.\nChris Reidy: There you are.\nDavid Lewis: Can you hear me?\nChris Reidy: Yes we can.\nDavid Lewis: Great, that\u2019s good news. I got one thing right this morning. So just a quick diagnostic question, a diagnostic follow-up, either for Tom or Roberto. So the first question is just on, I appreciate the update on Veritor this morning. I wonder, I know it\u2019s kind of a fluid situation, but are we talking weeks away or months away? And then if you could get approved, what type of potential manufacturing capacity can we think about post EUA approval? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nTom Polen: A good question, David. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in clinical testing right now with patient samples. So at that phase we have an assay that we\u2019ve developed and we\u2019re testing for performance to generate data that if it works we could submit for EUA approval. So that\u2019s where we are. I always \u2013 we\u2019re cautious and one of the things we always talk about internally is of course typically it\u2019s a three-year process to develop these assets and get them through clinical studies and approved. We are doing that in three months essentially. And so, even where it could be a couple of weeks away from submitting an EUA in the general timeline of what you can learn in that window. You are learning almost a year of what you had normally learned because that also includes manufacturing, scale-up, et cetera. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re a bit cautious to give specifics yet because there\u2019s still a lot to learn even though it\u2019s a relative \u2013 could be a relatively short period of time. So more to come as we complete our clinical testing, we started that clinical testing last week. I can share that. And again, pending the results of that testing we have already had discussions with the FDA on pre-EUA filing discussions. And so we know what it takes to get that product through. And again, pending the testing results, the study results we\u2019ll be in a position to file. Concurrently we have been working to ramp up our production of that assay. So our manufacturing teams are ready, we\u2019ve actually started to invest in some additional equipment as well so that we would be in a position to scale that over the balance of the year in a meaningful way.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful.\nTom Polen: We\u2019re doing millions of tests, right, millions of tests, not a million millions a week.\nDavid Lewis: Okay, so production capacity is not going to be limited there. Thank you. And then just kind of related questions for you, Tom or others, of BD MAX production right now is sort of a third of your peers within that testing, can anything be done to ramp up BD MAX production capacity? And then just, love to get your kind of macro views on serology or immunity testing, what do you think there\u2019s significant demand for point-of-care immunity test or you think most of that demand is really going to get filled by some of the larger IVD analyzer companies? Thanks so much for all you are doing this morning.\nTom Polen: Yes, thanks David. So on MAX, you are right, there are peers that have much higher volume on very different platforms of course. They are high throughput platforms which are designed for that. Obviously the benefit of BD MAX is that it is more of a real time system that\u2019s much more usable in select hospital settings that aren\u2019t going to have those high throughput platforms. So, at this point in time, I\u2019d say that million tests a month is where we\u2019re at with our current systems and instrumentation that we have in manufacturing. We have approved and are proceeding to invest an additional capacity there. But the timing of that coming online, I\u2019m not ready to share that, but we are investing for additional capacity recognizing that we\u2019ll need that in the future as well. But about a million tests a month is what we\u2019re saying right now. In terms of immunology testing, we are seeing strong demand for point-of-care immunology testing. And we think that will continue certainly a central lab based approach is a good one. It does use a different specimen, the whole blood, obviously the convenience of the finger stick we see interest in that from an employer\u2019s, as well as healthcare providers being used from screening think about patients coming in and being able to do testing much more real time than having to send samples out and maybe a less invasive sample collection procedure as well. So we are seeing strong demand and we expect that will continue.\nDavid Lewis: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Richard Newitter. [SVB Leerink LLC]\nTom Polen: Hi Richard, good morning.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, can you hear me?\nChris Reidy: Yes we can.\nRichard Newitter: Okay, great. Thank you. And thanks for all of the detail in this morning\u2019s presentation or release. It was very helpful. I wanted to just maybe go back to the testing question, follow-up on David\u2019s, the old line of questioning here. So very helpful on color with respect to how your portfolio fits in perhaps on the hospital testing side. Can you give us any sense as to how you think the back to work on the more of the private sector and just kind of employers in general, what the algorithm is potentially going to be either at a national level or whatever you\u2019re seeing out there as a conversations are being had. Just trying to get a sense for how serology fits in with a point-of-care testing and/or kind of high-throughput testing, so what was other automated systems? Thanks.\nTom Polen: It\u2019s a great question, Rich. I don\u2019t have the algorithm figured out specifically yet. I would say that that, again, as we\u2019re thinking \u2013 as we\u2019re talking to our customers, we\u2019re getting a lot of interest on antigen testing to screen patients, at least before they come in for elective surgery. So I can make that comment that they\u2019re more focused on antigen testing what I\u2019m seeing then antibody for at least patients screening before they come in for surgery. Certainly as we think about employers getting their associates pace back to work, it\u2019ll be a mix. I would imagine. We are of course spending a lot of time ourselves thinking through that question. And we were very focused on prioritizing. We actually just communicated yesterday some phasing for starting to get some of our associates back to work next phase of our commercial teams being able to support customers in the field starting this month in the U.S. as an example and then starting to get increasing numbers of R&D associates back to work as the priority after that. And then we\u2019ll be working on more office based associates in extended period of time after that. And so I think you also expect regardless of the use of testing some phasing of people getting back to work based on the importance of them really being in what do they have to access in a work setting that they can\u2019t access from home.\nRichard Newitter: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just on the ramping production of the, the swab kits that you referenced, I think, you said millions per week by June. That\u2019s a substantial ramp from where you had been. Do you think that that will no longer \u2013 or seems to be a bottleneck for the testing situation, at least in the U.S. by that point in time? Is that the right level? And can you go even further than that? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Good question. So just to clarify that\u2019s three million a week by June is where we expect to be, that\u2019s up from 500,000 a week at the start of the crisis so it\u2019s a dramatic ramp. And of course we\u2019re heading strongly in that direction where we already at a couple of million a week. So the big thing that\u2019s happened there is \u2013 and we\u2019ve been right in the middle of that working with the FDA, other partners from across the industry as well as organizations like the Gates Foundation. At the start of the pandemic, there were very few products that were validated for testing. And so that was clearly a constraint at the beginning. What\u2019s happened now is there has been a lot of systematic work across the swab manufacturers as well as the test providers. And again organizations like the Gates Foundation who have been driving some of that testing in collaboration with the FDA to systematically expand to beyond viral transport media, which was limited to in the beginning to now other types of swabs including dry swabs and swabs in sailing, which have dramatically increased the capacity of the different types of devices that are available. And so, yes, I\u2019m not hearing significant issues on swab stopping testing. Today, I was getting a ton of those calls a month ago and that was an issue and we were very actively managing to make sure that testing didn\u2019t stop having our teams coming in at midnight on Sundays to package things up and drive them to the hospitals around the country and regionally to make sure the testing didn\u2019t stop. And we were really proud of the work that we did there. We don\u2019t get those calls anymore at this point in time or they are much more rare if they do occur.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Great, thank you. And good morning.\nTom Polen: Good morning Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Yes good morning. Again I appreciate all the detail. So just maybe one follow-up on April. And I realized this is a little bit short term, but we\u2019re also hungry for information. Regarding the $70 million, I realize you\u2019re saying that probably won\u2019t be sustained, but I\u2019m just curious if we sum up everything for the month of April, the positives and negatives related to COVID and then just the other parts of the business by my math that may be suggested in April, the total company revenues maybe down high single digits year-over-year. Is that ballpark or am I missing something?\nTom Polen: No, we\u2019re mid-teens down. So in total at the 240 level that\u2019s mid-teens and then somewhat offset by the $70 million.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. So that mid teens would not include the $70 million benefit that you are seeing. That\u2019s right. Okay, okay. And then the other thing I want to ask about is thinking a little bit longer term Tom you mentioned, hopefully, the progress being made on vaccines obviously vaccine will be a part of the solution there. I\u2019m just curious if we do get a vaccine do you guys have the capacity to meet that demand for J&J is out talking about a billion doses. Kind of how do you frame that for investors that BD being part of the solution and your ability to meet potential demand?\nTom Polen: Hey, it\u2019s a great question, Bob. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very active in talking to governments around the world. And what\u2019s important here is, is that people have to be proactive in beginning to order and stockpile these devices now, it cannot be waited until the last minute and expect that those products will be able to be manufactured because to your point, that scale can\u2019t be produced in that period of time. So we are seeing some governments around the world, we\u2019ve gotten very large orders already beginning that stockpile to cover the citizens in their country of vaccines. Others haven\u2019t done that yet. And we\u2019ve been really pretty much on a daily basis working with our public policy team to create greater awareness in governments of the need to start doing larger scale buys now. We have presented our production capabilities over the next a year. There are opportunities for us to invest further in capital, some of that we\u2019re doing proactively our self. But it needs to be done from a stockpiling perspective. And again, I think, there\u2019s further actions needed to do that. And again, we\u2019re working to help ensure that happens. That includes here in the U.S.\nChris Reidy: And just to be clear on your first question, Bob, when you adjust for that $70 million it comes out to low double digits impact on a year-over-year basis. \nBob Hopkins: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And yes, thank you for all the color. Just a couple of questions from me. One, Chris on the P&L I appreciate the color on the margin impact. Any other color you can provide on the P&L? For the second half it sounds like R&D you are going to maintain that spending. How should we think about SG&A and maybe some of the other lines of the P&L? And I had one follow-up.\nChris Reidy: Okay. Thanks, Larry it\u2019s a good question. And the way to think about it is a lot of what\u2019s being negatively impacting the business such as a surgery and PI we\u2019re fortunate to have very high gross margin profiles. So, think in the 70 plus kind of range. In addition to that, as you think about the impact you\u2019ve got to consider manufacturing variances which are going to impact the P&L as we adjust for the revenue and adjust our inventories accordingly which is the right thing to do. So, as we think about it, we\u2019re also making investments in COVID-related ramping as we\u2019ve talked about on the call here. So we\u2019re making those investments. We\u2019re also investing in the safety and health of our associates making our own PPNE which we talked about, facilities cleaning and those kinds of things. So those are additional costs. And then we\u2019re also seeing higher shipping costs as you are probably not surprised by. So when you take that and then we\u2019re taking \u2013 offsetting that we\u2019ve taken cost mitigating actions that we talked about in our remarks. We limited travel and hiring freeze early in the second quarter and we saw the benefits of that. But we\u2019ve also taken salary deductions for management and the Board, the 401k match, so that offsets things. So when you net all of that out, you should be thinking about the margin impact of the lost revenues going forward in that 75% kind of range when you net everything together. So hopefully that gives you some more color.\nLarry Biegelsen: Very helpful thanks. For my follow-up, Tom, how are you thinking about the long-term implications of coronavirus. You mentioned for BD and the industry, you mentioned in the slides, the shift of care to the non acute settings, for example. How does that impact BD? Thank you for taking the questions.\nChris Reidy: So we\u2019ve been \u2013 of course in our strategy, we\u2019ve been very specifically developing additional solutions for the nonacute sector, be it our Rowa platform for retail pharmacy, our Veritor platform or even commercial teams that we\u2019ve put in place, bringing our medication management solutions and including catheters, et cetera, into the surgery centers and non-acute. So we\u2019ve been shifting our resources in that direction. It\u2019s been a faster growing segment, but we\u2019ll certainly only increase in that direction going forward. I think you heard some of the announcements that we talked about today on our new product development platforms like the acquisition of Nat DX, which will give us a point-of-care molecular platform, to supplement, right? So Veritor will be a lateral flow based. This platform will be molecular based similar time to resolve we would expect as Veritor. Again, that\u2019s an investment that we\u2019re making, seeing that we expect diagnostics will continue to shift in that direction. We\u2019re making other investments even in our PAS business that allow self blood collection and other types of sample collection that are much more appropriate for the retail setting, et cetera. So we definitely see it a trend. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been investing in and will only continue to double down on that as we go forward.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Probably not surprisingly coming from me, some very Veritor questions here for you. Just kind of rapid fire. So, Tom, I wanted to confirm did you say millions per week? I think that\u2019s what you said I wanted to confirm that. And then are we talking about a COVID-19 assay and are there any plans for a combo flu AV COVID assay on that? Can you speak to the performance characteristics that you\u2019re expecting to be seen on that, especially relative to, I know you have to compare relative to PCR when you\u2019re doing these studies?\nTom Polen: Sure. Good, questions, Brian. Good morning. So yes, you heard right on Veritor that would be where we would be ramping up towards. We wouldn\u2019t have that available necessarily at launch. We will have that ramping up towards that way. We have plans and we\u2019ll share those plans from a timing perspective later on. From a performance perspective, again, we\u2019re in studies right now, so it\u2019s inappropriate to say what our performance is. We\u2019re getting actually that right now in clinical specimens, obviously we recognize the comparative to PCR is typical obviously for anything. We also recognize that these assays, they won\u2019t be as sensitive as PCR, no lateral flow assay is as sensitive as PCR, but no PCR assay is as ease of use, cost base, mobile as what you see in a platform like Veritor, which is why you see wide used applications in flu and strep testing still today. And it has a very important role. We see and we hear also from be it the FDA, the White House, other key constituents, our customers see a very important role in need for a lateral flow based COVID assay. We are focused on getting the COVID asset out first, Brian, the antigen test. And then to your point, can we add in a \u2013 combine that with our flu test in a single strip. Absolutely we\u2019ve started to think about that. That of course becomes much simpler to do once you confirm that the COVID assay is secure done, we\u2019ve launched that, then the ability to put that down with a flu test, both of which are now well characterized assays would be a next phase for us to think about.\nBrian Weinstein: Okay, great. And then as a follow-up going back to the pump business for a second, would you be willing to share some of the bigger observations that you received in the 483, just a kind of broad stroke, the things that you are going to be kind of looking to deal with here?\nTom Polen: Yes, Brian, we don\u2019t share those at this point in time, obviously we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019re working very closely with the FDA in that response. We\u2019ve actually already submitted our response plans on that. We\u2019ve already started taking actions on many of those and we\u2019ll share more as we go forward.\nBrian Weinstein: Understood, thank you.\nTom Polen: Yes, okay, thanks Brian.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nTom Polen : Rick good morning.\nRick Wise: Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Chris. Let me start again if I could with your excellent representation of what happened in April. Very clear. But I wanted to make sure I understood and pauses for the short term nature of it. Other large companies have been commenting on recent weekly trends and stuff like that. I\u2019m looking for something specific but have it indeed, did things get less bad or improve somewhat state as you will that last week of April into May? Are you seeing that? And as we think about, the reason I ask is that that $240 million negative April impact shouldn\u2019t we assume that that gets less bad? Yes, the $70 million positive will be less of a positive contribution, but shouldn\u2019t we assume that in coming months as things reopen that the $240 million goes down month by month?\nChris Reidy: Yes, so it\u2019s really hard to predict. There wasn\u2019t enough in the last week of April differential to really give us a sense of that. And when you think about it\u2019s really elective procedures. So we didn\u2019t see enough of a change in the elective procedures to be able to call May and to get any sense of anything changing. To your point around what might be up and down, we think that the lab closures, the impact in May might get a little bit worse and capital spending levels over the next couple of months would also be something that could get a little worse. And so it\u2019s just there\u2019s so many variables, it\u2019s what makes May and June, very, very hard to predict. And, I think we\u2019ll learn more as time goes on as you said, but there was nothing about the last week of April, that would give us a sense of where this is going. It\u2019s just too early to tell at this point.\nTom Polen: And Rick, maybe we take advantage we\u2019ve got. We do have Simon on the line. May be we turn over to Simon just for a quick comment on what you are seeing on the procedure side at a high level.\nSimon Campion: Yes, hey, Rick Eric, it\u2019s a final so in certain pockets we did see an uptick certainly in England on the ventral hernia. They are heavily reimbursed. They are also England, in particular, is very much outpatient based. So, they get the patients in, they treat them, they get reimbursed nicely and the patients go home. So that\u2019s been \u2013 that has picked up nicely at the back end of April. And also another point worth noting is something hit the back end of April, our salesforce began to receive more calls from their customers about beginning to re-attend cases. So, Tom said, we\u2019re about to let those at those guys loose here again in the in the middle of the month. And in fact just yesterday we began as shipping them all their PPE so that they can attend cases and go back into hospitals where they\u2019re allowed. So there are several things in certain pockets that are pointing in the right direction in respect to some aspects of our elective business.\nTom Polen: And just to clarify, our reps will not be going in just to hospitals unless they are specifically requested to attend a case. And I think as we see that \u2013 while we\u2019re seeing that in some very small subsets that Simon just described, I\u2019d say as we think about medical and life sciences, as Chris commented on not seeing that at any real difference at the end of April. For example, I can specimen collection or MDS, anything notable there difference.\nRick Wise: That\u2019s great. And Tom, maybe just one for you, your grow, simplify and empower initiatives, just focusing on the simplify aspect from a couple of angles, I know you\u2019ve focused and prioritized optimizing manual factoring efficiencies, cost reduction initiatives, SKU reduction, et cetera. What\u2019s happening to all those initiatives right now and you could \u2013 is this an appropriate time to accelerate those initiatives? Actually, ironically would that be helpful as we contemplate Becton\u2019s potential fixed costs as you might \u2013 as we recover from this COVID period. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Hey Rick, great question. Absolutely. So near term over the last two months, we\u2019ve actually \u2013 the work on the SKU rationalization has in fact accelerated to your point with folks at home, the ability to engage actually the sales team in working through products \u2013 the product list of what we\u2019re looking to remove from the portfolio, the substitute products actually been able to \u2013 number of teams have been able to engage them in a way which has been much more than we would have been able to do traditionally. Actually I think we had a number of businesses already starting that product simplification initiative. And that expanded pretty significantly across the company to other businesses during this window of time where the marketing teams, et cetera, were also had bandwidth to accelerate that work. So that\u2019s been one that we\u2019ve taken advantage of this period to double down on. In terms of the manufacturing, network consolidation that does continue to move forward. We haven\u2019t been able to necessarily accelerate that during this period of time. Obviously manufacturing teams focus primarily on supply right now and navigating that. Of course you can imagine every day there\u2019s items that we have to manage in our supply chain, as well as in our own facilities. But that is fully still moving forward in all ways and we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on that.\nRick Wise: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll ask both of them all in one. I noticed you took down your CapEx for the year by about $200 million hoping you could just touch on your thoughts around pipeline delays that are potential coming out of this. What should and shouldn\u2019t be effected. And then also, how are you thinking about your ability down the road, is this reduction in CapEx temporary? Could we see something more permanent come out of this? Really just how you are thinking about capital investing and your capital allocation in general plus the pipeline? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yes I\u2019ll start with that Robert, thanks for the question. And as you might imagine, the first thing that we wanted to make sure of is that we were able to mitigate the cash impact from the headwinds from COVID. And we\u2019ve made great progress on that in a few short weeks. And we are able to mitigate a substantial part of the, what we see as the capital impact. And we think that was the prudent thing to do. Now, one of those things that we did to get there in addition to some of the P&L items that we talked about that clearly impact P&L and cash. But from a cash perspective one of the items that we did take down was the CapEx. And we\u2019re prioritizing mission critical capital spending, and we\u2019re cutting and basically delaying some of the investments that we\u2019re making that are more discretionary. And we\u2019re being very careful on that because we want to make sure that we\u2019re not cutting anything that would inhibit any capacity going forward So we\u2019re being very targeted on that and it clearly is not a permanent adjustment in CapEx. We would expect that when we come out of this pandemic that we would, some of those things that we\u2019re cutting, we will are just deferring and we\u2019ll have to spend that. And so you can expect us to go back to the normal $900,000 to $1 billion kind of thing. And that is particularly true as we think about investing in areas that are necessary for COVID. We continue to invest in those areas, and ramp and make sure that we have capacity as terms articulated on a number of fronts. We\u2019re ramping capacity. So think of that as a temporary reduction. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I just wanted to circle back and if we could revisit some of Bob\u2019s question about the vaccine, given that could be a material ramp up, could you just remind us what kind of share you have, the global syringe market, how material that is for you today? And what it could mean if you were to get an order for, say, one billion syringes in Q1, would you be able to get there and how material would that be?\nTom Polen: Good question, Matt. So we don\u2019t share our specific shares on a global basis. We are, as we said, the leader in worldwide, we\u2019re clearly the leader in the U.S. And we make billions and billions of syringes and needles a year. We make billions and billions of them specifically just for the U.S. market as well each year. So to be able to provide it, let\u2019s just say in your example, a billion syringes spontaneously, there\u2019s not capacity to just provide those in a month. We have provided plans to different governments around the world where we can provide hundreds of millions of product and over months, periods of time. And there is opportunity to go above that, but it needs to be done in partnership with those governments. So again, some of those governments we\u2019ve engaged have strongly engaged with us to do that. Others are still working through their plans. On that point, what\u2019s most important is you\u2019ve got to get ahead of that and start to start to get those orders and things in now. The other thing is, it\u2019s just a little caveat there is the reason I hesitate is there is global capacity as well, there\u2019s certain products that we sell, for example, in the U.S. that we don\u2019t sell ex-U.S. and there\u2019s many products that we sell ex-U.S. that we don\u2019t sell in the U.S. So for example, we pretty much exclusively sell safety devices in the U.S. We have a lot of capacity of non-safety devices ex-U.S. In a pandemic vaccine delivery situation one may not prioritize the need for safety needles on the end of a vaccine delivery. And so you can free up additional capacity to come into the marketplace. But those, again that\u2019s working with the governments on the specific requirements. And the stockpiling, again, some governments have already started taking those actions aggressively, others we\u2019re really focused on getting them to act sooner. \nMatt Taylor: Understood, thanks for that. And then one follow-up, obviously you\u2019re seeing increased demand for fusion pumps. I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts given you touched so many points in the acute care setting, whether you think that hospitals and providers will in the medium term or the long run actually, permanently increase the size of their ICU or acute care capacity to be able to be responsive if there is a second wave or just ongoing COVID management.\nTom Polen: It\u2019s a good question. I honestly don\u2019t know the answer of that. That\u2019s something that I would imagine that that many hospitals are thinking about what it could be a second wave in the fall and next winter. And thinking about how they balance that, including some of these field hospitals that have been set up and how you think about those. In fairness, we haven\u2019t had deep discussions with our customers on the long-term implications of ICU beds and how they may or may not maintain that over a longer period of time. Certainly, particularly in the U.S., I think, that may be a little different in some areas like in Europe where you\u2019ve seen countries, you\u2019ve seen the stats of ICU beds per capita in different countries in Europe and how disparate those are. What we have heard were some of those countries that did not have as many ICU beds may want to permanently maintain a higher ratio of ICU beds. But I think that\u2019s on some that were well below benchmarking levels.\nMatt Taylor: Great, thanks for the clarification.\nTom Polen: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a follow-up similar question to Matt\u2019s most recent question. But just thinking about the potential need for hospitals to build out the capacity, maybe individual fleets, more Pyxis systems as they move forward to reopening and they are looking at distinct COVID-19 wards, or units, or floors versus non-COVID-19 units or floors and the potential to avoid cross-contamination even of medication delivery or these pumps?\nTom Polen: Josh, we\u2019re not seeing widespread requests for that at this point in time. And I think the question would be would they be reallocating? Remember, overall hospital utilization in the U.S. is still relatively low rate, it\u2019s not 90% across the board in normal terms, so how much they would allocate to COVID-specific wards, et cetera. I think that\u2019s still being figured out. Obviously all hospitals were being dedicated to that at this point in time. We don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s not visible today that there would be some type of spike in pump or Pyxis growth as people are trying to build a separate COVID systems from their main wards. But something we\u2019ll monitor but we\u2019re not seeing that today.\nJosh Jennings: Great. And then just to follow-up, I heard you mentioned that the Lutonix BTK submission was put forward or filed. Any incremental details you can share about back and forth with the FDA? What was required \u2013 what more was required from Becton for that submission? And any comments on just your confidence for approval? Thanks a lot.\nTom Polen: Yes, we can\u2019t comment really with many details at this point in time. Obviously it includes a number of additional clinical data studies that were generated on BTK. And we submitted those various data sets to the FDA. So again, we believe that there remains a significant unmet need for that patient population that there\u2019s not strong alternatives for today. We strongly believe in the safety of the BTK product and it\u2019s under active review. So we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated as it progresses. But we\u2019ve submitted the data that we believe isn\u2019t complete and so it\u2019s now under the review process. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. We will now turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for your closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay, well thanks everyone for the great discussion today. As I close today\u2019s call, I\u2019m reminded of something a mentor of mine once shared, which is that crisis doesn\u2019t make character, it reveals character. And that\u2019s truly the way, I think, that we\u2019ve seen BD respond here that the COVID-19 crisis has really revealed the best of BD reinforcing the commitment of our associates who never forget that there\u2019s a patient at the end of everything we do. It\u2019s revealed the breadth, the depth and necessity of our product portfolio reinforcing the central role we play from discovery and diagnosis to the delivery of care and treatment of disease and it\u2019s revealed our ability to adapt and innovate, mustering our resources to bring new solutions to help solve healthcare\u2019s biggest problems. That track record is why healthcare providers and health officials worldwide have put their trust in us during the most significant health crisis in the past century. And it\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we will continue to drive growth, innovation, and value creation in the many categories we serve long after COVID-19 has been contained. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the road to recovery for the healthcare industry and global economy is going to take some time. It\u2019s likely to have its own bumps, but I\u2019m confident BD will navigate these near term challenges, take the necessary actions and execute our strategy to emerge strong. I\u2019ve been so inspired by the response of BD associates. We have an incredibly dedicated and committed team. And I can\u2019t thank the team enough for going above and beyond in these challenging times. I want to thank all of you for your time today. Stay well.\nChris Reidy: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. I certainly hope you and your families are doing well as we navigate this unprecedented time. Our thoughts are particularly with those personally affected by COVID-19, including healthcare workers on the frontline who are caring for patients and battling this virus. As you've seen in our press release, our second quarter results were ahead of our expectations even though the Q2 impact for COVID-19 was larger than we anticipated. While we've seen strength in our portfolio that's more directly tied to COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we're also experiencing significant pressure in other areas such as products relied on elective procedures, research, and routine care. Chris will cover this in more detail later in the call. This remains a dynamic situation, and the timing and phasing of research and more elective healthcare returning is hard to predict. That's why we've decided to withdraw our guidance for FY 2020. As I've shared in the past, you can expect transparency and straight talk, and so Chris will share with you what we know so far including what we saw in April, and he'll give you more color on the many factors impacting recovery. Before we get into the impact to our business, I want to spend time on BD's response to COVID-19, because I believe it embodies what we stand for and our purpose and what makes BD unique. And so on Slide 4, I'd like to start by sharing my deepest thanks to the BD team around the world. I've been with the company nearly 20 years and it never ceases to amaze me how our team rises to the occasion for our customers, especially during times of uncertainty. What I've seen in the last two months is truly inspirational, and I'm so proud to serve alongside this team. Turn to Slide 5. We defined four priorities that have guided our response to COVID-19 since January when we convened our crisis management team. First was to protect the health and safety of our employees. Second, maintain business continuity and mobilize our world-class operations to help combat the pandemic. Third, bring new solutions across the entire continuum of care from discovery and diagnosis to delivery of care. And fourth take proactive measures and continue to advance our strategy so that we ultimately can emerge from this pandemic strong and in a better position. And while we are actively working to address near-term pressures related to COVID-19, we will always operate our business for long-term value creation. I'll discuss each of these in more detail now. First, protecting the health and safety of our associates, on Slide 6. We took a number of actions very early on to help safeguard our team, including adapting the workplace for social distancing, increasing cleaning and disinfection protocols, and adding temperature monitoring at our manufacturing and distribution centers, beginning in February. We've also increased personal protective equipment for employees, including leveraging our 3D printing and large scale molding capabilities to manufacture our own face shields so we can further protect our employees. Even as we made our own difficult decisions to furlough a small percentage of our manufacturing associates, we preserved full access to healthcare benefits for impacted associates in the U.S., including covering both the employer and the employee payroll reductions during the furlough period. Turning to Slide 7 and our second priority, mobilizing global operations. As you know, world-class manufacturing excellence is a core competency and focus for BD. All of our critical to COVID manufacturing and distribution centers are operating at or near full capacity. You can imagine that's not easy in this environment. We have BD associates stepping up around the world to make this happen. Just one example is we've had more than 100 of our manufacturing associates from Malaysia volunteer to temporarily relocate to live in Singapore during the border closure. They moved away from their families to Singapore in the middle of the pandemic just to help maintain operations at our Singapore plant. Two thirds of all BD associates or more than 43,000 of our workforce who work in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and field service roles have continued to come into BD or to customer sites nearly every day during this crisis to help ensure our products and solutions are there when patients need us most. And I thank each and every one of them for that. We've leveraged our scale and ramp production to the highest degree possible in this environment, and three examples stand out to me. First is to reduce the risk of exposure to caregivers. Some clinicians move the Alaris system from the bedside to outside the patient room dramatically increasing demand for IV extension sets. BD team responded with urgency, increasing production of these sets 100-fold within just a month. We've dramatically increased the number and types of specimen collection swabs from about 500,000 each week in February to an expected 3 million in June \u2013 3 million a week in June. We've significantly scaled production of our BD MAX reagents used for open-assay tests including our new molecular assay for COVID-19. We have increased output of open-assay kits by more than 80-fold between February and June and we're currently manufacturing six times more each month than we did all of last year and we continue to scale that up. We're also looking ahead recognizing a potential second wave of COVID-19 which could align timing wise with flu season. We're preparing additional capacity to ensure we can address both demand for a flu test and an antigen COVID-19 assay. Given that the symptoms are pretty similar, we're also anticipating potential higher demand this fall as well. I also want to reassure you that we've ramped production as we've ramped production our commitment and focus to delivering the highest quality products has remained extremely unfocused. While we're experiencing historically high demand for critical to COVID products, there's also negative pressure on product categories tied to routine health care visits and lab testing, elective procedures, and non-COVID research. For example, during Q2, we began to see a significant decline in elective procedures. During the end of the second quarter, demand for research reagents and instruments slowed dramatically as research institutions and labs temporarily closed due to lockdown. As a result, we have temporarily slowed or suspended production at a few of our non-COVID related manufacturing sites to preserve liquidity. We're in frequent contact with our customers and we're closely monitoring demand signals and we're ready to start immediately \u2013 resumed production immediately as soon as those procedures and research restarts. Our ability to adapt and mobilize our global operations to respond to the pandemic is a testament to our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities, the dedication of our employees and the strength of our public-private partnerships. Throughout the pandemic, we've regularly engaged federal, state and local government officials around the world to help safeguard operations and minimize the risk of supply chain disruption. It's clear the strength of our global operations network is a significant advantage for BD and the healthcare providers who rely on us.  Turning to Slide 8, another advantage unique to BD is the strength and diversity of our portfolio, which I believe, as I've said in the past, is unmatched in our industry. We're leveraging our expertise and capabilities to deliver solutions across the continuum from research to understand immune response to diagnosis and surveillance, to medication management, delivery and critical care, and ultimately to prevention as we look ahead to a potential vaccination campaign. First, in order to treat a disease, you have to better understand it. And that's why scientific research on COVID-19 continues to move forward even as many labs and institutions pause or postpone other important studies. And our Biosciences business has been helping researchers better understand how the immune system responds to COVID-19 and why some people are more effected and others show only mild or no symptoms. And we believe this scientific research is key to better understanding and ultimately battling COVID-19. Turning to Slide 9. We've launched a full portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostic solutions which help healthcare providers answer two basic questions, who has it and who had it? And so as you think about who has COVID-19, we've leveraged our strength in molecular diagnostics to bring the market three molecular tests, two as a CE mark and two that have received EUA approval from the FDA in the U.S. These tests are designed exclusively for the BD MAX system, which has already in use at over 1,000 laboratories worldwide. The tests are conducted on onsite, mostly at hospital labs, and increased time to result to just two to three hours of up to 24 samples at a time. We've now shipped test kits to more than 500 hospitals around the world and moving forward we're able to provide approximately 250,000 tests per week or about 1 million a month. We're also hard at work developing a forced [ph] diagnostic point-of-care antigen test that leverages our Veritor platform targeted to diagnose COVID-19 in less than 15 minutes. There's broad interest in this test and with nearly 30,000 Veritor devices already in mostly non-acute care centers across the U.S. We expect this could be a real game changer for testing capacity and helping and restoring the economy. This test is still under development and we're evaluating performance with samples now. Pending that outcome, we would submit for EUA authorization and we'll keep you updated as this progresses. To test for who had COVID-19, we've partnered with BioMedomics to market a serology test that can detect antibodies in blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19 in as little as 15 minutes. In fact, the published data in the Journal of Medical Virology was one of the world's first for COVID-19 serology test. Given the latest guidelines from the FDA on performance characteristics for EUA approval of serology tests, we're currently validating performance of a second generation enhanced version of this kit which is produced and we are testing moving forward with that testing now. We are proud of the portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics. We've built and launched in record time to help address this urgent public health need. Turn to Slide 10. And our solutions for treatment and care. BD's global scale is nearly unparalleled enabling patient care in almost every country around the world. In fact, about 90% of patients that enter an acute care setting are touched by a BD product. Although overall hospital utilization is down due to COVID-19, countries and healthcare providers have been preparing for the worst, setting up surge field hospitals and expanding ICU beds. BD teams around the world answered the call working to help set up these facilities and ensure access to critical to COVID medical technologies. For an example, we recently saw increased demand for our Pyxis rapid emergency deployment offering where we can deploy and install Pyxis med stations in about a week to help set up temporary field hospitals like we did at the McCormick center in Chicago. We've also seen high demand for our portfolio of vascular access devices, infusion sets and injection devices which are critical to safe and effective medication delivery. Hospitals have also turned to our targeted temperature management devices to help in the care of symptomatic COVID-19 patients and we've seen strong demand for our acute dialysis catheters as one of the complications of serious COVID-19 is a multiple organ failure including acute kidney injury. I also want to comment on infusion pumps, which as you know are critical devices in acute care and especially the ICU as each patient on a ventilator is often connected to multiple infusion systems. Outside of the U.S., we have more than tripled manufacturing and customer shipments of our infusion pumps for EMEA in response to COVID-19. We've accelerated the distribution agreement that will expand BD's offering an infusion and help address rising demand for infusion pumps in select countries throughout Europe. And I'll speak to this in further detail later on. In the U.S., we've established a process for existing customers at the BD Alaris system to receive additional Alaris pumps upon certification of medical necessity. Our team is continuing to work diligently and with urgency to prepare the comprehensive five, 10-K filing we discussed in February. And while our team has been driving to submit that filing in the fourth quarter due to challenges associated with the global pandemic among other factors, we anticipate extending our initial timing for submission until after Q4. We don't have a more precise timing at this point and we're actively continuing to collaborate closely with the FDA to ensure we meet their expectations. I want to ensure you that we are committed to getting this done and done right. It's our top priority and we've added significant dedicated resources. We're making significant incremental investments and we're rotating in top talent from across BD to drive this program to completion. My executive team is directly on this on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that we are best positioned to work through any potential obstacles that might challenge our progress. And as I said, this is the critical priority for the company. In connection to the charge that Monique described, we're working with the FDA following their onsite inspection of our MMS facility in San Diego during the quarter. The FDA made a number of observations in a Form 83 notice we received an April and why we were early in the process. We were already beginning to implement certain corrective actions to address the observations. We're also taking this seriously and we're working collaboratively with the FDA and making necessary investments and keeping our focus on quality and doing what's right for our customers and patients. We're going to continue to keep you posted on our progress here. Finally, looking ahead to the development of a potential vaccine, we're an active and ongoing discussions with multiple countries around the world to provide the maximum support possible for the world's response to COVID-19 including production of syringes for potential large scale vaccination campaign. As the world's largest manufacturer of needles and syringes, we have already ramped up production of injection devices in anticipation of a surgeon demand for these products. It's important to acknowledge, of course, that BD is not immune to the financial impacts of the coronavirus, which we certainly saw in China this quarter. And while our underlying pre-COVID business remains strong as evidenced by our solid Q2 results. We expect to continue to see significant pressure on certain businesses as we move forward. And on Slide 11, I want to give you a better sense of these headwinds and the uncertainties around the pace of recovery, which Chris is going to explain in more detail. So elective and non-urgent procedures are down significantly, which is having a direct impact on our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention portfolio. There's a wide range here with elective procedures for oncology and end-stage renal disease being least impacted and our hernia and peripheral arterial disease and biosurgery businesses being the most impacted. As some states begin to allow elective procedures to resume this month, there's clear interest and willingness by hospitals and physicians to restart elective procedures in a controlled and phased way. A survey of our top accounts that we've done indicates that 80% of our customers want to begin resuming these elective procedures by some degree by early June. While our customers clearly want to restart procedures, there are some questions of patient's readiness to return and we're monitoring that closely as well. We certainly have to date has seen sentiment among patients mix, particularly for procedures that fall in the mid-range of procedure prioritization. Secondly, with non-COVID hospitalization down, we're monitoring the impact of our business both in terms of products used in inpatient care as well as to capital budget. Since China and several other countries are a few months ahead of the U.S., we're closely monitoring their recovery and utilization to see what we can expect as we look forward. In diagnostics, we're seeing strong demand for our comprehensive portfolio of COVID-19 offerings, however, the deferral of routine care as you know is having a significant negative impact on diagnostic testing overall, which of course leads to temporarily lower use of sample collection devices. Again, we're closely watching China here to see what we can learn about the pace of recovery for routine tests and sample collection. And in research where temporary lab closers have had an immediate and significant impact on demand for our Biosciences reagents and research instruments. We expect recovery is going to take some time. We're paying attention to when researchers going to be able to head back to work and how long it's going to take for lab testing and experiments to restart. In anticipation of the pressures, we're now seeing in our business. We've been very prudent and proactive taking swift action to reduce costs and reinforce our strong liquidity position. And Chris is going to speak in greater detail to those in just a few moments. At the same time, we're taking proactive measures. We're also continuing to advance our long-term growth strategy and prepare for our next phase of value creation. In each of our segments, we're deeply focused on executing our strategies to grow, simplify and empower as shown on Slide 12. We're always going to drive growth through category innovation and we're not taking our foot off the gas when it comes to R&D. Across each of our segments, we have a strong portfolio with a robust innovation pipeline that's weighted towards solutions for faster growing markets.  During the quarter, we continued our strong cadence of delivering our R&D pipeline, introducing nine new products in the quarter. Let me share a few highlights of our strategic progress to demonstrate why I'm confident we're seizing the right opportunities to emerge from this pandemic strong. In medical, I mentioned earlier we had accelerated the distribution agreement with Medcaptain Medical Technology Company, who developed in CE marked and innovative new infusion pump platform that's tailored for the European market and we're very pleased with the first steps in this collaboration and it's enabling us to help advance our medication management presence in the region as well as our global expansion strategy. In interventional, we're continuing to execute our strategy and advanced solutions for faster growing markets. During the quarter, we released both the 300 millimeter and AV low-profile Lutonix balloon. Supported by these launches, we continue to see sequential improvement in the use of drug coated balloons prior to COVID. We were also early in our launch of Dry Dock 2.0 which is a technology designed to enable the continued use of the PureWick female incontinent device in the post acute and in the home. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Straub Medical, which is a privately held company focused on devices that treat or restore blood flow to clotted or blocked vessels. This acquisition further expands our portfolio with a proven device with \u2013 it's approved with dual indications for arterial atherectomy and thrombectomy in the U.S. It has solid existing sales in Europe and China. We'd be leveraging our strong existing channel and expertise in endovascular technology as we bring this product to the U.S. and accelerate existing sales around the world.  Finally, within BDI last week, we completed the submission of additional data for Lutonix BTK filing. This is now continuing FDA review. Turning to Life Sciences. This quarter we launched the FACSymphony S6 system, our new cell sorter with six-way sorting and up to 60 panels of detection. The S6 enables an end-to-end solution for high parameter cellular analysis and reinforces our commitment to research solutions. We also launched the BD Kiestra ReadA instrument in Europe and we submitted the five, 10-K filing with the FDA this quarter. Continuing to execute on our strategy of modular laboratory automation solutions, the BD ReadA system \u2013 the BD Kiestra ReadA system transforms the manual hands-on workflow of plate reading into a fully automated and digital process that enhances lab efficiency and reduces time to result. I also want to give you an update on our launch of the BD core system in Europe, which as you'll recall, is a fully automated molecular platform for high volume labs. When we announced this new innovation last quarter, we were still very early in the launch. The BD core continues to exceed our expectations and installations move forward even in light of COVID-19, I think reinforcing the customer interest in this platform. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NAT Diagnostics, an early stage company with a very innovative platform in the fast growing molecular point of care market. This acquisition will ultimately extend the breadth of BD solution offerings into molecular point of care testing. We are advancing this new molecular point-of-care platform in development and we'll keep you updated as this system advances closer towards launch in the next few years. I'm excited about the progress we're making and the three agreements we've completed, the Straub Medical, NAT Diagnostics, and Medcaptain, which are evident that we continue to invest in growth in all three segments even during this pandemic. And while we're navigating real near-term pressures, I'm confident the steps we're taking now will put BD in the best position for the long term. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Good morning Kristen Are you on mute? Yes we can now. Hey Chris. Thank you. Hey Kristen, this is Tom. Good question. So let me talk about maybe the 510(k) piece first, and then I can turn it over to Chris to give a little bit more color on the financial components there. So, on the 510(k), the main factor there that really drove the commentary around the delay is, of course one of the biggest areas of testing which we have to complete as part of the filing is human factor testing. So that's -- for those not familiar with it, that's going to \u2013 all the variety of people who could be using the pump, training naive healthcare workers, people who aren't familiar with using the pump, having them use the instructions for use and be able to successfully make infusions. Of course in a pandemic, it's more challenging to access the nursing staff, et cetera, to get that testing done in a timely way. So that's the number one main item. And then in addition, we are evaluating feedback that we got from that 483 to understand are there any implications to the 510(k) submission. It's too early to comment or there's nothing that's specific from that, but it's something that we're evaluating. Again, we're continuing to work very collaboratively with the FDA, and we'll provide you an update on the August earnings call. Again, we're very focused on getting that in as soon as possible, but we're also extremely focused on making sure that it gets done right, so that once it does get submitted, it can go through the process as fast as possible. Right? So, let me turn it over to Chris just to give an update on the numbers. And just maybe one caveat is, I think the $70 million that you referred to, that's a net number in MMS that has a higher number for infusion that's partially offset by some takes in other areas. Again, that's just based on assumptions that COVID-19 will abate over that period of time and then hospitals may recognize that the need for this additional building of ICU beds may not need to continue at the same pace, but if that were to change, of course, the situation would change. So good question. I think that your last comment there is very accurate, it is very regionalized. And we certainly \u2013 we're doing a lot of primary research surveys of our customers directly to have that real time data. And what our data shows is again a very regionalized kind of healthcare recovery areas like Texas, a few other states we see elective procedures really ramping back up strongly. Again, you'll see that though in pockets you'll see certain hospitals could be back at 90% of elective procedures and in hernia to where they were before. And then the hospital down the road is saying we're not doing that for another 30 days. And they're basically still at a 90% drop-off. But we are seeing it generally begin to increase in certain regions early in late April in particular. And I think we've reflected that a bit. But it's still early days. I think the other thing is I'm getting increasing calls, probably fair to say over the last couple of weeks if you step back a month or two, a lot of the dialogues that I was having with CEOs of many of our largest customers were around getting access for diagnostics for patients in need of coronavirus diagnosis today. Today, I get a lot more of those calls where those needs are being better met today and people are looking at now getting access to tests to start screening patients prior to them coming into elective surgery. And that is happening, I'd say much more on a national basis. So even if they haven't actually started doing the procedures yet, pretty standard across the nation I see the people are starting to think about and putting in place timelines for how they are going to get those elective procedures back up and running. And they are thinking about how testing is going to be used to actually test people before they come in. And so we're seeing that occur. And I think that's a sign, a positive sign of people's intentions and the timing of those intentions.  So we'll continue to keep you updated as that progresses but just a few of the things that may be helpful. Okay, thanks Kristen. Be safe. Hey David. A good question, David. So it's \u2013 we're in clinical testing right now with patient samples. So at that phase we have an assay that we've developed and we're testing for performance to generate data that if it works we could submit for EUA approval. So that's where we are. I always \u2013 we're cautious and one of the things we always talk about internally is of course typically it's a three-year process to develop these assets and get them through clinical studies and approved. We are doing that in three months essentially. And so, even where it could be a couple of weeks away from submitting an EUA in the general timeline of what you can learn in that window. You are learning almost a year of what you had normally learned because that also includes manufacturing, scale-up, et cetera. And so that's why we're a bit cautious to give specifics yet because there's still a lot to learn even though it's a relative \u2013 could be a relatively short period of time. So more to come as we complete our clinical testing, we started that clinical testing last week. I can share that. And again, pending the results of that testing we have already had discussions with the FDA on pre-EUA filing discussions. And so we know what it takes to get that product through. And again, pending the testing results, the study results we'll be in a position to file. Concurrently we have been working to ramp up our production of that assay. So our manufacturing teams are ready, we've actually started to invest in some additional equipment as well so that we would be in a position to scale that over the balance of the year in a meaningful way. We're doing millions of tests, right, millions of tests, not a million millions a week. Yes, thanks David. So on MAX, you are right, there are peers that have much higher volume on very different platforms of course. They are high throughput platforms which are designed for that. Obviously the benefit of BD MAX is that it is more of a real time system that's much more usable in select hospital settings that aren't going to have those high throughput platforms. So, at this point in time, I'd say that million tests a month is where we're at with our current systems and instrumentation that we have in manufacturing. We have approved and are proceeding to invest an additional capacity there. But the timing of that coming online, I'm not ready to share that, but we are investing for additional capacity recognizing that we'll need that in the future as well. But about a million tests a month is what we're saying right now. In terms of immunology testing, we are seeing strong demand for point-of-care immunology testing. And we think that will continue certainly a central lab based approach is a good one. It does use a different specimen, the whole blood, obviously the convenience of the finger stick we see interest in that from an employer's, as well as healthcare providers being used from screening think about patients coming in and being able to do testing much more real time than having to send samples out and maybe a less invasive sample collection procedure as well. So we are seeing strong demand and we expect that will continue. Hi Richard, good morning. It's a great question, Rich. I don't have the algorithm figured out specifically yet. I would say that that, again, as we're thinking \u2013 as we're talking to our customers, we're getting a lot of interest on antigen testing to screen patients, at least before they come in for elective surgery. So I can make that comment that they're more focused on antigen testing what I'm seeing then antibody for at least patients screening before they come in for surgery. Certainly as we think about employers getting their associates pace back to work, it'll be a mix. I would imagine. We are of course spending a lot of time ourselves thinking through that question. And we were very focused on prioritizing. We actually just communicated yesterday some phasing for starting to get some of our associates back to work next phase of our commercial teams being able to support customers in the field starting this month in the U.S. as an example and then starting to get increasing numbers of R&D associates back to work as the priority after that. And then we'll be working on more office based associates in extended period of time after that. And so I think you also expect regardless of the use of testing some phasing of people getting back to work based on the importance of them really being in what do they have to access in a work setting that they can't access from home. Yeah. Good question. So just to clarify that's three million a week by June is where we expect to be, that's up from 500,000 a week at the start of the crisis so it's a dramatic ramp. And of course we're heading strongly in that direction where we already at a couple of million a week. So the big thing that's happened there is \u2013 and we've been right in the middle of that working with the FDA, other partners from across the industry as well as organizations like the Gates Foundation. At the start of the pandemic, there were very few products that were validated for testing. And so that was clearly a constraint at the beginning. What's happened now is there has been a lot of systematic work across the swab manufacturers as well as the test providers. And again organizations like the Gates Foundation who have been driving some of that testing in collaboration with the FDA to systematically expand to beyond viral transport media, which was limited to in the beginning to now other types of swabs including dry swabs and swabs in sailing, which have dramatically increased the capacity of the different types of devices that are available. And so, yes, I'm not hearing significant issues on swab stopping testing. Today, I was getting a ton of those calls a month ago and that was an issue and we were very actively managing to make sure that testing didn't stop having our teams coming in at midnight on Sundays to package things up and drive them to the hospitals around the country and regionally to make sure the testing didn't stop. And we were really proud of the work that we did there. We don't get those calls anymore at this point in time or they are much more rare if they do occur. Good morning Bob. No, we're mid-teens down. So in total at the 240 level that's mid-teens and then somewhat offset by the $70 million. Hey, it's a great question, Bob. And it's something that we've been very active in talking to governments around the world. And what's important here is, is that people have to be proactive in beginning to order and stockpile these devices now, it cannot be waited until the last minute and expect that those products will be able to be manufactured because to your point, that scale can't be produced in that period of time. So we are seeing some governments around the world, we've gotten very large orders already beginning that stockpile to cover the citizens in their country of vaccines. Others haven't done that yet. And we've been really pretty much on a daily basis working with our public policy team to create greater awareness in governments of the need to start doing larger scale buys now. We have presented our production capabilities over the next a year. There are opportunities for us to invest further in capital, some of that we're doing proactively our self. But it needs to be done from a stockpiling perspective. And again, I think, there's further actions needed to do that. And again, we're working to help ensure that happens. That includes here in the U.S. Sure. Good, questions, Brian. Good morning. So yes, you heard right on Veritor that would be where we would be ramping up towards. We wouldn't have that available necessarily at launch. We will have that ramping up towards that way. We have plans and we'll share those plans from a timing perspective later on. From a performance perspective, again, we're in studies right now, so it's inappropriate to say what our performance is. We're getting actually that right now in clinical specimens, obviously we recognize the comparative to PCR is typical obviously for anything. We also recognize that these assays, they won't be as sensitive as PCR, no lateral flow assay is as sensitive as PCR, but no PCR assay is as ease of use, cost base, mobile as what you see in a platform like Veritor, which is why you see wide used applications in flu and strep testing still today. And it has a very important role. We see and we hear also from be it the FDA, the White House, other key constituents, our customers see a very important role in need for a lateral flow based COVID assay. We are focused on getting the COVID asset out first, Brian, the antigen test. And then to your point, can we add in a \u2013 combine that with our flu test in a single strip. Absolutely we've started to think about that. That of course becomes much simpler to do once you confirm that the COVID assay is secure done, we've launched that, then the ability to put that down with a flu test, both of which are now well characterized assays would be a next phase for us to think about. Yes, Brian, we don't share those at this point in time, obviously we're in \u2013 we're working very closely with the FDA in that response. We've actually already submitted our response plans on that. We've already started taking actions on many of those and we'll share more as we go forward. Yes, okay, thanks Brian. Rick good morning. And Rick, maybe we take advantage we've got. We do have Simon on the line. May be we turn over to Simon just for a quick comment on what you are seeing on the procedure side at a high level. And just to clarify, our reps will not be going in just to hospitals unless they are specifically requested to attend a case. And I think as we see that \u2013 while we're seeing that in some very small subsets that Simon just described, I'd say as we think about medical and life sciences, as Chris commented on not seeing that at any real difference at the end of April. For example, I can specimen collection or MDS, anything notable there difference. Hey Rick, great question. Absolutely. So near term over the last two months, we've actually \u2013 the work on the SKU rationalization has in fact accelerated to your point with folks at home, the ability to engage actually the sales team in working through products \u2013 the product list of what we're looking to remove from the portfolio, the substitute products actually been able to \u2013 number of teams have been able to engage them in a way which has been much more than we would have been able to do traditionally. Actually I think we had a number of businesses already starting that product simplification initiative. And that expanded pretty significantly across the company to other businesses during this window of time where the marketing teams, et cetera, were also had bandwidth to accelerate that work. So that's been one that we've taken advantage of this period to double down on. In terms of the manufacturing, network consolidation that does continue to move forward. We haven't been able to necessarily accelerate that during this period of time. Obviously manufacturing teams focus primarily on supply right now and navigating that. Of course you can imagine every day there's items that we have to manage in our supply chain, as well as in our own facilities. But that is fully still moving forward in all ways and we'll continue to keep you updated on that. Yes I'll start with that Robert, thanks for the question. And as you might imagine, the first thing that we wanted to make sure of is that we were able to mitigate the cash impact from the headwinds from COVID. And we've made great progress on that in a few short weeks. And we are able to mitigate a substantial part of the, what we see as the capital impact. And we think that was the prudent thing to do. Now, one of those things that we did to get there in addition to some of the P&L items that we talked about that clearly impact P&L and cash. But from a cash perspective one of the items that we did take down was the CapEx. And we're prioritizing mission critical capital spending, and we're cutting and basically delaying some of the investments that we're making that are more discretionary. And we're being very careful on that because we want to make sure that we're not cutting anything that would inhibit any capacity going forward So we're being very targeted on that and it clearly is not a permanent adjustment in CapEx. We would expect that when we come out of this pandemic that we would, some of those things that we're cutting, we will are just deferring and we'll have to spend that. And so you can expect us to go back to the normal $900,000 to $1 billion kind of thing. And that is particularly true as we think about investing in areas that are necessary for COVID. We continue to invest in those areas, and ramp and make sure that we have capacity as terms articulated on a number of fronts. We're ramping capacity. So think of that as a temporary reduction. Thanks for the question. Good question, Matt. So we don't share our specific shares on a global basis. We are, as we said, the leader in worldwide, we're clearly the leader in the U.S. And we make billions and billions of syringes and needles a year. We make billions and billions of them specifically just for the U.S. market as well each year. So to be able to provide it, let's just say in your example, a billion syringes spontaneously, there's not capacity to just provide those in a month. We have provided plans to different governments around the world where we can provide hundreds of millions of product and over months, periods of time. And there is opportunity to go above that, but it needs to be done in partnership with those governments. So again, some of those governments we've engaged have strongly engaged with us to do that. Others are still working through their plans. On that point, what's most important is you've got to get ahead of that and start to start to get those orders and things in now. The other thing is, it's just a little caveat there is the reason I hesitate is there is global capacity as well, there's certain products that we sell, for example, in the U.S. that we don't sell ex-U.S. and there's many products that we sell ex-U.S. that we don't sell in the U.S. So for example, we pretty much exclusively sell safety devices in the U.S. We have a lot of capacity of non-safety devices ex-U.S. In a pandemic vaccine delivery situation one may not prioritize the need for safety needles on the end of a vaccine delivery. And so you can free up additional capacity to come into the marketplace. But those, again that's working with the governments on the specific requirements. And the stockpiling, again, some governments have already started taking those actions aggressively, others we're really focused on getting them to act sooner. It's a good question. I honestly don't know the answer of that. That's something that I would imagine that that many hospitals are thinking about what it could be a second wave in the fall and next winter. And thinking about how they balance that, including some of these field hospitals that have been set up and how you think about those. In fairness, we haven't had deep discussions with our customers on the long-term implications of ICU beds and how they may or may not maintain that over a longer period of time. Certainly, particularly in the U.S., I think, that may be a little different in some areas like in Europe where you've seen countries, you've seen the stats of ICU beds per capita in different countries in Europe and how disparate those are. What we have heard were some of those countries that did not have as many ICU beds may want to permanently maintain a higher ratio of ICU beds. But I think that's on some that were well below benchmarking levels. Yes. Josh, we're not seeing widespread requests for that at this point in time. And I think the question would be would they be reallocating? Remember, overall hospital utilization in the U.S. is still relatively low rate, it's not 90% across the board in normal terms, so how much they would allocate to COVID-specific wards, et cetera. I think that's still being figured out. Obviously all hospitals were being dedicated to that at this point in time. We don't see \u2013 it's not visible today that there would be some type of spike in pump or Pyxis growth as people are trying to build a separate COVID systems from their main wards. But something we'll monitor but we're not seeing that today. Yes, we can't comment really with many details at this point in time. Obviously it includes a number of additional clinical data studies that were generated on BTK. And we submitted those various data sets to the FDA. So again, we believe that there remains a significant unmet need for that patient population that there's not strong alternatives for today. We strongly believe in the safety of the BTK product and it's under active review. So we'll continue to keep you updated as it progresses. But we've submitted the data that we believe isn't complete and so it's now under the review process. Thank you. Okay, well thanks everyone for the great discussion today. As I close today's call, I'm reminded of something a mentor of mine once shared, which is that crisis doesn't make character, it reveals character. And that's truly the way, I think, that we've seen BD respond here that the COVID-19 crisis has really revealed the best of BD reinforcing the commitment of our associates who never forget that there's a patient at the end of everything we do. It's revealed the breadth, the depth and necessity of our product portfolio reinforcing the central role we play from discovery and diagnosis to the delivery of care and treatment of disease and it's revealed our ability to adapt and innovate, mustering our resources to bring new solutions to help solve healthcare's biggest problems. That track record is why healthcare providers and health officials worldwide have put their trust in us during the most significant health crisis in the past century. And it's what gives us the confidence that we will continue to drive growth, innovation, and value creation in the many categories we serve long after COVID-19 has been contained. I think it's fair to say that the road to recovery for the healthcare industry and global economy is going to take some time. It's likely to have its own bumps, but I'm confident BD will navigate these near term challenges, take the necessary actions and execute our strategy to emerge strong. I've been so inspired by the response of BD associates. We have an incredibly dedicated and committed team. And I can't thank the team enough for going above and beyond in these challenging times. I want to thank all of you for your time today. Stay well."

            "name": "Chris Reidy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my comments by addressing BD's response for the COVID-19 pandemic. First, as the coronavirus emerged, I was very proud to see the response and collaboration across our team and the immediate focus on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our BD associates around the world. Also vital to our crisis response was our focus on taking care of our customers and the communities we serve. Beyond the actions we took at a company level, I've been truly amazed by the reaction from our associates, from our frontline to our back office staff and everywhere in between our associates that put the wellbeing of our customers and our communities above their own personal priorities. Second, from a cash perspective, we took early and prudent actions to protect our business during the time when liquidity is paramount. And lastly, as we contemplated these actions, we did so with the continued focus on our long-term strategy. We're confident that BD will emerge from this global health crisis from a position of strength and will continue to create and deliver value to all stakeholders. With that context, let's move on to our results for the second quarter, including a review of the COVID-19 impacts. As Tom mentioned earlier, performance in the second quarter was ahead of our prior expectations. Revenues grew 2.4% on a currency neutral basis, despite a larger than anticipated impact from COVID. As you're well aware, the virus worsened significantly in China during February and subsequently spread beyond China's borders quickly becoming a global pandemic by mid-March. I'll provide more color on second quarter revenue growth and the impact from COVID in a moment when I take you through the results by segment. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.55, which represents a decline of 1.5% year-over-year or 1.9% on a currency neutral basis. EPS performance was above the high end of our guidance range due to revenue over performance and lower operating expenses as well as a small benefit related to foreign currency. As expected, the expiration of the Gore royalty impacted adjusted EPS growth by about 600 basis points. Operating margin of 24.7%, we're also ahead of our expectations for the quarter, largely driven by lower deferred compensation expense due to weak stock market performance in the quarter and lower operating expenses.  Turning to Slide 16, I'll provide an update on cash and liquidity and the early improvement actions we took during the quarter to reinforce our strong liquidity position. In March, we successfully completed $1.9 billion of term loan funding at very favorable rates. This resulted in an increase in our gross leverage to 3.9 times at March 31. During the second quarter, we also increased capacity available under our revolver by $381 million to $2.63 billion to further strengthen our liquidity position. It's also important to note that we remain committed to achieving our below three times gross leverage target, continuing to delever remains a very important commitment to the company and we currently plan to pay down approximately $1 billion in debt in FY 2020. However, due to the near-term anticipated pressure on EBITDA and given our current focus on cash conservation and the importance of liquidity, we now expect it will take longer to reach out deleverage target. In addition to our treasury related actions, we have instituted a number of cash conservation measures. This includes lowering capital expenditures as well as working capital initiatives with a focus on inventory management. From an operation standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, our employees are going above and beyond to serve our customers in their patients and this includes keeping our plants operational. Manufacturing teams are ramping up much needed products and we're making additional investments as a result of the increased demand we are seeing in some of our businesses due to COVID-19. In other areas where scaling back and have made the difficult decision to temporarily furlough some employees as we manage inventories and adjust in near-term demand levels. In addition to the temporary furloughs, we felt it was important and consistent with our values to share the impact across our global team. So we've taken actions more broadly across the company to reduce salaries at the management and Board levels and also for senior leaders. The executive team and Board took the largest percent reduction. The decision was also made to suspend the company match for the 401(k) and other benefit plans for the remainder of the calendar year and to limit hiring to critical positions. While difficult, the actions we are taking today will reinforce our financial strength as we emerge on the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Now moving on to Slide 17, before I discuss our revenue performance by segment, I'd like to take you through the COVID impact in the quarter. All in, we estimate that COVID reduced revenue growth by approximately 140 basis points in the second quarter. This is about double the impact we had estimated at the time of our last earnings call, which was prior to the escalation of the virus in China and the global spread of COVID during the last two weeks of March. As you would expect, the majority of the COVID headwind in the second quarter was in China. This was driven by strict adherence to stay at home measures which resulted in lower hospital utilization and a decline in elective procedures as well as fewer routine lab tests and related specimen collections. In addition, there was reduced demand from research labs due to closures amid the stay-at-home measures. Within the U.S. and Europe, there was a net tailwind from COVID in the second quarter. This was driven by increased demand for critical healthcare devices during the pandemic. We also saw the initial use of BD MAX for COVID testing. While demand increased in the acute care setting, this was partially offset by a decline in the non-acute area as people generally stopped seeking care outside of treatment related to the virus.  Turning to Slide 18 and the Medical segment, BD Medical revenues in the second quarter declined slightly compared to the prior year, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 40 basis points, but then the medication delivery solutions unit as anticipated, our performance reflects distributor inventory reductions related to the ongoing volume-based procurement process in China which were in line with our expectations. Outside of China, we saw strong growth in our vascular access management portfolio of solutions. With respect to COVID, the most notable headwind in the quarter was in China and was driven by significant declines in hospital utilization. In the U.S., COVID was a net tailwind that was driven by surge demand and distributor stocking partially offset by the impacts from lower routine and elective procedures and acute care and lower utilization in the non-acute setting. We also experienced COVID-driven surge demand in Europe in the second quarter. Revenues in the medication management solutions unit reflect limited installations of Alaris pumps as anticipated. Within the quarter, Alaris sales on the medical necessity approval were approximately $10 million. Alaris pending order volume on the medical necessity was high at the end of March. However, these orders were not filled before the quarter end. As a result, the revenues associated with those orders were recorded in April. We currently anticipate demand for Alaris pumps on the medical necessity will continue in the third quarter as hospitals respond to the COVID situation, albeit to a lesser extent than April as we expect demand to follow the evolution of the virus curve. In Pharmaceutical Systems, growth of over 11% reflects our continued ability to meet high demand for prefilled syringes and it was also aided by the timing of shipments. Within our diabetes care business, we saw an increase in sales of insulin pen needles and syringes as distributors and retailers increase their inventories on hand as a result of the COVID pandemic. Diabetes Care performance also reflects a tough comparison. The timing of what is that drove a strong Q2 last year. Turning to Slide 19 in the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues increased 7.1% in the second quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 120 basis points. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostic systems and pre-analytical systems units. Growth in diagnostic systems was driven primarily by a point-of-care BD Veritor flu assay and our swab collection and transport systems. This was due to a stronger flu season in comparison to the prior year and was aided in March by COVID-19. We also continue to see strong growth of our BD MAX instruments and assays for routine testing as well as an increased demand globally for using COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by a decline in routine testing and our microbiology and women's health and cancer products due to the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in China. Performance and pre-analytical systems reflect solid growth in wingsets in develop markets as well as favorable comparison due to distributor ordering patterns in the prior year. Within Europe, we saw some stocking of specimen collection devices related to COVID. This was partially offset by a decline in routine specimen collections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in China. Performance in the Biosciences unit reflects a tough comparison to the prior year, driven by the timing of licensing revenues and tenders in emerging markets. Results in the Biosciences unit also reflect reduced demand for instruments and reagents as research lab activity slowed significantly through the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as well as in China. Turning to Slide 20 and the BD Interventional segment, revenues increased 3.3% in the second quarter, including a net headwind from COVID of approximately 350 basis points. Excluding the impact of COVID on elective procedures, revenue growth and peripheral intervention was broad-based, including continued strong performance in our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products. Additionally, there was an improvement in the year-over-year decline in DCB related revenues driven by continued commercialization of DCBs in Japan and sales related to two new product launches in the U.S. Within PI, the decline in elective procedures in China resulted in reduced demand across our portfolio. Revenues in the surgery unit were broadly impacted by the global slowdown in elective procedures due to COVID, particularly related to hernia repair across the U.S., Europe and China as well as biosurgery in China. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, growth was strong in both hernia and infection prevention. Revenue growth in urology and critical care continue to be driven by performance and targeted temperature management, home care and PureWick. I'll now turn to Slide 21 in our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter. As you've already heard from some of our peers in MedTech, COVID will put pressures on margins in the near-term given the high fixed cost nature of our business. In addition, we'll see an impact from the lost revenues carrying your gross margin rate that is higher than the company average. We expect this pressure on margins to improve as the revenues return. In this quarter, gross profit margin of 54.7%, declined 110 basis points on a performance basis. We had anticipated a year-over-year decline in gross margins due to the impact from lower Alaris sales and volume based procurement in China, particularly partially offset by our continuous improvement and synergy and initiatives. Due to a larger than anticipated impact to revenues from COVID and the related impact to mix, gross margin came in slightly below our expectations. Currency had a positive impact of 50 basis points on gross margin in the quarter. Operating margin of 24.7%, increased 110 basis points in the quarter or 70 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This was driven by lower deferred compensation expense recorded with an SSG&A that is offset in the P&L and the other income net line item. Excluding the 110 basis point benefit from deferred compensation, operating margins decreased 40 basis points currency neutral. Unfavorable gross margin performance was partially offset by lower ongoing initiatives to reduce expenses, particularly within G&A. Currency had a positive impact of 40 basis points in operating margin in the quarter. Now turning to Slide 22 which recaps the second quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 2.4%. This includes 10 basis points of positive pricing in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect pricing to decline approximately 40 basis points versus our previous estimate of 50 basis points to 60 basis points. Gross margin was 54.7% as I discussed a moment ago. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.2% including the benefit from deferred compensation. On an underlying basis, excluding deferred comp SSG&A expenses grew at a rate below sales and reflect our ongoing focus on discipline spending and the achievement of Bard cost synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.8% as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth, despite COVID-19 pressures. Our tax rate was 16% in the quarter in line with our expectations and our full year guidance range of 14% to 16%. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter and as a reminder, the preferred shares converted on May 1. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.55 as previously discussed. In these uncertain times, we believe it's critical to maintain our unwavering commitment to transparency and to share with all of our stakeholders the anticipated financial effects of COVID-19 on our business to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, despite having April results, as we navigate these unprecedented times, there are still too many variables to guide the fiscal year or even the third quarter. As we look forward, we are considering the following macroeconomic factors. First we're in the early stages of recovery and there's still great uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the pandemic. Key to the recovery and the impact to BD is the return of general healthcare utilization. While we have begun to see some improvement in China as they are earlier in the recovery phase, the U.S. and Europe are lagging and this can be seen in our April results, which I'll speak to in just a moment. Second, we are clearly operating in a much weaker macroeconomic environment and as you know, a weaker environment generally puts pressure on the overall healthcare system utilization and consumer spending. And finally, the pace at which deferred procedures return to normal is the biggest variable. This will depend on several factors including disease condition and acuity, COVID-19 testing availability, reopening of countries around the world and state by state within the U.S. and patient willingness to seek care. It's too early to call how that will all play out. And that brings me to the bottom of this slide. As we move forward, we expect to see the biggest unfavorable impact of COVID-19 in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses because surgeries or other procedures in which our products are used are being deferred. We cannot anticipate the pace at which those procedures will return and how our customers will manage pent-up demand. Moving on to the acute and non-acute area where our MMS, MDS and UCC businesses participate. We see some pluses and minuses. We expect these dynamics to shift going forward and I'll provide more details on the next slide. In diagnostics, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see strong growth of our BD MAX instruments and assays for use in COVID-19 testing. In addition, we had good traction with our serology test in April and as Tom mentioned, we're currently validating performance of an enhanced version of the kit. Additionally, we currently have point-of-care test for coronavirus in development leveraging the BD Veritor system. The team is working 24/7 to get this test to market as early as possible, but as Tom mentioned, we could still face some unforeseeable issues during the clinical evaluation phase. As a result, it's too early to talk about a specific timeline for this potential product and what the market opportunity may be, but it could be a meaningful driver of growth. And lastly, in our Biosciences business, our recovery will largely depend on when research labs and institutions reopened and how quickly these scale up to normal operations and resume capital spending. We have also seen some impact on clinical flow applications like leukemia and lymphoma testing because hospitals are focused on COVID-19. On the positive side, there is potential for a modest benefit should NIH or other COVID-19 stimulus programs receive funding. Now moving on to Slide 24. This is a view into what we saw in the month of April, which includes our preliminary sales results. Going forward, our Surgery and PI businesses will continue to see significant pressure as a result of elective procedure deferrals. In the month of April the decline and procedures impacted Surgery revenues by 50% to 70% and Interventional revenues by 30% to 40%. In China, Surgery revenues are still approximately 50% of pre-COVID expectation and across the U.S. and Europe, Surgical and Interventional revenues are down 60% to 90%. In terms of loss revenues, we saw a decline of approximately $60 million in our Surgery business and $50 million in Peripheral Intervention. Moving on to MMS, we saw increased demand for infusion pumps under medical necessity, which we do not expect to continue at the same pace moving forward. This was partially offset by continued delays in Pyxis and [indiscernible] installations, which we do expect to continue going forward. This resulted in a net tailwind to MMS of approximately $70 million. In our MDS business in the United States, we continue to see reduced demand in our acute and non-acute businesses due to continued softness and routine and elective procedures. Within the month of March, these negative impacts were offset by tailwind from COVID-related surge demand and distributed stocking. Conversely, in April as the virus curve began to flatten, the COVID search demand began to abate and the distributors acted accordingly. As a result in April, we saw revenue in the U.S. that was approximately 15% to 20% below pre-COVID expectations. In China while hospital volumes in April broadly returned as isolation restrictions have been lifted, revenues was still approximately 30% to 40% below pre-COVID expectations. And lastly in Europe we saw the continuation of some COVID surge demand with revenues approximately 5% above our pre-COVID expectations. Combined, we started the decline of approximately $50 million in April in MDS largely driven by lower volumes in China and the U.S. Correspondingly in UCC, we saw a decline of approximately $20 million related to Foley catheter demand in April. Moving on to diagnostics and pre-analytical systems continues lower routine testing volumes resulted in fewer specimen collections and lower non-COVID diagnostic testing. Conversely, demand for COVID related testing remained high. In terms of revenues, we saw a decline of approximately $40 million for the month of April. In addition, we expect more meaningful delays in large capital installations such as Kiestra as we move forward. And lastly in our Biosciences business, we saw a decline of approximately $20 million in April due to lab closures. We expect a continued negative impact on capital spending related to ongoing reduced research activity. If we aggregate the pluses and minuses across the portfolio, we estimate that COVID-19 had a negative impact of approximately $240 million in the month of April. And this impact was partially offset by a tailwind of approximately $70 million related to increased demand for Alaris Pump under medical necessarily in MMS that we do not anticipate will continue at the same pace moving beyond April. I would also like to remind you once again of my earlier comment regarding the pressure on margins due to the high fixed cost in our operations and lower sales on high margin products. We hope this level of transparency is helpful as you think about the diversity and enduring nature of the BD portfolio. And as you can see there are a number of variables which make it very difficult to provide guidance as the COVID-19 situation continues to progress and we get more clarity around each of these variables, we'll keep you informed. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to summarize the key messages from our presentation today. As the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, we are uniquely positioned to respond by leveraging our core capabilities and expertise to deliver solutions across the full continuum of care from research, to diagnosis and surveillance, to medication management, delivery and critical care. Our second quarter results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio despite the increased impact from COVID-19. Going forward, we have put initiatives in place to actively manage our business as we navigate the negative near term impact of the virus. Importantly, these measures include the actions we took to reinforce our strong cash and liquidity position. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value for all stakeholders and emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Thanks for that. Now like to open the call up to Q&A. Hey Kristen are you there? That's exactly right. So, I guess the way to think about this is, in the second quarter we had $10 million of medical necessity that really wasn't COVID-related, that was kind of normal medical necessity that we would have expected when we gave guidance last quarter. We had something similar to that in the month of April as well. But above and beyond that, we had a spike in medical necessity for Alaris Pumps as you might imagine in the peak of the fight against the pandemic. And so that spiked, we did have a bit of offset from the Pyxis installations and Rowa installations, et cetera, but the bulk of that was the spike in the Alaris. Now, as we look going forward, we would expect that spike to abate somewhat. Not completely, but we would expect it to abate in May and in June and not be at the same levels as it was in April. We would also expect to see a little bit of a spike in the deferral of Pyxis and Rowa installations and keep that \u2013 that would keep going. So that would offset. So as you think about the next few months, we just wanted to make sure people were clear that we would expect that $70 million to come down in May and June. Good morning David. There seems to be a pause David? There you are. Yes we can. Yes we can. And just to be clear on your first question, Bob, when you adjust for that $70 million it comes out to low double digits impact on a year-over-year basis. Okay. Thanks, Larry it's a good question. And the way to think about it is a lot of what's being negatively impacting the business such as a surgery and PI we're fortunate to have very high gross margin profiles. So, think in the 70 plus kind of range. In addition to that, as you think about the impact you've got to consider manufacturing variances which are going to impact the P&L as we adjust for the revenue and adjust our inventories accordingly which is the right thing to do. So, as we think about it, we're also making investments in COVID-related ramping as we've talked about on the call here. So we're making those investments. We're also investing in the safety and health of our associates making our own PPNE which we talked about, facilities cleaning and those kinds of things. So those are additional costs. And then we're also seeing higher shipping costs as you are probably not surprised by. So when you take that and then we're taking \u2013 offsetting that we've taken cost mitigating actions that we talked about in our remarks. We limited travel and hiring freeze early in the second quarter and we saw the benefits of that. But we've also taken salary deductions for management and the Board, the 401k match, so that offsets things. So when you net all of that out, you should be thinking about the margin impact of the lost revenues going forward in that 75% kind of range when you net everything together. So hopefully that gives you some more color. So we've been \u2013 of course in our strategy, we've been very specifically developing additional solutions for the nonacute sector, be it our Rowa platform for retail pharmacy, our Veritor platform or even commercial teams that we've put in place, bringing our medication management solutions and including catheters, et cetera, into the surgery centers and non-acute. So we've been shifting our resources in that direction. It's been a faster growing segment, but we'll certainly only increase in that direction going forward. I think you heard some of the announcements that we talked about today on our new product development platforms like the acquisition of Nat DX, which will give us a point-of-care molecular platform, to supplement, right? So Veritor will be a lateral flow based. This platform will be molecular based similar time to resolve we would expect as Veritor. Again, that's an investment that we're making, seeing that we expect diagnostics will continue to shift in that direction. We're making other investments even in our PAS business that allow self blood collection and other types of sample collection that are much more appropriate for the retail setting, et cetera. So we definitely see it a trend. It's something we've been investing in and will only continue to double down on that as we go forward. Yes, so it's really hard to predict. There wasn't enough in the last week of April differential to really give us a sense of that. And when you think about it's really elective procedures. So we didn't see enough of a change in the elective procedures to be able to call May and to get any sense of anything changing. To your point around what might be up and down, we think that the lab closures, the impact in May might get a little bit worse and capital spending levels over the next couple of months would also be something that could get a little worse. And so it's just there's so many variables, it's what makes May and June, very, very hard to predict. And, I think we'll learn more as time goes on as you said, but there was nothing about the last week of April, that would give us a sense of where this is going. It's just too early to tell at this point. Thanks everyone."

They are also England, in particular, is very much outpatient based. So, they get the patients in, they treat them, they get reimbursed nicely and the patients go home. So that's been \u2013 that has picked up nicely at the back end of April. And also another point worth noting is something hit the back end of April, our salesforce began to receive more calls from their customers about beginning to re-attend cases. So, Tom said, we're about to let those at those guys loose here again in the in the middle of the month. And in fact just yesterday we began as shipping them all their PPE so that they can attend cases and go back into hospitals where they're allowed. So there are several things in certain pockets that are pointing in the right direction in respect to some aspects of our elective business."

It will be available for replay through February 13, 2020, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 6886458.  I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.\nMonique Dolecki: Thank you, Pasha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Our first quarter results include a charge of $59 million related to a voluntary recall in the MMS infusion business to address certain software and alarm prioritization matters. This item along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website. Leading the call this morning is Tom Polen, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thank you, Monique. And good morning, everyone. You saw in our earnings release this morning where we brought down revenue and EPS guidance for the year, and let me just say that resetting expectations is certainly not how I want to start my first call as CEO.  And so, before we jump into what's happening with Alaris, I want to say that how we're going to discuss topics on today's call is what you can expect from me \u2013 straight talk, accountability, and an unwavering commitment to quality and regulatory compliance, our values and doing what's right. At our core, BD is a very purpose-driven company. It's what defines who we are, how we operate, and what actions we take. And you can expect that our purpose and values will be at the heart of how we respond to the current situation with Alaris. Every company is going to face challenges, and the real measure of the company\u2019s strength isn't whether or not we face challenges, it's how we respond. And I'm personally focused, along with my entire leadership team, on fully resolving this situation. So, let me take you through what happened starting with what we said in November and even more recently and how our conversations with the FDA have continued to evolve, even specifically this week. In November, we told you we were planning to make some improvements to our Alaris pump software, including upgrades to alarm prioritization and optimization. We indicated then that we were in active discussions with the FDA about the timing and implementation of these improvements. Relying on our quality process within the infusion business and how we've managed Alaris software updates over time, the team believed we could take a phased approach to releasing Alaris software updates and that these releases did not require a 510(k) clearance. We then issued the first phase of our software updates in December, and we resumed shipping as we shared with you last month.  Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, including an in-depth discussion this past Monday, we learned that the FDA disagreed with our conclusion about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for these software upgrades.  And in light of the consent decree, the FDA has requested that we combine all Alaris software enhancements, recall remediation updates, and changes made to the Alaris system over time into a single comprehensive 510(k) filing, which we're going to submit in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. We're actively continuing to collaborate with the FDA to ensure we meet their expectations for this upcoming regulatory submission.  I want to be clear here that while we relied on our infusion quality process and system, we've now learned that in this case it did not meet FDA's expectations, and we're committed to taking the appropriate actions to get this right. I also want to be clear that we fully stand behind the safety and the clinical benefits of our product, which is used in the care of 70% of patients undergoing infusion therapy, and that's a responsibility we do not take lightly. We've provided guidance to our customers on how to mitigate potential risks until our software is fully remediated. We've also created a dedicated team of clinical consultants to support live training for healthcare providers, and we will continue to support existing customers to ensure they have access to the Alaris system under medical necessity. As CEO, my foremost focus is on ensuring the right supporting processes, capabilities, and execution within the company to ensure we deliver on FDA expectations. Chris will discuss this more, but as you saw in our news release, based on this situation, we reduced our guidance range by approximately $400 million in revenue and $0.60 in EPS for fiscal year 2020. I also want to comment on China's volume-based procurement initiatives and which we've shared would be impacting our MDS catheter business and that we now have a much better sense of how the situation is evolving than we did last month. So, while it's progressing faster than we initially forecasted in November, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. We've got several upsides from the rest of our business in China, which are expected to grow double digits during the year, and there are also a few other areas that we're doing better than expected in so far, including flu testing, DCBs, and FX. We are a strong company with a diverse portfolio, both in terms of our products and our geographies, and there's a lot of good things happening across BD. And I want to highlight just a few. First, our Q1 results were in line with the expectations we shared with you in November. The businesses and the regions delivered solid performance, led by Life Sciences where we saw an incremental benefit from the flu and our Interventional segment where we saw growth from new products and DCBs also started a bit better than expected. During the quarter, we continued to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration. We remain on track to deliver $100 million in cost synergies this year, which brings our total to $300 million over the three-year deal period. We also continue to scale our commercial programs as part of our commitment to achieve $250 million in revenue synergies by 2022.  We've continued to make good progress there with things we've talked to you about in the past, such as the European biosurgery incubator, vascular access management, and our international product registrations. Another strength in FY 2020 is our ability to deliver on a robust pipeline of new products, and we're already off to a solid cadence with 11 new launches so far in Q1.  And there's three I'd like to just call your attention to. In Medical, we're continuing to innovate in our vascular access portfolio. And we recently launched the new PowerPICC Provena catheter with SOLO 2 valve technology, which makes the catheter easier to care for. Our early feedback from customers is extremely positive. In Life Sciences, we recently introduced the BD COR molecular system that's targeted in Europe. This flagship innovation completely automates the molecular laboratory workflow, and our initial system configuration is available with the BD Onclarity HPV assay, which is used for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. We're still very early in this launch, but we feel really good about the progress we've made so far, having already signed 10 high-value volume accounts in Q1. Of course, we're new to the HPV market, and so all of that is new business for BD. In Interventional, we received clearance for EleVation, our next-generation vacuum assisted breast biopsy device, which helps ensure tissue samples, high-quality tissue samples regardless of the density of the breast tissue. It's early, but we're getting very positive clinical feedback here as well. We're excited by these and our other launches and our long-term innovation pipeline.  What you see on slide five captures our major launches for FY 2020, but it's only a small portion of the total active R&D projects that we expect to bring to market over the next three to five years. We're also entering several new higher growth market spaces with our overall R&D pipeline focused in markets growing 1% to 2% faster than our existing product portfolio. And we see elements of our automation and informatics capabilities in the pipeline across each of our three segments, including now in Interventional where we're starting to leverage BD's capabilities to digitize the legacy Bard portfolio. Before I turn things over to Chris, I want to make some comments on the coronavirus. First, as it comes to the coronavirus, the health and the safety of employees in China and around the world is our top priority.  We're closely tracking the virus in China and we're paying particular attention to the guidance from the US CDC, the WHO and health officials in China.  As you'd expect from us, we're also supporting response efforts in China by providing in-kind and monetary donations to the Wuhan Red Cross and Project Hope. BD doesn't manufacture \u2013 we don't have any manufacturing or distribution operations in the Wuhan or Hubei province and we are adhering to the guidance from the Chinese government and extending the Chinese New Year holiday until February 10 at our offices and facilities in Suzhou and Shanghai. From a supply chain perspective, about 95% of the products we manufacture in China are sold and used within China. We currently have sufficient inventory of the few products that we export from China to meet current demand. And within China, imports of goods and raw materials are being received as expected. In terms of business impact, of course, the situation is still very dynamic. We are closely watching and balancing two trends. First, we are seeing fewer people go to the hospital to seek standard care. At the same time, we have received and installed several urgent orders for additional BD MAX molecular systems, which are being used in coronavirus testing. Chris will take you through how we're contemplating this within our guidance. We'll continue to closely monitor the situation and keep you updated as it evolves. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Reidy : Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Before I take you through our first quarter results and guidance for the full year, I'd like to reinforce Tom's remarks on the Alaris pump issue. As you would expect from us, we take this matter very seriously. We did not anticipate the current Alaris pump situation to materialize the way that it has and I assure you that the senior management team is fully committed to resolving the situation. So with that, let me review our first quarter results. As Tom mentioned, we delivered solid performance in the first quarter. First quarter revenues grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. I'll provide more color on the first quarter revenue growth in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.65, which is at the high-end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS declined about 2% year-over-year and was about flat on a currency neutral basis. As expected, adjusted EPS growth reflects solid operating performance, offset by the expiration of the Gore royalty and a very tough compare to last year's first quarter tax rate of 11.2%. Operating margins of 24% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also continued to de-lever during the first quarter, paying down approximately $90 million of debt. At December 31, our gross leverage ratio was 3.5 times and we remain on track to achieve our commitment to de-lever to below 3 times this calendar year. Moving on to slide 10, I'll review the medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical revenues declined 1.1% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. As expected, first quarter performance in the Medical segment was impacted by the new volume-based procurement process being adopted in certain Chinese provinces, which is specific to our catheter business within our medication delivery solutions portfolio of China. Outside of China, we saw strong growth in our vascular access management portfolio of solutions. In addition, as anticipated, revenues in medication management solutions declined due to limited installations of Alaris pumps. In pharmaceutical systems, strength of over 9% reflects our ability to meet high demand for prefillable syringes as a result of our ongoing investments in capacity as conversion from vials to prefillable devices continues. As expected, diabetes care revenues were about flat compared to the prior year, driven by anticipated pricing pressure in the US and the timing of orders that drove the strong Q4 last year as discussed on our previous earnings call. Now, turning to slide 11 and the BD Life Sciences segment, revenues increased 7.4% in the first quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostic systems and biosciences units.  Growth in diagnostic systems was brought based across point-of-care, flu, our molecular diagnostic platforms and our microbiology solutions, as well as our woman's health and cancer portfolio. With continue to see over 20% growth in BD MAX and are receiving very positive feedback on our BD COR launch in Europe.  Very strong growth in biosciences was driven by licensing revenues and demand for instruments and reagents. This was partially offset by a tough comparison due to the divestiture of the advanced bioprocessing product line during last year's first fiscal quarter. Growth in pre-analytical systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year when revenues grew 7.6%, driven by additional capacity brought on to meet demand for our pushbutton blood collection sets and the timing of distributor orders. Now, turning to slide 12 and the BD Interventional segment, revenues increased 5% in the first quarter, with mid-single-digit growth across all three business units.  Revenue growth in peripheral intervention was broad-based, including performance in our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products that continue to perform extremely well.  DCB-related revenues was slightly better than planned as the trend we have been seeing since the FDA letter has improved. Excluding the DCB impact, revenues in peripheral intervention grew over 8%. First quarter revenue growth in surgery reflects strong double-digit performance in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in hernia. We saw robust growth across the US, Europe and China. As you may recall, we relaunched Progel last year and are now approaching our historical run rate in sales. Revenue growth in urology and critical care continues to be driven by performance across our acute urology, home care and targeted temperature management business.  Moving to slide 13 and our geographic revenues, developed markets grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in the US in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments was partially offset by a decline in the Medical segment as anticipated due to the infusion pump software upgrade, as previously discussed. We also spoke saw strong performance in Europe in vascular care within MDS. Molecular diagnostics, lab automation in women's health and cancer and diagnostic systems and hernia and biosurgery within the surgery unit. Emerging markets revenues grew 5.1% for the first quarter. Performance was driven by nearly double-digit growth in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. China revenues reflect strong double-digit growth in Life Sciences and Interventional segments as anticipated. The Medical segment's performance in China was also in line with our expectations as strong double-digit growth across MMS, diabetes care and pharmaceutical systems was offset by the impact of volume-based procurement related to peripheral catheters in MDS. As we started the new fiscal year, the situation in China remained fluid. When we provided guidance in November, we told you about a new volume-based procurement process that several provinces had adopted, which was modeled after similar initiatives for generic drugs and other spending categories. While the program covers a wide variety of consumable medical products for BD, it's focus on our $200 million peripheral catheter portfolio within our MDS business. While we anticipated that it would expand, we have now seen volume-based procurement expand at a faster rate. In addition, we are seeing distributors reduce inventory levels in large part due to, and in anticipation of, this new procurement process and we are assuming that will continue. As Tom said, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. However, as a result of these dynamics, we now expect low-single-digit growth in China for the full fiscal year. Excluding the MDS portfolio, we are seeing high double-digit growth in China and are pleased with our performance in that region. Now, turning to slide 14 which recaps the first quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 2.5%. This includes 80 basis points of pricing pressure, which is in line with our expectations as we had anticipated pricing would be most acute in the first quarter as certain prior-year pricing agreements annualize. For the full fiscal year, we expect pricing to decline approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points. Moving down the P&L, gross profit grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Gross margin was a solid 56.5%. SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 26.5%. This reflects additional deferred compensation expense due to strong stock market performance in the quarter. For your reference, deferred compensation expense is fully offset in the other income net line. On an underlying basis, SSG&A expenses grew in line with sales and reflect our ongoing focus on disciplined spending and the achievement of Bard cost synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6%. For the full fiscal year, we expect to invest $1 billion in R&D which reflects our continued commitment to drive innovation.  As a result, operating margins decreased 50 basis points or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis which is in line with our expectations. Our tax rate was 15.3% in the quarter, in line with our full-year guidance range of 14% to 16%. And as expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the preferred shares will convert in May of this year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.65 as previously discussed. Now, turning to slide 15 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. Gross profit margin of 56.5% improved 30 basis points on a performance basis. This reflects our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies, partially offset by the impact of pricing. Operating margin of 24% declined 50 basis points in the quarter or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis. As previously discussed, this was driven by higher deferred compensation expense recorded within SSG&A that is offset below operating income in the other income net line item. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation, operating margins would have increased 40 basis points currency neutral. Currency had a negative impact of 10 basis points on both gross and operating margins in the quarter. Now, moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2020 revenue and P&L guidance. As you've already heard from Tom, we are revising our revenue growth guidance to 2.5% to 3.5%, specifically due to the Alaris situation. Our updated range reflects several scenarios based on our ongoing conversations with the FDA, with the bottom end of our range assuming a very limited ability to ship Alaris pumps this fiscal year. By segment, for the full year, we now expect BD Medical revenue growth to be about flat. We expect both BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional revenue growth be at the high-end of our previous guidance ranges of 6% to 7% and 5% to 6% respectively. We now anticipate low single-digit growth in developed markets in fiscal 2020. In emerging markets, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, driven by a diversified base of low single-digit growth in China, as previously discussed, and strengthen in EMA.  Based on our new guidance for FY 2020, we now expect revenue growth in the second quarter to be approximately 2% and EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.50. This includes an approximately $20 million to $30 million headwind from coronavirus within the quarter. This impact is contemplated within our full-year guidance range. Moving down the P&L, we have updated our gross profit margin, SSG&A and operating margin guidance to reflect the infusion pump impact. Our updated SSG&A and operating margin guidance ranges also include the first quarter impact of deferred compensation. For the full fiscal year, we now expect gross margin to be about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range and operating margin to improve approximately 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis. The balance of our P&L guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2020 remain unchanged. Moving on to slide 17, this reflects our revised EPS guidance for the total year. As you can see, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $11.90 to $12.10, which reflects our latest view on FX and the impact of Alaris pumps. In summary, we delivered a solid first quarter, in line with our expectation. We continue to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration and on bringing to market our robust innovation pipeline, launching 11 new products during the quarter.  Moving to the balance of the year, we take the news we delivered today very seriously and we are fully committed to resolving the Alaris situation and returning to our long-standing track record of delivering value to customers, their patients and shareholders.  Thanks. And I'd like to now open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could just start with the pump impact, and help us understand of the $400 million plus or minus that you lowered guidance by, how much exactly is for the pump? Will this linger into fiscal 2021?  I'll just ask all my questions here. Maybe as you walk us down through the P&L, it seems like there is a 40% contribution margin hit from that $400 million to the $0.60. Help us get to that number.\nTom Polen: Hey, Robbie, this is Tom. I'll take the first two questions and then turn it to Chris for your last one. So, of the $400 million, that is essentially pump capital that we're unable to ship. Of course, we have a very large install base in the field. We aren't expecting any meaningful impact on our consumable business there. We actually have seen some increase in consumable demand certainly because of the flu season. And as we mentioned, we stand very strongly behind the quality of the products and its continued usage in delivering 70% of infusions, particularly in the US. Lingering into 2021, what I could say at this point is, look, we know what we need to do to address this situation, and that's to submit the updated 510(k) within Q4, as I shared. So, that's what we're focused on right now. The timing in which we're going to get \u2013 we're working collaboratively with the FDA, and I'd say we'll give you updates as that progresses in terms of our ability to open up and resume shipping. So, as we continue that collaboration with the FDA, we'll have more visibility and we'll keep you updated.\nChristopher Reidy: I would just add to provide clarity to the guidance change. Up until the infusion pump issue this week in our meeting with the FDA this week, we were fully planning to reaffirm our guidance for fiscal year 2020. The 2.5% to 3.5% revenue growth guidance assumes essentially, on the low-end, that we sell virtually no pumps. And of our 450-ish kind of US infusion pump business, the range above that would expect the normal range of guidance that we would've had prior to this issue as well as the potential of selling some pumps under medical necessity. \nRobbie Marcus: And so, maybe just quickly, what's the breakdown of how much you're lowering for pump versus coronavirus and for the increased reimbursement?\nChristopher Reidy: So, what I would say is, it's 100% pumps because as you think about the puts and takes that we had this year, we are seeing upside on the flu side. We're seeing better performance in DCBs as we talked about. So, we have some strong performance in the rest of the business. China, outside of the value-based \u2013 volume-based procurement is doing extremely well, strong double digits across Interventional and Life Sciences. So, we had some upside. We did take into consideration the acceleration of the volume-based procurement. That stepped up. Just to kind of give you a sense, that's $200 million peripheral catheter business for us. Last quarter, we took it down by about $40 million. We've accelerated that by about $60 million, partly because of accelerations in the province tenders that we are seeing, but even more dramatically, the distributors taking down inventories in anticipation of these tenders. And so, that's an additional $60 million. So, we've taken down an additional $60 million. So, that takes us down to about $100 million left in that business going forward. That $60 million, plus the coronavirus of about $20 million to $30 million, we're offsetting with the strong performance, as I talked about, in other parts of the business.  So as I said, going into this week, we had all of that in the mix and would have still reaffirmed our guidance for the year. So, you can think about the takedown as entirely the Alaris pump issue.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start initially, Tom, if you go back historically and look at the Baxter Colleague recall, that share loss built, Tom, over a series of years. So, do you have any early comments on what can be done to support customers and incentivizing them to wait for resolution? Or how customers are going to evaluate this, buy from another provider or wait decision during this interim ship-hold period?\nTom Polen: Hey, David. So, what I would say is, of course, customers have been increasingly selecting the Alaris product, as you know, for many years and we've seen that in continued share gains in the category. I would say, going into FY 2020 this year, we've had really \u2013 that momentum is continuing to be very, very strong. So, high level of customer engagement and interest, going right up to this point, and continuing to convert to the platform.  So, I think people's conviction in terms of they see the value of the product, obviously, not only the power of having one integrated system, but the interoperability ability which we have. We'd expect nearly 90% of all interoperable pumps in the US are BD pumps today. It's a capability that we have that we think is at another level than others are able to offer. And we also, of course, have the integrated medication management solution that connects more broadly. And so, feedback early on is that customers still see that value and will be working to help people as possible to wait for that. Of course, we have a very, very large install base, and that normally takes \u2013 we see people upgrade every \u2013 let's say, 10 years in general. We see people begin to refresh their fleet. So, we also recognize people have flexibility in terms of do they do that right now or do they wait until we get our updated 510(k) in place. Of course, we'll have a better sense of how fast we'll be able to re-engage with customers as we continue our dialogue with the FDA and as we get that 510(k) updated and submitted. And that's our number one focus right now, is getting that filing done, which will reflect not only the upgrades that we're making right now, but it's going to reflect the changes to the software that have also been made historically, will all be included in this updated 510(k) that we'll be submitting.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you be a little bit more specific here on the steps that are required with respect to submission of the 510(k)? The software upgrades that that you're doing, can you tell us kind of where you are there, why that would take so long to maybe submit sometime in the fourth quarter? It seems like some of these software upgrades were kind of already done and you've got to kind of repackage them? I just want to dig into what specifically did the FDA come in say that they didn't like about your quality systems. What changes do you think you need to make more broadly on the quality system side? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Hey, Brian. It's Tom. So, let me start with your last question and then work our way forward. So, as I mentioned, based on the quality system in our infusion business, we've made software upgrades over time to the Alaris system. And over that period of time, and we're talking \u2013 not this year, we're talking a number of years, our quality process determined that those upgrade that we've been making in that business did not require a 510(k) clearance.  And so, most recently, on the most recent changes and updates that we've made, we follow that same process and our team determined based on that process that those recent updates in November also did not require an new 510(k) clearance. And so, we released that software improvement in December and we resumed shipping, as we had shared with you last month. Since what we've learned \u2013 and as I mentioned, we had a key meeting with the FDA as recently as this Monday. Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, we learned that the FDA disagreed with that determination about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for the updated software. And that applies not just to the upgraded software that we're talking about in November, but that decision process that had occurred over time.  And so, as I said, we're collaborating with the FDA on their request to combine all the Alaris software enhancements and remediation upgrades with the additional changes made to be Alaris system over time, over years, into a more comprehensive regulatory filing which is going to be submitted this summer. And so, while you're right, we are ready to \u2013 we have the information ready for the recent software upgrades, the work that has to take place between now and the submission date is more referenced to the historical changes that have been made over multiple years going back and some additional testing that we need to do on those historic changes to reflect the testing requirements today. So, that's the work that has to be done.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And good morning.\nTom Polen: Good morning.\nBob Hopkins: Morning. On Alaris, I guess the question I have is a little bit bigger picture. In your view, is this 100% Becton-specific issue with the FDA or is the FDA changing their requirements for pumps broadly? The reason I ask the question is I'm struggling to understand kind of how you got caught off guard and how this went from sort of a software upgrade to something much more significant?\nTom Polen: Bob, this is Tom. I can't comment on other organizations, but what I can say is that it's not unprecedented where there are situations where over time a product evolves and then the FDA looks and says, wait a minute, your current 510(k) needs to be updated to reflect those series of changes over time.  And in this case, there was a process in the business and there's a specific quality process within the infusion business, within the consent decree that the team was following that said, each of those individual changes didn't require a 510(k) process. Again, when the FDA looks back at it over a 5, 10-year period, they say, wait a minute, you actually need to put in a 510(k) given that series of changes that have been made. And that's the exact work that we're doing.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.\nKristen Stewart: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to not to beat a dead horse, but on Alaris, I guess once you do submit the software upgrade platform, I guess, in the summer, what would be the timeline that you would expect for this package to be approved by the FDA? And then, what would be your expectation for it to be rolled out to customers? I'm just trying to gauge again, going back to the impact for FY 2021 and, I guess, how should we just think about this in terms of customer waiting on the sidelines and just the degree with medical necessity? How difficult is that for customers to qualify for? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yeah. thanks, Kristen, for the question. So, let me answer your last question first. When it comes to medical necessity, we are working collaboratively with the FDA to put in place a process for customers to continue to get access to new Alaris pumps under medical necessity. And that's again as required for medical necessity and that process is getting finalized now. We'll be reviewing that process with the FDA and then providing that to customers. Of course, it is a life sustaining product in many cases and there will be needs for medical necessity pumps, we expect, and we have requests for those now, certainly in house. When it comes to clearance and timing for that, I'd say, of course, we're very focused right now on getting that 510(k) submitted. Clearance timing, we're working again with the FDA. I think it's probably not prudent to speculate until we get the feedback from the FDA.  In parallel, though, I would say that the work on the catch-up 510(k) that I've described, we've started that work in full and have momentum well underway. That's why we have a good sense of and confidence in the timing of submission.  Thanks, Kristen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, just one on \u2013 just trying to go through the math. The $400 million cut to pump revenues, is that assuming no placements at all, pump placements? If the market is $2 billion, I'm just trying to map work here on the impact for the back half there. Or if this is just a software, given you guys are so deep in the connectivity part, on the digital part, this is connected to your Pyxis. Cancustomers purchase an older version of the pump and then upgrade the software once the FDA, I guess, approves the new 510(k)? And related to that, do you think this has any impact on Pyxis at all now because I know you have some bundled up sales going on? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Hey Vijay. Tom. Thanks for the question. So, we don't expect any impact on Pyxis. We continue to have strong momentum there. And again, we have late stage ongoing discussions with customers who we think many of them will wait for the Alaris product to be able to resume shipping in order to either convert or to upgrade their fleet. Again, we stand by the safety of the products, and so this is a delay in terms of when we can ship new pumps is what we're focused on.  By the way, when we ship under medical necessity, we will be shipping, we expect, the prior version of the software, to your question, and we can't ship \u2013 I think you had alluded to, can we just go back and ship the prior version of the pump more broadly. And, no, the answer is no, we can't do that. We're limiting shipments of pumps exclusively to that under medical necessity as we work with the FDA. And again, we'll keep you updated as we progress and once we get past the 510(k) submission.\nChristopher Reidy: And I would just say, in response to your first part of your question, just again for clarity, that the low end of our range, the 2.5%, would assume that there are essentially no pumps sold and the entire amount of revenue was taken out. And we would have to assume that there would be \u2013 pumps sold under medical necessity would be limited, but the rest of the range up from the low end of the range would account for some sales of pumps under medical necessity, as well as the normal range that we would have in the guidance.\nTom Polen: As you can imagine, given the situation, we want to be particularly prudent and make sure that, again, as we work collaboratively with the FDA here, we'll know more as those discussions progress.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.\nLawrence Keusch: Thanks. Good morning. Just a two-part question here. So, I guess, once you have this new software package cleared by the FDA, I'm curious as to where that puts you relative to overarching FDA desires within the pump space? It's my sense that the FDA has been a little bit frustrated that a lot of the pumps out there really are not up to the standards that they would like. So, I'm trying to get a sense of where this ultimately puts you once you kind of go through the pain of getting this all done.  And I guess the second part of the question is, in other areas of the business where there have been software upgrades over time such as Pyxis, have you gone back and had a review there or might you need 510(k) filings there as well? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Hey, Larry. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of the question regarding the overall pumps, this catch-up 510(k) is going to be extremely comprehensive. And so, to your point, we feel that this will put us actually a good spot in terms of getting full compliance. Again, we're working with the FDA, so that, at the end of the day, once we get this 510(k) established, the new one, we'll be fully meeting the expectations of the FDA and we're having that active dialogue, obviously, understanding their expectations, how our process may have led us to make some different decisions there. But we're getting all of that reflected and put into an FDA that will be completely comprehensive with the latest expectations and requirements. And that's the reason for that submission timeline because we are being prudent and fully comprehensive to the full expectations of the FDA. So, you could say that should put us in a good position going forward.  On Pyxis is not a 510(k) approved product. It's not regulated in the same way as it's a dispensing system. So, certainly, on other products in the company, we are assessing that, but it doesn't pertain to Pyxis.\nLawrence Keusch: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.\nRick Wise: Good morning, Tom. Hi Chris.\nTom Polen: Good morning.\nRick Wise: Two questions from me and I'll just ask them upfront. I was last night rereading your comments at the BD annual meeting where you very clearly restated/emphasized your goals for a 5% to 6% durable top line growth, I think was your language, and low double-digit bottom line. I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about those goals today.  Two, what impact do we imagine this has on your goal of 50 basis point to 100 basis point annual improvement in operating margin? And last part of this, it's sort of all of a piece. We're all going to have to contemplate what to do with our fiscal 2021 and beyond numbers. I'm sure you're not ready to give guidance. But do we imagine that wherever we end up this year \u2013 and obviously, I hope it a little better than you're shaping today. But the longer-term guidance, should we imagine that you'll frame \u2013 taking these long-term goals, framing the longer-term outlook off this year or would we imagine, no, fiscal 2021, if all goes well, could be a year of accelerated growth relative to these targets? Thank you.\nChristopher Reidy: So, let me take a shot at that, Rick. Thanks for the question. I'd say that we're only a quarter into this year. So, clearly, it's a little tough to talk about 2021 at this point. This is very recent developments that occurred this week with the FDA which we're addressing.  With size of the impact for FY 2020, keep in mind that a big chunk of the revenue base is coming out this year which does create a bit of an easier compare year-over-year. That's not our focus. Our focus is getting through this issue and working with the FDA to get the pumps shipping again. And I think there's nothing about this situation that changes are 5% to 6% double-digit growth going forward, the underlying business is extremely strong and continues to be strong and will continue to be strong. As I said, the only thing taking our guidance down is this issue. We'll get past this issue and be back to that same standard of delivering value going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you for taking the question. I just was curious on the \u2013 going back to the China volume-based pricing pressure that you've kind of \u2013 took that guide a little bit more conservative based on what you saw between the two quarters. I guess what gives you confidence that this is the right level of headwind to put in there for that issue? And just remind me again, sorry if I missed it, what was contemplated in the full year outlook and what gives you confidence this doesn't kind of become a moving target. Thanks.\nTom Polen: Richard, let me just start and then I'll turn over to Chris. Certainly, as we've shared, it was just getting started when we gave guidance. It hadn't started really rolling out across the provinces. It was in discussion. Very few of them had at started their processes and others were beginning the dialogue. And so, the pace of that happening and the number of provinces was still uncertain. And we made that very clear, I think, when we shared that at that time.  So, we've had another quarter to understand how that's involving and I would say it's evolving a bit faster than we had originally thought it would. Again, we've seen \u2013 this has happened in the generic drug industry. So, we have surrogates to see the model, the pace at which it goes and we've also seen some of the tenders now go through in the last quarter and we've been able to see exactly what pricing changes are being finalized in those tenders. And so, now we've been able to say, okay, here's the exact pricing reductions that we're going to see and the number of provinces and we've built that in.  As we mentioned, as Chris said, so the $200 million business today in China, again, that's out of a $1.2 billion total China business, it is a significant drop in that $200 million business. We've built that in. At the same time, we are redirecting resources from that portfolio of businesses into some of the areas and opportunities we see in Life Sciences and Interventional and we see some opportunities for acceleration in China in those two. It's not a level to offset fully, as you've heard from Chris, but it's certainly that combined with the increased level of flu testing, DCBs and other areas that are doing better than expected. It offsets it for us across the company, and thus why Chris' comment that the complete change in guidance here is 100% associated with the Alaris pump.\nChristopher Reidy: The only thing I would add to that is that the other thing that we saw as the situation developed is the distributors taking down their inventory levels much quicker than we would have originally anticipated as they saw this issue develop as well. So, a big chunk of that happened since the last time we spoke. And we really see that mostly impacting the second quarter. And so, the biggest hit from that additional $60 million that we took China down will hit us in the second quarter and then moderate somewhat in the third and fourth quarter.  But, again, just to kind of go through the math, $200 million business. The last time we spoke, we took it down by $40 million, $200 million being the FY 2019 number. We took it down by $40 million and we're now taking it down an additional $60 million. So, the impact this year across that is $100 million just for that specific item, taking that business down to $100 million going forward. And there will be some spillover into next year, but as you might expect, to a somewhat lesser extent.\nTom Polen: Richard, maybe just to give you a little bit more color because it can be a little tricky. The comment on the distributors, the way that works \u2013 and it has a little bit disproportionate impact in the first year \u2013 is of course we're selling, we and other companies in China, we sell our products to distributors who then sell them to the customers. And so, if we've been selling them at a certain price to the distributors and they have a large inventory of those, they see this process now happening and the ability to now \u2013 they don't get stuck with a bunch of inventory at a higher price if the market price is going down. And so, they're bringing down their days inventory on hand, both so that they wait to see the pricing of all because they don't have bought at high prices and selling at low, and the other thing is they're looking at who's going to win these tenders becomes more uncertain in this environment. And so, again, they don't want to get stuck with a large amount of inventory and you see the channel then taking down the inventory concurrent with the situation. That's all comprehended in the updated guidance that we've given, but just want to give a little bit more color on why we made the comment on distributors have an impact.\nRichard Newitter: That's really helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one the pump and one on DCBs, Tom. So, first, on the pump side, is the consent decree new? I'm sorry if I missed that. And what's the status of your next generation pump? Alaris has, obviously, been very successful, but I think it's been in the market for a while.  And I'll just ask my follow-up up now. On the below-the-knee refiling, what's the status there? And how do you think the 12-month data link and the new metanalysis could impact the chances of approval? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTom Polen: Sure, Larry. I'll take the first question and I'll turn it over to Simon. So, the consent decree, of course, that's been in place from CareFusion at the time of acquisition. That does put certainly heightened regulatory oversight over that business, which also can influence certainly a dialogue with the FDA as well and expectations. And so, that's always been in place. That's nothing new and we're moving forward there.  As we think about timing of our next generation pump, we do have a next generation pump in the pipeline. I'd say we \u2013 it's progressing well. We certainly don't want to talk about timing of submission of that today. The Alaris pump remains \u2013 it certainly is clearly the most preferred product by clinicians across the US and you can see that based on the trajectory over the last several years. And we remain very confident that it will be in a position to continue not only because of the benefits of the product itself, but how it's integrated across a broader medication management suite of solutions. It is very well positioned to be of continued preference going forward. We've got to get this 510(k) catchup submitted, so that we can return to making that available to our customers and for patients. So, Simon, on DCB?\nSimon Campion: Yeah. Good morning. Simon. With respect to the submission on BTK, I would say that we're well advanced in our preparation of that submission and I would say we'll be going into FDA sooner rather than later. So, that's about the size of things on that.  And then, with respect to \u2013 I think you were asking about the more recent data that was published by Katanos, if you saw the information from Link [ph], a couple of weeks ago where we published three-year safety data, we continue to not see any safety signal with our data. And indeed, despite the limitations of the Katanos 2 paper, I think you will note that the significance with respect to the hand signal [ph] that they were seeing was not \u2013 or did not exist when you use a low dose DCB, which is what we have.  So, is it going to material the impact FDA? I don't know. But we're well advanced in our preparation for that and the data that we continue to \u2013 really supports the safety of our products.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to have two little follow-ups on this Alaris situation. The first is, for the comprehensive 510(k) that you are filing and you guided to the end of the year for that, can you talk about any risks or upside there could be to the timing? How is that progressing? Is that a date you're pretty confident about? Is there any risk that flips or could get pulled forward?\nTom Polen: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Again, we just had this \u2013 the most recent discussion with the FDA this Monday. So, I don't want to \u2013 certainly, we're very focused on \u2013 and we're already starting that work on the 510(k). We had had some of that momentum going well before then. But we're going to be in a better position to give you an update on that once we get through it. Our goal right now is to submit and seek clearance as quick as possible and to meet the expectations of the FDA. So, I think it will be premature to speculate on any timing of the clearance process. Thanks.\nMatt Taylor : Assuming that you do file that\u2026\nTom Polen: Sorry, Matt. I think we lost you.\nChristopher Reidy: We go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Good morning. Thanks. I was hoping to just ask about the Interventional business. You commented about the paclitaxel drug-coated balloon headwind improving. Any details you can provide just relative to that 50% decline stake that you put in the ground historically?  And then, also any details just around the shifting of products from vascular surgery into the peripheral and what those products were and any rationale for that? Thanks a lot for taking the question.\nTom Polen: Josh, I would let Simon answer that.\nSimon Campion: Yeah. So, Simon here, Josh. I think we've seen a sequential increase in performance here with respect to SSI DCBs. I won't give you the specifics, but it's \u2013 I would classify it as a material increase in our performance prior to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year.  And then, with respect to sales force alignment, we transferred some of our PleurX business which is our drainage catheter business from the surgery business into the peripheral intervention business, and that's simply synergistic with the call points that we have there. We focus heavily on breast biopsy and implantable ports and delivery of chemotherapy. So, taking care of patients at the end of their life in relation to their pre-existing cancer, PleurX is a perfect fit for that sales force. So, that's what we've done.\nTom Polen: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a quick follow-up and then a broader one. Does this also expand to the syringe in the pain pump in addition to the LVP pump? And then, as I think about Becton, I think the broader value proposition in medication management you have in the hospital, on the good side, I think that probably allows customers to be patient as you kind of work through some of these issues, but on the other side of it, would this not also affect the overall conversation or conversion of some of the broader portfolio with some of your customers or is it not related and maybe some delays in the conversion in other areas?\nTom Polen: Hey, Matthew. Thanks for the question. So, Alaris as a system it includes \u2013 it's all one system, right? So, the Alaris system which is \u2013 one of the reasons the customers do prefer it so much is that it includes an LVP, the syringe and the PCA. They all snap on as modules that you can choose from based on the patients and the types of medications that the patient requires and the administration route. So, those are all fully in scope and comprehended within the guidance that we gave you an update on.  In terms of broader medication management strategy, I think you're exactly right that customers deeply value the full set of solutions there and that that provides an impetus that people want to move in that full direction and not necessarily say I want to just move to having an isolated product that's not helping me manage medications, it's just literally doing a pumping activity and I can't use the data to do things that I can, like how we're using data from pumps and Pyxis and other things to do diversion analytics that you just can't do with other solutions.  So, I think you're right there. We don't see at this point impact even as we are doing broader medication management deals. Of course, there's multiple other products as part of that suite of solutions. There's Pyxis, there's Pyxis Logistics, there's Pyxis Prep, there's HealthSight, there's a number of other products. And those products, of course, can still be used with the existing Alaris space. So, there's nothing stopping people from continuing to add those products on as they continue to use their Alaris products and utilize the data coming off of Alaris to be used as part of that full solution.  Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.\nKristen Stewart: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to, I guess, China, what's the risk that \u2013 I know you're talking about the $200 million business, but just that it continues to spill into other product categories within the broader China business for you. Maybe just talk about the number of provinces that you are seeing and, I guess, just risk that it spreads more broadly within medical products. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the questions, Kristen. I'll turn it over to Alberto to answer that.\nAlberto Mas: Yes. The first thing that I'll say is that we're seeing no evidence of the [indiscernible] procurement applicable to any other category at this moment. The way that we tend to think about it is that there's probably three big variables for you to consider, whether they will consider any new categories that we're in.  The first one will be the total spend of that category \u2013 is it in the top 10 or in the top 20 spend in the hospitals? And the two biggest parts of portfolio they have left, which is flush and PICCs do not fall into that category. The number of competitors \u2013 and again, the other categories within MDS, there's a significantly a less amount of categories. We're talking about a handful versus the peripheral catheters where there are over a dozen, approaching 20 plus small players. And then, the perception of commoditization as well is another factor. We do not think these conditions are necessarily all that applicable today to the other categories.\nTom Polen: Thank you, Alberto. Thank you, Kristen. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Great, thank you. So, as we close today, I want to reiterate BD's strong commitment to product quality, regulatory compliance and patient safety. You expect it, our customers deserve it and our patients depend on it.  While I'm very disappointed that we had to lower our guidance today, I'm also confident that we'll look back on this moment as a catalyst for driving a better BD. Let me assure you that we are taking accountability, we're acting with urgency and we're proceeding with an unwavering commitment to our purpose and the patients we serve.  I'm also confident that our broad portfolio, our global reach and our passionate team of associates provide an incredible opportunity to drive long-term growth and enable us to make a bigger impact on customers, patients and shareholders around the world.  Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thank you, Monique. And good morning, everyone. You saw in our earnings release this morning where we brought down revenue and EPS guidance for the year, and let me just say that resetting expectations is certainly not how I want to start my first call as CEO.  And so, before we jump into what's happening with Alaris, I want to say that how we're going to discuss topics on today's call is what you can expect from me \u2013 straight talk, accountability, and an unwavering commitment to quality and regulatory compliance, our values and doing what's right. At our core, BD is a very purpose-driven company. It's what defines who we are, how we operate, and what actions we take. And you can expect that our purpose and values will be at the heart of how we respond to the current situation with Alaris. Every company is going to face challenges, and the real measure of the company's strength isn't whether or not we face challenges, it's how we respond. And I'm personally focused, along with my entire leadership team, on fully resolving this situation. So, let me take you through what happened starting with what we said in November and even more recently and how our conversations with the FDA have continued to evolve, even specifically this week. In November, we told you we were planning to make some improvements to our Alaris pump software, including upgrades to alarm prioritization and optimization. We indicated then that we were in active discussions with the FDA about the timing and implementation of these improvements. Relying on our quality process within the infusion business and how we've managed Alaris software updates over time, the team believed we could take a phased approach to releasing Alaris software updates and that these releases did not require a 510(k) clearance. We then issued the first phase of our software updates in December, and we resumed shipping as we shared with you last month.  Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, including an in-depth discussion this past Monday, we learned that the FDA disagreed with our conclusion about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for these software upgrades.  And in light of the consent decree, the FDA has requested that we combine all Alaris software enhancements, recall remediation updates, and changes made to the Alaris system over time into a single comprehensive 510(k) filing, which we're going to submit in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. We're actively continuing to collaborate with the FDA to ensure we meet their expectations for this upcoming regulatory submission.  I want to be clear here that while we relied on our infusion quality process and system, we've now learned that in this case it did not meet FDA's expectations, and we're committed to taking the appropriate actions to get this right. I also want to be clear that we fully stand behind the safety and the clinical benefits of our product, which is used in the care of 70% of patients undergoing infusion therapy, and that's a responsibility we do not take lightly. We've provided guidance to our customers on how to mitigate potential risks until our software is fully remediated. We've also created a dedicated team of clinical consultants to support live training for healthcare providers, and we will continue to support existing customers to ensure they have access to the Alaris system under medical necessity. As CEO, my foremost focus is on ensuring the right supporting processes, capabilities, and execution within the company to ensure we deliver on FDA expectations. Chris will discuss this more, but as you saw in our news release, based on this situation, we reduced our guidance range by approximately $400 million in revenue and $0.60 in EPS for fiscal year 2020. I also want to comment on China's volume-based procurement initiatives and which we've shared would be impacting our MDS catheter business and that we now have a much better sense of how the situation is evolving than we did last month. So, while it's progressing faster than we initially forecasted in November, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. We've got several upsides from the rest of our business in China, which are expected to grow double digits during the year, and there are also a few other areas that we're doing better than expected in so far, including flu testing, DCBs, and FX. We are a strong company with a diverse portfolio, both in terms of our products and our geographies, and there's a lot of good things happening across BD. And I want to highlight just a few. First, our Q1 results were in line with the expectations we shared with you in November. The businesses and the regions delivered solid performance, led by Life Sciences where we saw an incremental benefit from the flu and our Interventional segment where we saw growth from new products and DCBs also started a bit better than expected. During the quarter, we continued to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration. We remain on track to deliver $100 million in cost synergies this year, which brings our total to $300 million over the three-year deal period. We also continue to scale our commercial programs as part of our commitment to achieve $250 million in revenue synergies by 2022.  We've continued to make good progress there with things we've talked to you about in the past, such as the European biosurgery incubator, vascular access management, and our international product registrations. Another strength in FY 2020 is our ability to deliver on a robust pipeline of new products, and we're already off to a solid cadence with 11 new launches so far in Q1.  And there's three I'd like to just call your attention to. In Medical, we're continuing to innovate in our vascular access portfolio. And we recently launched the new PowerPICC Provena catheter with SOLO 2 valve technology, which makes the catheter easier to care for. Our early feedback from customers is extremely positive. In Life Sciences, we recently introduced the BD COR molecular system that's targeted in Europe. This flagship innovation completely automates the molecular laboratory workflow, and our initial system configuration is available with the BD Onclarity HPV assay, which is used for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. We're still very early in this launch, but we feel really good about the progress we've made so far, having already signed 10 high-value volume accounts in Q1. Of course, we're new to the HPV market, and so all of that is new business for BD. In Interventional, we received clearance for EleVation, our next-generation vacuum assisted breast biopsy device, which helps ensure tissue samples, high-quality tissue samples regardless of the density of the breast tissue. It's early, but we're getting very positive clinical feedback here as well. We're excited by these and our other launches and our long-term innovation pipeline.  What you see on slide five captures our major launches for FY 2020, but it's only a small portion of the total active R&D projects that we expect to bring to market over the next three to five years. We're also entering several new higher growth market spaces with our overall R&D pipeline focused in markets growing 1% to 2% faster than our existing product portfolio. And we see elements of our automation and informatics capabilities in the pipeline across each of our three segments, including now in Interventional where we're starting to leverage BD's capabilities to digitize the legacy Bard portfolio. Before I turn things over to Chris, I want to make some comments on the coronavirus. First, as it comes to the coronavirus, the health and the safety of employees in China and around the world is our top priority.  We're closely tracking the virus in China and we're paying particular attention to the guidance from the US CDC, the WHO and health officials in China.  As you'd expect from us, we're also supporting response efforts in China by providing in-kind and monetary donations to the Wuhan Red Cross and Project Hope. BD doesn't manufacture \u2013 we don't have any manufacturing or distribution operations in the Wuhan or Hubei province and we are adhering to the guidance from the Chinese government and extending the Chinese New Year holiday until February 10 at our offices and facilities in Suzhou and Shanghai. From a supply chain perspective, about 95% of the products we manufacture in China are sold and used within China. We currently have sufficient inventory of the few products that we export from China to meet current demand. And within China, imports of goods and raw materials are being received as expected. In terms of business impact, of course, the situation is still very dynamic. We are closely watching and balancing two trends. First, we are seeing fewer people go to the hospital to seek standard care. At the same time, we have received and installed several urgent orders for additional BD MAX molecular systems, which are being used in coronavirus testing. Chris will take you through how we're contemplating this within our guidance. We'll continue to closely monitor the situation and keep you updated as it evolves. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Hey, Robbie, this is Tom. I'll take the first two questions and then turn it to Chris for your last one. So, of the $400 million, that is essentially pump capital that we're unable to ship. Of course, we have a very large install base in the field. We aren't expecting any meaningful impact on our consumable business there. We actually have seen some increase in consumable demand certainly because of the flu season. And as we mentioned, we stand very strongly behind the quality of the products and its continued usage in delivering 70% of infusions, particularly in the US. Lingering into 2021, what I could say at this point is, look, we know what we need to do to address this situation, and that's to submit the updated 510(k) within Q4, as I shared. So, that's what we're focused on right now. The timing in which we're going to get \u2013 we're working collaboratively with the FDA, and I'd say we'll give you updates as that progresses in terms of our ability to open up and resume shipping. So, as we continue that collaboration with the FDA, we'll have more visibility and we'll keep you updated. Hey, David. So, what I would say is, of course, customers have been increasingly selecting the Alaris product, as you know, for many years and we've seen that in continued share gains in the category. I would say, going into FY 2020 this year, we've had really \u2013 that momentum is continuing to be very, very strong. So, high level of customer engagement and interest, going right up to this point, and continuing to convert to the platform.  So, I think people's conviction in terms of they see the value of the product, obviously, not only the power of having one integrated system, but the interoperability ability which we have. We'd expect nearly 90% of all interoperable pumps in the US are BD pumps today. It's a capability that we have that we think is at another level than others are able to offer. And we also, of course, have the integrated medication management solution that connects more broadly. And so, feedback early on is that customers still see that value and will be working to help people as possible to wait for that. Of course, we have a very, very large install base, and that normally takes \u2013 we see people upgrade every \u2013 let's say, 10 years in general. We see people begin to refresh their fleet. So, we also recognize people have flexibility in terms of do they do that right now or do they wait until we get our updated 510(k) in place. Of course, we'll have a better sense of how fast we'll be able to re-engage with customers as we continue our dialogue with the FDA and as we get that 510(k) updated and submitted. And that's our number one focus right now, is getting that filing done, which will reflect not only the upgrades that we're making right now, but it's going to reflect the changes to the software that have also been made historically, will all be included in this updated 510(k) that we'll be submitting. Yeah. Hey, Brian. It's Tom. So, let me start with your last question and then work our way forward. So, as I mentioned, based on the quality system in our infusion business, we've made software upgrades over time to the Alaris system. And over that period of time, and we're talking \u2013 not this year, we're talking a number of years, our quality process determined that those upgrade that we've been making in that business did not require a 510(k) clearance.  And so, most recently, on the most recent changes and updates that we've made, we follow that same process and our team determined based on that process that those recent updates in November also did not require an new 510(k) clearance. And so, we released that software improvement in December and we resumed shipping, as we had shared with you last month. Since what we've learned \u2013 and as I mentioned, we had a key meeting with the FDA as recently as this Monday. Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, we learned that the FDA disagreed with that determination about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for the updated software. And that applies not just to the upgraded software that we're talking about in November, but that decision process that had occurred over time.  And so, as I said, we're collaborating with the FDA on their request to combine all the Alaris software enhancements and remediation upgrades with the additional changes made to be Alaris system over time, over years, into a more comprehensive regulatory filing which is going to be submitted this summer. And so, while you're right, we are ready to \u2013 we have the information ready for the recent software upgrades, the work that has to take place between now and the submission date is more referenced to the historical changes that have been made over multiple years going back and some additional testing that we need to do on those historic changes to reflect the testing requirements today. So, that's the work that has to be done. Good morning. Bob, this is Tom. I can't comment on other organizations, but what I can say is that it's not unprecedented where there are situations where over time a product evolves and then the FDA looks and says, wait a minute, your current 510(k) needs to be updated to reflect those series of changes over time.  And in this case, there was a process in the business and there's a specific quality process within the infusion business, within the consent decree that the team was following that said, each of those individual changes didn't require a 510(k) process. Again, when the FDA looks back at it over a 5, 10-year period, they say, wait a minute, you actually need to put in a 510(k) given that series of changes that have been made. And that's the exact work that we're doing. Yeah. thanks, Kristen, for the question. So, let me answer your last question first. When it comes to medical necessity, we are working collaboratively with the FDA to put in place a process for customers to continue to get access to new Alaris pumps under medical necessity. And that's again as required for medical necessity and that process is getting finalized now. We'll be reviewing that process with the FDA and then providing that to customers. Of course, it is a life sustaining product in many cases and there will be needs for medical necessity pumps, we expect, and we have requests for those now, certainly in house. When it comes to clearance and timing for that, I'd say, of course, we're very focused right now on getting that 510(k) submitted. Clearance timing, we're working again with the FDA. I think it's probably not prudent to speculate until we get the feedback from the FDA.  In parallel, though, I would say that the work on the catch-up 510(k) that I've described, we've started that work in full and have momentum well underway. That's why we have a good sense of and confidence in the timing of submission.  Thanks, Kristen. Hey Vijay. Tom. Thanks for the question. So, we don't expect any impact on Pyxis. We continue to have strong momentum there. And again, we have late stage ongoing discussions with customers who we think many of them will wait for the Alaris product to be able to resume shipping in order to either convert or to upgrade their fleet. Again, we stand by the safety of the products, and so this is a delay in terms of when we can ship new pumps is what we're focused on.  By the way, when we ship under medical necessity, we will be shipping, we expect, the prior version of the software, to your question, and we can't ship \u2013 I think you had alluded to, can we just go back and ship the prior version of the pump more broadly. And, no, the answer is no, we can't do that. We're limiting shipments of pumps exclusively to that under medical necessity as we work with the FDA. And again, we'll keep you updated as we progress and once we get past the 510(k) submission. As you can imagine, given the situation, we want to be particularly prudent and make sure that, again, as we work collaboratively with the FDA here, we'll know more as those discussions progress. Hey, Larry. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of the question regarding the overall pumps, this catch-up 510(k) is going to be extremely comprehensive. And so, to your point, we feel that this will put us actually a good spot in terms of getting full compliance. Again, we're working with the FDA, so that, at the end of the day, once we get this 510(k) established, the new one, we'll be fully meeting the expectations of the FDA and we're having that active dialogue, obviously, understanding their expectations, how our process may have led us to make some different decisions there. But we're getting all of that reflected and put into an FDA that will be completely comprehensive with the latest expectations and requirements. And that's the reason for that submission timeline because we are being prudent and fully comprehensive to the full expectations of the FDA. So, you could say that should put us in a good position going forward.  On Pyxis is not a 510(k) approved product. It's not regulated in the same way as it's a dispensing system. So, certainly, on other products in the company, we are assessing that, but it doesn't pertain to Pyxis. Good morning. Richard, let me just start and then I'll turn over to Chris. Certainly, as we've shared, it was just getting started when we gave guidance. It hadn't started really rolling out across the provinces. It was in discussion. Very few of them had at started their processes and others were beginning the dialogue. And so, the pace of that happening and the number of provinces was still uncertain. And we made that very clear, I think, when we shared that at that time.  So, we've had another quarter to understand how that's involving and I would say it's evolving a bit faster than we had originally thought it would. Again, we've seen \u2013 this has happened in the generic drug industry. So, we have surrogates to see the model, the pace at which it goes and we've also seen some of the tenders now go through in the last quarter and we've been able to see exactly what pricing changes are being finalized in those tenders. And so, now we've been able to say, okay, here's the exact pricing reductions that we're going to see and the number of provinces and we've built that in.  As we mentioned, as Chris said, so the $200 million business today in China, again, that's out of a $1.2 billion total China business, it is a significant drop in that $200 million business. We've built that in. At the same time, we are redirecting resources from that portfolio of businesses into some of the areas and opportunities we see in Life Sciences and Interventional and we see some opportunities for acceleration in China in those two. It's not a level to offset fully, as you've heard from Chris, but it's certainly that combined with the increased level of flu testing, DCBs and other areas that are doing better than expected. It offsets it for us across the company, and thus why Chris' comment that the complete change in guidance here is 100% associated with the Alaris pump. Richard, maybe just to give you a little bit more color because it can be a little tricky. The comment on the distributors, the way that works \u2013 and it has a little bit disproportionate impact in the first year \u2013 is of course we're selling, we and other companies in China, we sell our products to distributors who then sell them to the customers. And so, if we've been selling them at a certain price to the distributors and they have a large inventory of those, they see this process now happening and the ability to now \u2013 they don't get stuck with a bunch of inventory at a higher price if the market price is going down. And so, they're bringing down their days inventory on hand, both so that they wait to see the pricing of all because they don't have bought at high prices and selling at low, and the other thing is they're looking at who's going to win these tenders becomes more uncertain in this environment. And so, again, they don't want to get stuck with a large amount of inventory and you see the channel then taking down the inventory concurrent with the situation. That's all comprehended in the updated guidance that we've given, but just want to give a little bit more color on why we made the comment on distributors have an impact. Sure, Larry. I'll take the first question and I'll turn it over to Simon. So, the consent decree, of course, that's been in place from CareFusion at the time of acquisition. That does put certainly heightened regulatory oversight over that business, which also can influence certainly a dialogue with the FDA as well and expectations. And so, that's always been in place. That's nothing new and we're moving forward there.  As we think about timing of our next generation pump, we do have a next generation pump in the pipeline. I'd say we \u2013 it's progressing well. We certainly don't want to talk about timing of submission of that today. The Alaris pump remains \u2013 it certainly is clearly the most preferred product by clinicians across the US and you can see that based on the trajectory over the last several years. And we remain very confident that it will be in a position to continue not only because of the benefits of the product itself, but how it's integrated across a broader medication management suite of solutions. It is very well positioned to be of continued preference going forward. We've got to get this 510(k) catchup submitted, so that we can return to making that available to our customers and for patients. So, Simon, on DCB? Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Again, we just had this \u2013 the most recent discussion with the FDA this Monday. So, I don't want to \u2013 certainly, we're very focused on \u2013 and we're already starting that work on the 510(k). We had had some of that momentum going well before then. But we're going to be in a better position to give you an update on that once we get through it. Our goal right now is to submit and seek clearance as quick as possible and to meet the expectations of the FDA. So, I think it will be premature to speculate on any timing of the clearance process. Thanks. Sorry, Matt. I think we lost you. Josh, I would let Simon answer that. Thank you, Josh. Hey, Matthew. Thanks for the question. So, Alaris as a system it includes \u2013 it's all one system, right? So, the Alaris system which is \u2013 one of the reasons the customers do prefer it so much is that it includes an LVP, the syringe and the PCA. They all snap on as modules that you can choose from based on the patients and the types of medications that the patient requires and the administration route. So, those are all fully in scope and comprehended within the guidance that we gave you an update on.  In terms of broader medication management strategy, I think you're exactly right that customers deeply value the full set of solutions there and that that provides an impetus that people want to move in that full direction and not necessarily say I want to just move to having an isolated product that's not helping me manage medications, it's just literally doing a pumping activity and I can't use the data to do things that I can, like how we're using data from pumps and Pyxis and other things to do diversion analytics that you just can't do with other solutions.  So, I think you're right there. We don't see at this point impact even as we are doing broader medication management deals. Of course, there's multiple other products as part of that suite of solutions. There's Pyxis, there's Pyxis Logistics, there's Pyxis Prep, there's HealthSight, there's a number of other products. And those products, of course, can still be used with the existing Alaris space. So, there's nothing stopping people from continuing to add those products on as they continue to use their Alaris products and utilize the data coming off of Alaris to be used as part of that full solution.  Thank you for the question. Thanks for the questions, Kristen. I'll turn it over to Alberto to answer that. Thank you, Alberto. Thank you, Kristen. Great, thank you. So, as we close today, I want to reiterate BD's strong commitment to product quality, regulatory compliance and patient safety. You expect it, our customers deserve it and our patients depend on it.  While I'm very disappointed that we had to lower our guidance today, I'm also confident that we'll look back on this moment as a catalyst for driving a better BD. Let me assure you that we are taking accountability, we're acting with urgency and we're proceeding with an unwavering commitment to our purpose and the patients we serve.  I'm also confident that our broad portfolio, our global reach and our passionate team of associates provide an incredible opportunity to drive long-term growth and enable us to make a bigger impact on customers, patients and shareholders around the world.  Thank you."

            "content": "Yeah. Good morning. Simon. With respect to the submission on BTK, I would say that we're well advanced in our preparation of that submission and I would say we'll be going into FDA sooner rather than later. So, that's about the size of things on that.  And then, with respect to \u2013 I think you were asking about the more recent data that was published by Katanos, if you saw the information from Link [ph], a couple of weeks ago where we published three-year safety data, we continue to not see any safety signal with our data. And indeed, despite the limitations of the Katanos 2 paper, I think you will note that the significance with respect to the hand signal [ph] that they were seeing was not \u2013 or did not exist when you use a low dose DCB, which is what we have.  So, is it going to material the impact FDA? I don't know. But we're well advanced in our preparation for that and the data that we continue to \u2013 really supports the safety of our products. Yeah. So, Simon here, Josh. I think we've seen a sequential increase in performance here with respect to SSI DCBs. I won't give you the specifics, but it's \u2013 I would classify it as a material increase in our performance prior to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year.  And then, with respect to sales force alignment, we transferred some of our PleurX business which is our drainage catheter business from the surgery business into the peripheral intervention business, and that's simply synergistic with the call points that we have there. We focus heavily on breast biopsy and implantable ports and delivery of chemotherapy. So, taking care of patients at the end of their life in relation to their pre-existing cancer, PleurX is a perfect fit for that sales force. So, that's what we've done."

            "name": "Christopher Reidy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Before I take you through our first quarter results and guidance for the full year, I'd like to reinforce Tom's remarks on the Alaris pump issue. As you would expect from us, we take this matter very seriously. We did not anticipate the current Alaris pump situation to materialize the way that it has and I assure you that the senior management team is fully committed to resolving the situation. So with that, let me review our first quarter results. As Tom mentioned, we delivered solid performance in the first quarter. First quarter revenues grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. I'll provide more color on the first quarter revenue growth in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.65, which is at the high-end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS declined about 2% year-over-year and was about flat on a currency neutral basis. As expected, adjusted EPS growth reflects solid operating performance, offset by the expiration of the Gore royalty and a very tough compare to last year's first quarter tax rate of 11.2%. Operating margins of 24% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also continued to de-lever during the first quarter, paying down approximately $90 million of debt. At December 31, our gross leverage ratio was 3.5 times and we remain on track to achieve our commitment to de-lever to below 3 times this calendar year. Moving on to slide 10, I'll review the medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical revenues declined 1.1% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. As expected, first quarter performance in the Medical segment was impacted by the new volume-based procurement process being adopted in certain Chinese provinces, which is specific to our catheter business within our medication delivery solutions portfolio of China. Outside of China, we saw strong growth in our vascular access management portfolio of solutions. In addition, as anticipated, revenues in medication management solutions declined due to limited installations of Alaris pumps. In pharmaceutical systems, strength of over 9% reflects our ability to meet high demand for prefillable syringes as a result of our ongoing investments in capacity as conversion from vials to prefillable devices continues. As expected, diabetes care revenues were about flat compared to the prior year, driven by anticipated pricing pressure in the US and the timing of orders that drove the strong Q4 last year as discussed on our previous earnings call. Now, turning to slide 11 and the BD Life Sciences segment, revenues increased 7.4% in the first quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostic systems and biosciences units.  Growth in diagnostic systems was brought based across point-of-care, flu, our molecular diagnostic platforms and our microbiology solutions, as well as our woman's health and cancer portfolio. With continue to see over 20% growth in BD MAX and are receiving very positive feedback on our BD COR launch in Europe.  Very strong growth in biosciences was driven by licensing revenues and demand for instruments and reagents. This was partially offset by a tough comparison due to the divestiture of the advanced bioprocessing product line during last year's first fiscal quarter. Growth in pre-analytical systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year when revenues grew 7.6%, driven by additional capacity brought on to meet demand for our pushbutton blood collection sets and the timing of distributor orders. Now, turning to slide 12 and the BD Interventional segment, revenues increased 5% in the first quarter, with mid-single-digit growth across all three business units.  Revenue growth in peripheral intervention was broad-based, including performance in our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products that continue to perform extremely well.  DCB-related revenues was slightly better than planned as the trend we have been seeing since the FDA letter has improved. Excluding the DCB impact, revenues in peripheral intervention grew over 8%. First quarter revenue growth in surgery reflects strong double-digit performance in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in hernia. We saw robust growth across the US, Europe and China. As you may recall, we relaunched Progel last year and are now approaching our historical run rate in sales. Revenue growth in urology and critical care continues to be driven by performance across our acute urology, home care and targeted temperature management business.  Moving to slide 13 and our geographic revenues, developed markets grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in the US in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments was partially offset by a decline in the Medical segment as anticipated due to the infusion pump software upgrade, as previously discussed. We also spoke saw strong performance in Europe in vascular care within MDS. Molecular diagnostics, lab automation in women's health and cancer and diagnostic systems and hernia and biosurgery within the surgery unit. Emerging markets revenues grew 5.1% for the first quarter. Performance was driven by nearly double-digit growth in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. China revenues reflect strong double-digit growth in Life Sciences and Interventional segments as anticipated. The Medical segment's performance in China was also in line with our expectations as strong double-digit growth across MMS, diabetes care and pharmaceutical systems was offset by the impact of volume-based procurement related to peripheral catheters in MDS. As we started the new fiscal year, the situation in China remained fluid. When we provided guidance in November, we told you about a new volume-based procurement process that several provinces had adopted, which was modeled after similar initiatives for generic drugs and other spending categories. While the program covers a wide variety of consumable medical products for BD, it's focus on our $200 million peripheral catheter portfolio within our MDS business. While we anticipated that it would expand, we have now seen volume-based procurement expand at a faster rate. In addition, we are seeing distributors reduce inventory levels in large part due to, and in anticipation of, this new procurement process and we are assuming that will continue. As Tom said, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. However, as a result of these dynamics, we now expect low-single-digit growth in China for the full fiscal year. Excluding the MDS portfolio, we are seeing high double-digit growth in China and are pleased with our performance in that region. Now, turning to slide 14 which recaps the first quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 2.5%. This includes 80 basis points of pricing pressure, which is in line with our expectations as we had anticipated pricing would be most acute in the first quarter as certain prior-year pricing agreements annualize. For the full fiscal year, we expect pricing to decline approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points. Moving down the P&L, gross profit grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Gross margin was a solid 56.5%. SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 26.5%. This reflects additional deferred compensation expense due to strong stock market performance in the quarter. For your reference, deferred compensation expense is fully offset in the other income net line. On an underlying basis, SSG&A expenses grew in line with sales and reflect our ongoing focus on disciplined spending and the achievement of Bard cost synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6%. For the full fiscal year, we expect to invest $1 billion in R&D which reflects our continued commitment to drive innovation.  As a result, operating margins decreased 50 basis points or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis which is in line with our expectations. Our tax rate was 15.3% in the quarter, in line with our full-year guidance range of 14% to 16%. And as expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the preferred shares will convert in May of this year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.65 as previously discussed. Now, turning to slide 15 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. Gross profit margin of 56.5% improved 30 basis points on a performance basis. This reflects our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies, partially offset by the impact of pricing. Operating margin of 24% declined 50 basis points in the quarter or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis. As previously discussed, this was driven by higher deferred compensation expense recorded within SSG&A that is offset below operating income in the other income net line item. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation, operating margins would have increased 40 basis points currency neutral. Currency had a negative impact of 10 basis points on both gross and operating margins in the quarter. Now, moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2020 revenue and P&L guidance. As you've already heard from Tom, we are revising our revenue growth guidance to 2.5% to 3.5%, specifically due to the Alaris situation. Our updated range reflects several scenarios based on our ongoing conversations with the FDA, with the bottom end of our range assuming a very limited ability to ship Alaris pumps this fiscal year. By segment, for the full year, we now expect BD Medical revenue growth to be about flat. We expect both BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional revenue growth be at the high-end of our previous guidance ranges of 6% to 7% and 5% to 6% respectively. We now anticipate low single-digit growth in developed markets in fiscal 2020. In emerging markets, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, driven by a diversified base of low single-digit growth in China, as previously discussed, and strengthen in EMA.  Based on our new guidance for FY 2020, we now expect revenue growth in the second quarter to be approximately 2% and EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.50. This includes an approximately $20 million to $30 million headwind from coronavirus within the quarter. This impact is contemplated within our full-year guidance range. Moving down the P&L, we have updated our gross profit margin, SSG&A and operating margin guidance to reflect the infusion pump impact. Our updated SSG&A and operating margin guidance ranges also include the first quarter impact of deferred compensation. For the full fiscal year, we now expect gross margin to be about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range and operating margin to improve approximately 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis. The balance of our P&L guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2020 remain unchanged. Moving on to slide 17, this reflects our revised EPS guidance for the total year. As you can see, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $11.90 to $12.10, which reflects our latest view on FX and the impact of Alaris pumps. In summary, we delivered a solid first quarter, in line with our expectation. We continue to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration and on bringing to market our robust innovation pipeline, launching 11 new products during the quarter.  Moving to the balance of the year, we take the news we delivered today very seriously and we are fully committed to resolving the Alaris situation and returning to our long-standing track record of delivering value to customers, their patients and shareholders.  Thanks. And I'd like to now open the call up for Q&A. I would just add to provide clarity to the guidance change. Up until the infusion pump issue this week in our meeting with the FDA this week, we were fully planning to reaffirm our guidance for fiscal year 2020. The 2.5% to 3.5% revenue growth guidance assumes essentially, on the low-end, that we sell virtually no pumps. And of our 450-ish kind of US infusion pump business, the range above that would expect the normal range of guidance that we would've had prior to this issue as well as the potential of selling some pumps under medical necessity. So, what I would say is, it's 100% pumps because as you think about the puts and takes that we had this year, we are seeing upside on the flu side. We're seeing better performance in DCBs as we talked about. So, we have some strong performance in the rest of the business. China, outside of the value-based \u2013 volume-based procurement is doing extremely well, strong double digits across Interventional and Life Sciences. So, we had some upside. We did take into consideration the acceleration of the volume-based procurement. That stepped up. Just to kind of give you a sense, that's $200 million peripheral catheter business for us. Last quarter, we took it down by about $40 million. We've accelerated that by about $60 million, partly because of accelerations in the province tenders that we are seeing, but even more dramatically, the distributors taking down inventories in anticipation of these tenders. And so, that's an additional $60 million. So, we've taken down an additional $60 million. So, that takes us down to about $100 million left in that business going forward. That $60 million, plus the coronavirus of about $20 million to $30 million, we're offsetting with the strong performance, as I talked about, in other parts of the business.  So as I said, going into this week, we had all of that in the mix and would have still reaffirmed our guidance for the year. So, you can think about the takedown as entirely the Alaris pump issue. And I would just say, in response to your first part of your question, just again for clarity, that the low end of our range, the 2.5%, would assume that there are essentially no pumps sold and the entire amount of revenue was taken out. And we would have to assume that there would be \u2013 pumps sold under medical necessity would be limited, but the rest of the range up from the low end of the range would account for some sales of pumps under medical necessity, as well as the normal range that we would have in the guidance. So, let me take a shot at that, Rick. Thanks for the question. I'd say that we're only a quarter into this year. So, clearly, it's a little tough to talk about 2021 at this point. This is very recent developments that occurred this week with the FDA which we're addressing.  With size of the impact for FY 2020, keep in mind that a big chunk of the revenue base is coming out this year which does create a bit of an easier compare year-over-year. That's not our focus. Our focus is getting through this issue and working with the FDA to get the pumps shipping again. And I think there's nothing about this situation that changes are 5% to 6% double-digit growth going forward, the underlying business is extremely strong and continues to be strong and will continue to be strong. As I said, the only thing taking our guidance down is this issue. We'll get past this issue and be back to that same standard of delivering value going forward. The only thing I would add to that is that the other thing that we saw as the situation developed is the distributors taking down their inventory levels much quicker than we would have originally anticipated as they saw this issue develop as well. So, a big chunk of that happened since the last time we spoke. And we really see that mostly impacting the second quarter. And so, the biggest hit from that additional $60 million that we took China down will hit us in the second quarter and then moderate somewhat in the third and fourth quarter.  But, again, just to kind of go through the math, $200 million business. The last time we spoke, we took it down by $40 million, $200 million being the FY 2019 number. We took it down by $40 million and we're now taking it down an additional $60 million. So, the impact this year across that is $100 million just for that specific item, taking that business down to $100 million going forward. And there will be some spillover into next year, but as you might expect, to a somewhat lesser extent. We go to the next question."

I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook for fiscal 2022. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will open the call up for Q&A. Now let's jump into our results and key highlights for the year on Slide 7. We were very pleased with the strong close to fiscal 2021, which drove full-year revenues, EPS and cash flows ahead of our expectations despite a volatile environment. This reflects our continued laser-focus on execution and the strength and expansiveness of our diversified business and geographic model. Revenues grew over 15% to more than $20 billion in fiscal 2021, with $2 billion in COVID testing revenues and strong 8.1% growth in our base business. Our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $13.08. And through continued execution of cash flow initiatives we instituted in fiscal 2020, we further improved our operating cash flow by over $1.1 billion compared to the prior-year. Overall performance reflects strong momentum in our base business with a return to more normalized growth rates across all three segments versus pre-pandemic revenue level. As hospitals have been able to return to serving both COVID and non-COVID patients, and the overall healthcare utilization levels increased, we saw a strong demand for our broad portfolio of products that were essential to patient care, including new products delivered across our innovation pipeline. At the same time, we were proud to have supported our customers and the patients they serve, by bringing to market and scaling a broad range of innovations to help the world diagnose, treat, and prevent COVID. Turning to Slide 8, at the highest level, our strategy has been deeply rooted in helping healthcare systems balance four key priorities. And those are improving outcomes, driving efficiencies, expanding access to care, and more important than ever, improving the clinician experience. BD is uniquely positioned to help our customers deliver against these three key priorities across discovery and diagnosis, medication delivery, and interventional treatment. And through our innovation-driven growth strategy, we're investing in our broad, foundational durable core portfolio, while also shifting a larger portion of our business into higher growth, higher impact areas. And those three higher growth higher impact areas that we're focused on, you've heard me talk about before are smart connected care, enabling the transition of treatments in new care settings, and improving chronic disease outcomes. In addition, by simplifying our product portfolio, we're driving growth through increased efficiency and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 9. Importantly, we significantly advanced our strategy this past fiscal year, taking bold steps to position BD for the long-term. Beginning with the actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our working capital and cash flows. These actions have positioned our cash and net leverage well. Giving us the capacity to increase investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, accelerating our innovation pipeline, and advancing our strategy to drive growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. In FY 2021, we invested over $1.2 billion in R&D, 21% more than last year, with increased funding for key projects through our new growth and innovation fund. We also continued our increased pace of tuck-in acquisitions, completing seven acquisitions in fiscal 2021, as well as a number of additional early phase investments as we also began to build our long-term inorganic funnel. In addition, we reinvested over $200 million in profits from COVID testing to drive our growth strategy. Through investments in our commercial organizations indeed and accelerate our simplification strategy by investing to speed up our recode portfolio and architecture program. And today, these investments are meaningfully advancing our strategy to expand in higher-growth spaces, across smart connected care, new care settings, and chronic disease outcomes. And just a few recent accomplishments that I can share here underscore our growing momentum. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more of those accomplishments next week at Analyst Day. These include new manufacturing lines that are now operational and will support demand for vaccination devices globally. And this investment is in addition to our $1.2 billion commitment to expand capacity for our pre-fillable syringe, and advanced drug delivery systems, which represent high-growth opportunities in our durable core. Emergency used authorization for BD Veritor At-Home, which is the first at-home COVID antigen test to use a smartphone to interpret and report results. This platform is a great example of how we're applying digital capabilities to bring new first to world innovations to market and expanding care to new settings. We also received 510(k) clearance of expanded indications for Rotarex Atherectomy System to include treatment of in-stent restenosis, which is a first of its kind label expansion and it's a great example of how we expand optionality for physicians and customers in the treatment of chronic disease. We also received U.S. FDA approval of our new high throughput molecular system BD COR. In today's challenging labor environment, BD COR's advanced robotics and software algorithms provide customers a way to do more testing with less available staff while providing important new clinical insights for cervical cancer screening and management through our BD Onclarity, HPV Assay. Now beyond BD COR, as you know, we have a portfolio and pipeline of unique automated solutions that help our customers perform in a tight labor market from helping nursing staff and pharmacists be more efficient with medication management, to increasing efficiency in diagnostic testing for labs experiencing staffing shortages. We're engaging with customers in these markets and are seeing great interest in our solutions. At our Investor Day, we'll share more about how we are well-positioned, not only capitalize on this opportunity, but how we've been very actively optimizing our investment mix to both expand our durable core platforms and simultaneously add technology and platform innovation in higher-impact and higher-growth spaces that we expect to enhance our long-term growth profile. Through our disciplined capital allocation framework, we're balancing these investments and future growth with a return of capital to shareholders through our competitive dividend, while also resuming our share repurchasing program, having repurchased $1.75 billion in fiscal 2021. We also just announced our 50th consecutive year of dividend increases, and we're very proud to be one of only 16 companies across all industries to achieve that milestone. Turing to Slide 10. We'll remain disciplined in our approach to portfolio management as we systematically advance and deliver against our strategy. And earlier this year, we announced the decision to spin-off our diabetes care business. The proposed spin represents a value creation opportunity for all stakeholders and is intended to enable growth acceleration for both BD RemainCo and NewCo with more efficient business processes and allocation of resources and capital. NewCo will be able to invest its capital in growth opportunities, including high-growth geographies markets and next-generation products. We continue to make good progress and the spin-off remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. Regarding our BD Alaris pump, we recently received CE mark and Health Canada approval for the updated BD Alaris system. We also achieved a significant milestone earlier this year with the filing of our BD Alaris 510(k) submission. We have dedicated resources supporting this and continue to make progress. Alaris is an important tool for clinicians and there continues to be strong demand for our platform during the pandemic. Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to share some details about our enhanced ESG strategy Together We Advance. BD has been a longstanding leader as a case study for sustainable business models and innovating for shared value. Our strategy serves as a framework through which BD addresses the most relevant ESG issues for the company and its stakeholders and aims to further our leadership role and build on our commitment to improve and advance individual and public health at a global scale. The health of our company, our planet, our communities, and the people we serve are directly connected. And when we successfully address the health of one, we often solve for challenges of another. And under our strategy, we announced the suite of goals for 2030 and beyond with commitments in five areas that are most important to BD and our stakeholders, and where we have opportunities to create meaningful measured change over the next decade. And those specifically are climate change, product impacts, responsible supply chains, healthy workforce, and communities and transparency. And we're acting on these commitments. And for example, we recently signed on to the United Nations Race To Zero campaign. We look forward to sharing more about the advances and impact we having in each of these areas. Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look ahead, we expect the greater resiliency exhibited by healthcare systems during Delta will continue along with continued recovery and patient demand post-Delta. While there are inflationary pressures occurring across most every industry, we have been very active in addressing these challenges. We have put specific defined actionable plans in place to help mitigate these pressures, which are coordinated through an inflation taskforce that we've established with work streams across procurement, shipping, cost structure, and continuous improvements in our plans. And in this environment, it's also required to initiate pricing actions, which we have begun. Looking ahead, while we believe there will be longer term macro solutions like expanded shipping and resin capacity. We're not waiting for those to occur. Our aim is to be best-in-class in navigating the current environment. We believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery. We're proud of the progress we're making advancing our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. We have excellent momentum in our base business heading into fiscal 2022, a stronger balance sheet, and steadily increasing cash flows, despite inflationary pressures, all positioning us well for the future. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. And again, Chris, welcome.\nChris DelOrefice: Great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Before I jump in, let me first say I couldn't be more excited about joining BD. BD is a purpose-driven company that has both a deep and broad portfolio that includes leadership positions, many important areas in healthcare. Combined with our innovative pipeline of products and solutions, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape the delivery of healthcare and make a meaningful impact on healthcare outcomes around the world. I look forward to engaging with the investment community next week during our Investor Day, and sharing more specifics around our strategy and the actions we are taking to support our growth agenda and deliver long-term value. So with that, let's get into our results. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered on our commitments in 2021, have strong momentum as we enter 2022, and we're well-positioned for the future. Slide 13 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.1 billion increased 7.3% on a reported basis, and 5.9% on an FX neutral basis. And we're ahead of our expectations. Our base business revenues increased 9.8% driven by strong performance across all three segments. In Q4, we saw continued improvement in overall healthcare utilization levels and routine testing and lab activity and higher acuity. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations. For the full fiscal year, our revenues grew 15.6% or 8.1%, excluding COVID testing, which demonstrates the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy across our segments with base growth of 6.8% in the Medical segment, 8.4% in Life Sciences, and 10.7% in the Interventional segment. Base business growth was also strong regionally, particularly in the U.S., China and Latin America. Compared to fiscal 2019, base business revenues grew 4.5% or about 7% when adjusting for the Alaris ship hold. Turning to Slide 14, our Medical segment delivered $2.5 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter growing 7.7% led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses. MDS revenues increased 11.3% and reflects strong demand for our core products, driven by higher acuity, and increased utilization in the U.S. and Europe and competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. In MMS, Q4 revenues were comparable to the prior-year despite the high number of infusion pump placements in Europe last year to support hospital needs. We continue to see solid growth in our dispensing platform and a high number of committed contracts with Q4 being one of our strongest quarters to-date for committed contracts. Revenue growth of 5.4% in diabetes care benefited from the timing associated with certain sales and slightly better than expected market demand. On a normalized basis, we see diabetes growth about flat. Pharm systems growth of 12.3% reflects continued strong growth driven by demand for our prefilled devices and enabled by capacity expansion. Demand for prefilled devices is being aided by the fast-paced vial to prefilled device conversion for biologics, vaccines, and other injectable drugs. Turning to Slide 15, BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter increasing 1.5%. However excluding COVID testing, Life Sciences grew 15.8%. Performance reflects strong double-digit growth in our base business in both Integrated Diagnostics Solutions and Biosciences, partially offset by declining COVID testing revenues. In IDS, 16.2% growth in the base business was driven by specimen management and microbiology, lab utilization improved, and demand increased for both core products and products used during the care of COVID patients. We're also seeing strong growth in sales of BD MAX IVD assays, which were up about 20% year-over-year. IDS base revenues also included sales of our combination fluid COVID assays for both Veritor and BD MAX that began shipping in Q4. Early demand is robust, and we believe the combination test will become the standard of care for symptomatic testing across laboratory and point of care testing as we enter the flu season. Despite increased demand driven by the Delta variant, and shipping our highest quarterly volume of over 30 million tests, COVID testing revenues declined in Q4 from $452 million to $316 million due to lower pricing in the market. Biosciences revenues increased 14.6% driven by research solutions, as lab utilization is returning to normal levels. We continue to see solid demand for research reagents globally. Our recently launched e-commerce site is a new vehicle for growth and has been well received with strong traffic. Turning to Slide 16, BD Interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter growing 8.3%. As we previously communicated, we began to see an impact on the Delta variant on elective procedures in certain U.S. states in July and August. While we contemplated some continuation of that impact, it was slightly greater than anticipated in our surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses as hospitals reduced access and restricted elective procedures. Our surgery business grew 16.8%, reflecting the year-over-year recovery in elective procedures, with double-digit growth in infection prevention and biosurgery and strength in hernia despite some impacts from the Delta variant. Growth in infection prevention also reflects continued market adoption of our sterile ChloraPrep product. Revenues in Peripheral Intervention increased 5.5%. We saw continued strong performance in atherectomy as we have leveraged the capabilities of RPI sales force and an oncology as more people completed cancer screenings. PI also continues to be impacted by a product recall which impacted growth by about 300 basis points. Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 3.8% driven by continued strong demand for PureWick, as well as continued adoption of the recently launched Arctic Sun with our Targeted Temperature Management platform. Partially offsetting this growth was a temporary supply disruption within acute urology that is now remedy. We expect shipments to be caught up within the first quarter of FY 2022. For the full fiscal year in 2021, UCC grew 7.6%. Turning to Slide 17, and our Q4 and full-year adjusted P&L. For the quarter we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations, with net income of $770 million and diluted EPS of $2.59. On a currency neutral basis, net income declined 7.8% primarily by lower COVID testing pricing and testing-related one-time costs and reinvestment in the business, as well as higher shipping costs due to inflation, and increased R&D levels. EPS declined slightly less, or 6.5% reflecting a lower share count due to share repurchases. Our full-year adjusted net income and EPS were $3.9 billion and $13.08 respectively, with growth of 31% and 28% driven by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points on an FX neutral basis. We delivered Q4 and full-year operating margins in line with the expectations we previously communicated for the company and for the base business. Turning to Slide 18, cash flows from operations totaled $4.6 billion in fiscal 2021, an increase of over 30% versus fiscal 2020. This improvement in our cash flow has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in capital, R&D, and M&A. During fiscal 2021 we invested in capital expenditures to support high-growth opportunities, including the new manufacturing lines Tom previously mentioned. In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested $500 million in tucking M&A across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond. Beyond our investments in growth, we returned capital to shareholders through $1 billion in dividends and $1.7 billion in share repurchases. We ended the fiscal year with $2.3 billion in cash, and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.6 times. Our current cash and leverage position gives us flexibility to create value through multiple levers. And I look forward to sharing more with you about our capital allocation strategy to our upcoming Investor Day. Now turning to our fiscal 2022 guidance on Slide 20. First the macro assumptions that support our guidance range. While we recognize there will continue to be some variability, we assume there will be continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions as vaccination rates continue to increase and not expect to see continued stabilization of procedures and are not assuming significant disruptions to procedure volumes. Additionally, while we do not expect conditions to return to normal levels, we do not anticipate worsening macro supply chain constraints or inflationary pressures. Finally, we have not assumed any impact of legislation changes that would impact the broader market. Given a significant sales and income generated from testing in fiscal 2021, we previously provided a preliminary guidance score that excluded testing to help you model our underlying base business performance, we will continue to provide our revenue guidance split between base and COVID only testing through this year, along with context regarding testing margins relative to our base business. So a few specific comments on testing assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays at a level comparable to a normal flu season, which you should think of as $75 million to $100 million. For COVID only testing, which is in addition to our base business combo test revenues, we assume the demand would be significantly less in fiscal 2022. Given the variability in the COVID environment driven by uncertainty around the length and intensity of break to outbreaks, our current assumptions are largely based on confirmed orders. We are assuming about $200 million of COVID only testing revenue. If testing revenues were to be substantially higher, we first would compensate for any resulting procedure softness impacting our base revenue and income, which positions as well to manage through this period of uncertainty. Any further upside would be used to create value through either reinvestment or allowing incremental profits to flow through. Regarding Alaris, as Tom noted, we are confident in the progress we were making and the resources that we've invested behind this program. As we previously shared infusion pump clearances are inherently complex, particularly our filing and not so would not be prudent to predict timelines. Consistent with what we share previously, we do not expect and our guidance does not include a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2022. Additionally, it is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. But at this time we've assumed that our Alaris Capital revenues will be generally in line with fiscal year of 2021. Let me now share some perspective on what is underlying our base guidance. We are well-positioned for strong growth across our three segments with a balanced and robust innovation pipeline resulting from investments in increased productivity in R&D. Growth will be further enabled by the strategic acquisitions we've added to our portfolio that are positioned in high-growth categories. While we aren't providing segment specific guidance relative to total company base growth, we do expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below, Life Sciences growth to be inline, and Interventional to be slightly above total company base growth. In the Medical segment, we are continuing to extend our leadership position with competitive gains in significant categories such as peripheral catheters and prefilled devices, while investing in solutions transforming healthcare through smart connected care and new care settings. Life Sciences holds leadership positions in attractive and growing categories and is investing in higher-growth spaces by enabling smart, automated laboratory workflows with solutions such as BD COR. Improving chronic disease treatment with clinically differentiated assays, research tools, and companion diagnostics, where we expect continued above market growth in research reagents and migrating point of care diagnostics to alternative care settings. Interventional is continuing its strategy of evolving from product to category leadership in chronic disease treatment, while continuing to invest in accretive high-growth spaces. These investments include increased product offerings, both organic and inorganic, expanded labeling and investments in the non-acute care space. Our PureWay product line and acquisition of Straub Medical are good examples of how we are driving growth for our BDI strategy. Turning to Slide 21 and our guidance for fiscal 2022, we expect base revenues to grow 5% to 6% on an FX neutral basis, compared to $18.3 billion in fiscal 2021. For COVID only testing, we are assuming $200 million in revenue. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency would be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points, or about $100 million to total company revenues. All-in base plus COVID only testing and the illustrative currency, we expect reported revenues in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion in fiscal 2022. We expect operating margins in our base business to improve approximately 200 basis points over fiscal 2021 base operating margin of 21.7%. Due to the current COVID test pricing levels, we expect operating margin on COVID only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models. We expect up to $50 million in improvement in interest/other giving debt refinancing activities we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As you're aware, interest/other can fluctuate due to deferred compensation which is offset in SSG&A. We plan for an increasing effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% given discrete tax items in 2021 will not repeat. And in terms of share count, while priority remains tuck-in M&A, we expect share repurchases to also be a consistent part of value creation. In addition to the year-over-year benefit from share repurchases completed in fiscal 2021 where our ending shares outstanding were $288 million; our guidance assumes share repurchases that at minimum offset any dilution from share-based compensation. All-in, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.30 and $12.50, with EPS excluding COVID only testing being well above the $12 floor we provided in August, on our third quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 22, regarding margins, let me first take a minute to reground everyone on where we are today. There are a few key considerations that have resulted in some margin pressure, some of which will be naturally restored, and others that will be addressed by existing margin improvement programs, with further improvements through new initiatives we are pursuing. Our total operating margin of 23.9% for the full-year did improve versus 2020. In 2021, our total margin profile benefited by over 200 basis points from the COVID-19 testing margin net of investments we made to accelerate growth and other value creating programs. So it's best to look at our base operating margins excluding COVID-19 testing of 21.7%, which also improved on an FX neutral basis versus 2020. However, they do lag pre-pandemic levels as our base operating margin was primarily impacted by four key factors: the Alaris ship hold, negative COVID-19 related volume utilization, above normal inflation in COGS and shipping, along with currency headwinds. Each of these items negatively impacted margin by under 100 basis points, and averaged about 80 basis points each. They collectively accounted for about 90% of the erosion from pre-pandemic levels. The remaining impact was small and driven by a few items including a decision to strategically increase R&D investments to more competitive levels at about 6% of sales to support long-term growth. As I shared, we anticipate improving base operating margins by around 200 basis points in fiscal 2022 driven by the following. First, like all companies we experienced short-term impacts from COVID-19 such as underutilization in our plans. These impacts carried into fiscal 2021 but will be more than fully restored in fiscal 2022 given our strong base sales momentum, and associated increased volumes and will drive about 100 basis points improvement in operating margin versus 2021. Second, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we face the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L along with normal FX translation; the timing of inventory movements throughout our network can also impact our margins. Based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect to recapture about 50 basis points of the currency headwind to operating margin we reported in 2021. Lastly, we realized unprecedented inflationary pressures in fiscal 2021 driven by increased resin, inbound and outbound transportation and labor costs. These inflationary pressures will carry into fiscal 2022, and we intend to be best-in-class in how we navigate this environment. We are expanding our existing simplification efforts; such as project Recode and intend to drive additional margin improvements through new spend optimization initiatives. These include actions across procurement and shipping such as reduced air freight and supplier cost control. In addition, we have actions in place to invest behind continuous improvement in our plants. And inevitably, in this environment, we know, we need to offset these pressures through pricing actions, which are already being implemented. We also are focused on leveraging our SSG&A investments, while maintaining competitive investments in R&D. In 2022, we are forecasting additional impact to operating margin from inflation above normal levels from 2021. However, with a significant progress we've made to-date on margin initiatives that are already underway, we anticipate being able to more than mitigate the incremental inflationary pressures this year to drive an additional 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. Increased utilization, reversing FX pressure and initiatives to offset inflationary pressure will also play a key part in restoring our base gross margin to pre-pandemic levels. Combined we expect these to drive around a 100 basis points improvement. We are committed to delivering against these goals and thus margin improvement will be a key measurement for performance in this year's compensation plan across the company. Our fiscal 2022 operating margin improvement will be a significant step towards recovery of pre-pandemic margin levels. We look forward to sharing more about our longer term margin recovery initiatives next week at our Investor Day, which includes exceeding pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2024. Turning to Slide 23. Our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance reflects the year-over-year decline in COVID only testing profit net of reinvestment. In our base business, as we just discussed, we expect strong operational growth driven by revenue growth and margin improvement, with EPS well above the $12 we provided on our August call. Now turning Slide 24. Our fiscal 2022 guidance also includes our diabetes business. We continue to believe the spin-off is a significant value creating opportunity for our shareholders and both RemainCo and NewCo are well-positioned for success. Let me take a moment to reinforce some key items to make this compelling to all stakeholders. NewCo will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today, with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher growth. The proposed spin enhances RemainCo's revenue and EPS growth profile, as diabetes cares revenue growth is slower than the corporate average and its margins are declining. Carve-out financials will be available with the Form 10. RemainCo is expected to receive a cash distribution equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We plan to provide more details related to the proceeds and intended use at a later date. The spin is intended to be tax free for us federal income tax purposes. And as is normal course for spins, we plan to restate our financials after the spin's effective date to classify the diabetes business as a discontinued operation. Given the higher margin profile of the Diabetes Care business, one should expect RemainCo's margins to be lower as a percent of sales after they're restated but with a higher rate of growth. We are establishing transition services agreement that will offset stranded costs. We remaining cited for what's ahead for NewCo and making this a successful and value creating opportunity for all. Now turning to Slide 25. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to share some phasing considerations for your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be normalized across the quarters with the exception of Q2, where we expect higher growth due to easier comp resulting from the COVID resurgence in Q2 FY 2021, primarily in Interventional. In addition, we expect COVID testing revenue to be weighted towards the first half of the year. Second, we expect gross margin to be lower in the first half given that increased inflation began earlier in fiscal 2021 and the benefit of cost improvement initiatives we have initiated will be on a lag as they flow through inventory. We expect the inflation flow through to inventory to be most prominent in Q2 and improve across the balance of the year. Third, as we move past COVID variability, we expect SSG&A and R&D expense dollars to be fairly rateable by quarter. Fourth, for full-year, for FY 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. This rate includes assumptions around our jurisdictional mix of income and certain potential discrete items. Of course, the timing of realization of discrete items could result in variability in our rate quarter-to-quarter, including a potentially lower Q1 range. In summary, fiscal 2021 was a year marked by significant strategic progress and execution against our key priorities. As we look forward, and as reflected in our 2022 guidance, we are well-positioned for growth, with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement. We are excited to share our long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day. Let me now turn it back to Nadia to lead the Q&A portion of the call.\nNadia Goncalves: Thanks, Chris. Ashley, we're now ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly, the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on a good print this morning, and thanks for taking my question. And Chris, welcome to BD. I guess to start with on the fiscal 2022 guidance here. Maybe a little bit more clarity on what is being assumed for vaccine contribution. And I think you mentioned Alaris pump sales in line with fiscal 2021. Maybe clarify what those numbers are. And on the combo test, is that -- what sort of assumption should we have on ASP for the combo test because I was curious on your pricing comment for COVID in fiscal Q4?\nTom Polen: Yes. Hey, Vijay, good morning. This is Tom. Thanks for the good questions here and make sure I address all of them. So Alaris, as we said, we expect that to be essentially flat to 2020. One thing about that as about $100 million contribution in 2022 and 2021. Put in perspective, that's, as Chris mentioned, that's about 2020 was closer to $300 million. So even in our -- as we think about the 8.1% growth this past year that absorbs about a point of Alaris coming down from the -- when we were getting very large numbers of additional medical necessity orders as people were adding to their fleets. So that's the assumption on Alaris. On vaccines, it's -- we still are towards the high-end of that $100 million to $150 million range that we'd expected for vaccination campaigns. And so we expect that's just kind of part of the MDS business. Now, I don't know if we were going to call that out as a guide in that growth, but we don't see it as a notable headwind in the growth rate of that business in 2022. We still have solid demand for those products. And as we said, we now have visibility to 2 billion units of syringes specifically for COVID vaccines, which we're obviously proud of being able to help deliver 2 billion COVID vaccines around the world. And I think we've shipped about 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion of those so far. So that gives a little bit of color, in terms of how much we left to ship in 2022. On the combo assay, great question. We've got Dave Hickey here, obviously, the President of our Life Sciences businesses. And so let me turn that question over to him.\nDave Hickey: Thank you, Tom. Vijay, thanks for the question. So yes, just to reiterate on the combo. Just to reiterate what Chris has said, right. So if you think about what's come back into the base business for FY 2022, we do expect that as we get into the flu season, the respiratory season for both BD Veritor, and for BD MAX, that these combination tests will be the sort of the go-to test, particularly for people who might be symptomatic. And people who are sort of saying, do I have flu, or do I have COVID. So we do expect that to be the combo test. The installed bases are there to support that testing. And we've put into the range for next year, an estimate of around $75 million to $100 million back into the base business. From a pricing perspective, we do expect it to be a premium price, over the traditional tests as we've indicated; we're just not sharing specific pricing at this time.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Tom I think I heard Chris mention the goal is exciting fiscal 2024 operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels, fiscal 2019 operating margins were 25.3%, so when you say above pre-pandemic, is that the target in -- is exiting fiscal 2024 are you expecting to be above 25.3% or is that the annual goal fiscal 2024 overall margins to be above 25.3%. Maybe just give us some broad strokes on what's the exit there is that Alaris coming back and then base business execution or something else that's being done?\nTom Polen: I'll turn that to Chris, good question. And I think that the exact term you use was above.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, that's right. Yes and thanks for the welcome as well, Vijay. Yes, just to clarify. So you're right, the pre-pandemic level was just over 25% fiscal year 2024 is our target to get above that level. We'll certainly share more next week in terms of specific initiatives. I think the way to think of it is we already had a lot of simplification efforts underway with Project Recode. Those can contribute about $300 million. That's one bucket. In addition to that, I articulated on the call even as it relates to actions we're taking and demonstrated at the end of 2021 and heading into 2022, we're increasing our initiatives, pricing, mix, portfolio optimization, and new initiatives on spend optimization as well. And then certainly, lastly, the Alaris ship hold that was an 80 basis point drag on the business going back to them. So while we're not being committed as it relates to timing, as you think through kind of the longer term timeframe, and that we will share next week, you would expect that to have a benefit over time. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBob Hopkins: Well thank you and good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. And, Chris, welcome. My one -- really only have one question or one topic I wanted to cover. And, Chris, this is probably for you because it seems like a key part of this call is your assumptions on the improvement in base business operating margins from 2021 to 2022. So, a couple of things, I'd love you to comment on Chris if okay. One is I'm struggling a little bit with how to think about the starting point because Q4 base business operating margins are obviously a lot lower than full-year 2021. So maybe help me understand what's the right starting point. And then, secondly, I'd love you to talk a little bit about, how much of that 200 basis point improvement in base business you're assuming for the full-year is gross margin and just what are your assumptions on pricing embedded in that? So there's a lot in there. That's my one question. But I would love you address those things and thank you very much.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Great question. So look I think going forward, we're going to continue to provide transparency as it relates to kind of the base performance of the business. I understand your question as it relates to kind of jump off points as it relates to quarter keep in mind, there were a lot of quarterly fluctuations as we navigated 2020 through COVID and 2021 with inflationary dynamics. I think it's simplest to kind of normalize and just look at things on a full-year basis. So as you think of our operating margins from 2021 of 21.7%, on the base business, there's really a few key drivers. One is we've talked about through this about having our utilization levels impacted due to pandemic, our strong growth profile through 2021 and 2022, we now anticipate being well above in driving almost 100 basis points of utilization upside 2021 to 2022 full-year to full-year. In addition to that last year, we had the impact of currency. There was a headwind on earnings, they got trapped in inventory, and as that bleeds through, we actually have about a 50 basis point improvement heading from 2021 to 2022, that goes through to operating margin. Lastly, where we're investing a lot of our time, of course is navigating the inflationary dynamics. And we talked about the net 50 basis point improvement in terms of outsized inflation, which we would anticipate being north of 200 basis points in full-year 2022 offsetting that will be a series of initiatives. There's not one thing it's actually a very well balanced plan. We have talked about on the call; we're continuing to drive cost improvement in our plans. We're taking enact actions on the procurement side of the business as well in terms of spend. We're looking at things from an SSG&A standpoint as well and leveraging that. And then, yes, there is going to be a strong focus on pricing portfolio mix, driving growth through higher GP areas. And the net of all of those we actually expect a 50 basis point improvement. Maybe lastly, just to give you some color on kind of where we are, because I think this is important. We've entered the year with specific action plans against those goals. So we have risk adjusted plans, very detailed targeted actions to deliver the improvement we need to mitigate against deflation. If you go a step further and look where we are from kind of an execution standpoint, 80% to 90% of those have been fully identified and the plans are moving, and some of them are just more timing dynamics in terms of when we may take price or when we'll evolve our portfolio. And of that number, almost half of that is actually already banked coming into year flowing through our inventory and P&L. Now that's quite a testament to the work that we did in the back half of 2021 and already have strong progress. So we look forward to sharing more as the year progresses, but we feel good about the plan and the progress that we'll achieve through the year.\nOperator: Well take our next question from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Nice quarter and thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Maybe just on the diabetes spin you talked about higher than company margins. Is there any color you could add to how much, and will we have the Form-10 by the Analyst Day next week?\nTom Polen: Go ahead, if you can.\nChris DelOrefice: Hey, Robbie. How are you doing? It's Chris. Yes, as we said, the Form-10 will be later this year. That will -- we don't anticipate that being out by next week. Look, it's a good question. It's premature to share. We have to wait until the Form 10 is out, there will be much more detail there. But I really think the more important dynamic here is, right, this is actually just a portfolio transaction, and there is going to be sort of a reset of margin. And by definition, we had shared that, it is accretive, there will be a reset of margin, but more importantly, it's been diluted to both growth and margin growth, top-line growth and margin growth. So it could be an acceleration from that. And as we get into Investor Day, we can certainly share more as it relates to kind of the longer term impact as it relates to margin. And what I just shared in terms of our longer term margin improvement goals. We still feel really good about where we're going to position margin over time, and all these efforts going against that. And lastly, I think just the value creation opportunity this creates, I talked about the cash infusion of multiple years we get that gives us additional flexibility to think through how to reinvest and utilize those -- that cash infusion we can talk more about that as well over time.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate it. And then maybe just one other, you talked about doing seven acquisitions this year, $500 million total. How do we think about the contribution of those to revenues in 2021 and 2022? And where do you put M&A in terms of capital allocation priority? How do you view the market right now in terms of asset availability and valuations? It'd be great to get your take on that? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yes. Robbie. This is Tom and good morning. So we'll try not to share too much of the thunder from next week, but it's good question. And we'll get more into this, but we've spent about $500 million this year. If you look at the acquisitions that we made last year, think about over the last 20 months or so we've invested about $900 million, that drives about $100 million this year and $200 million next year roughly from those tuck-in M&As. So if you do the math, that's about a little under a five times what we're paying in terms of revenue that we're getting from those acquisitions next year. And as you know, that's good value that we're getting, and we're obviously performing above our cost of capital on those acquisitions. We're clearly at those levels of multiples that were being able to get those assets for, we're not buying growth, we're absolutely growing what we buy leveraging our channels, our global position, our manufacturing capabilities, et cetera to scale these assets in ways that we're uniquely positioned to do so. We'll also share with you next week, the mix of how those breakout into the amount of spend and acquisitions that are going towards kind of that durable core base portfolio that we have versus those more transformative solution areas that I've talked about. Those three categories that we discussed and you'll see the weighting of those. They're highly weighted in high growth markets. That revenue that I described is growing north of double-digits as we go-forward. We continue to see opportunities. As we look ahead, we have a robust funnel. You can expect us to continue to drive that strategy forward. Obviously, it's been important part of why we focus so heavily on cash flow. Actually, if you look at our cash flow over the last two years since 2019, it's grown at 18% CAGR. That's not by accident, we've had very focused programs driving that that's something we're very proud of. And it positions us, as Chris mentioned, to drive a balanced strategy between tuck-in M&A strategy to drive our growth, as well as continue to return value to shareholders, as you've seen us doing so. Thanks for the question, Robbie and looking forward to more discussion next week.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Maybe just to clarify is there any revenues associated with the deals we should be thinking about in the model for next year?\nTom Polen: It's obviously built into our guidance. Chris, any other comments in there?\nChris DelOrefice: No, I think Tom shared the directional right. These were about $100 million in the current year 2021. And we've talked about essentially doubling that. So on an incremental basis, you can think of about another $100 million. So it's a contributor to growth of 30 to 40 bps gives us a lot of confidence in our growth profile, and then the capacity to do more of that over time. We'll certainly talk more about next year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Mishan: Hey, good morning guys and thank you for taking the questions. First, how should we be thinking about the return on the $200 million of investments you guys made from the bolus of COVID testing? And when you'd expect to see some of those happening. And then just were those really one-time costs or successful programs, maybe just folding into more traditional M&A at this point?\nChris DelOrefice: In the context, it's more traditional R&D at this point, sorry.\nTom Polen: Yes, Matthew, this is Tom, good morning. The -- good question. We are not that that spend is done, right. So we're not that's not recurring spend, as we've always communicated that got cutoff last year in Q4. So that is out of our P&L going forward. And we'll share more details actually about exactly where that money was spent. And you'll see throughout the discussions next week at our Investor Day, each of the different businesses highlighting the programs that they've invested in and you'll see how that help to accelerate our growth outlook as we go-forward over the long-term. It is mixed across both innovation as well as accelerating our simplification strategy as well, and we'll share more details on that next week. But there it is balanced across both of those categories. And when we say the growth agenda, how it's balanced on that side, it is majority of the growth money that we're spending is in R&D, but there is money that we spend on expanding channels, so specifically telesales in Europe, non-acute sales channels in the U.S., and you'll hear more about those specific investments from our leaders in the U.S. region and from our European leaders next week as well. And we're excited to be able to share that. I know there's been a -- we've been busy over this last year. We're really proud of the progress that we've made on our strategy. And we're really looking forward to having our leaders share with you those details of that progress next week. Thanks for the question.\nMatthew Mishan: And --\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, go ahead.\nMatthew Mishan: And just on the Pharma Systems business. I think you've announced some, I know that's been a very successful business for you. I think you've announced some capacity additions. I'm wondering when do those capacity additions actually benefit that that area.\nTom Polen: Yes, obviously, it's a great business already. I think we're three or four years of consecutive acceleration in that business. We have Alberto Mas on the line. Maybe Alberto, if you could just comment on when do we start seeing some of that that capacity benefit to business and where that stands.\nAlberto Mas: Yes, hello. Good morning. We're going to see it along the way. So it's not lumpy. It's we're just -- we're just -- what we're going to see in capacity in 2022. In this business, you need about two to three years of advanced planning on these things. So we're going to see it along the way it's not going to be lumpy. So you're going to see that in the next three to four years.\nTom Polen: Great start. Is it fair to say, Alberto, there is a little bit of a benefit of summing that -- some of that business continues to come online. The early phase does come online in the back half of next year?\nAlberto Mas: Or throughout next year that's what I'm trying to say it's think of this as a smooth over the next three or four years. It's going to be coming online quarter-by-quarter.\nMatthew Mishan: Not -- not one?\nTom Polen: Yes. And Matt --\nMatthew Mishan: Yes.\nTom Polen: We see that helping to continue to fuel what is that high single-digit, double-digit growth profile of that business.\nMatthew Mishan: Perfect. That is the reference I was looking for. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next questions from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Welcome, Chris. So one question for Chris, one question for Tom, I'll ask them both now. Chris, maybe I'll ask Bob's question a different way. Can you talk a little bit about the margin in EPS cadence in fiscal 2022, how much below the operating -- the base operating margin of about 23.7%, you expect Q1 to be is 100 basis points, the right way to think about it. And consensus is I think 2.84 for EPS right now. I'd love to get your reaction to that, just to calibrate it correctly to start the year. And, Tom you guys are doing really well in China. There are a lot of investor concerns about multinational companies' ability to continue to grow there, given the value-based purchasing and the recent document 551. How are you feeling about your ability to continue to grow strongly in China and any reaction to some of those initiatives? Thanks for taking the questions guys.\nTom Polen: Start with Chris.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, thanks, Larry. Appreciate the question. Yes, I'll try to amplify some of the color that I provided earlier. So as we think of the year as the year progresses, first from the top-line, just to reiterate, we do actually expect relatively normalized growth with the exception of Q2 like I had shared because of the comparables. And then there's the dynamic of COVID only testing, which you'd expect to be more first half. So I would consider that that dynamic. From a margin standpoint, certainly first half, we anticipate to be lower. This is simply a matter of the inflationary dynamics that started in 2021, rolling through inventory. And the peak of when that rolls through and those costs actually hit is more like Q2. So kind of first half definitely less favorable margins versus the second half and Q2 in particular being kind of the high mark of that low, so to speak. And then obviously as the initiatives that we've already taken again, there's a lot of that banks, right, if you recall had shared about 50% of its already happening. But again, you get the dynamic of it flowing through inventory, so you end up with kind of the second half dynamic in the margin improvement throughout the back half. So the last item was just more of a discretionary tax item, I alluded to that could actually end up with some favorability in Q1, but those are very difficult to predict. So hopefully, that helps some.\nTom Polen: And Larry, this is Tom, thanks for the question and good morning. Great to connect. For China, you're going to hear from James Deng, our President of China actually next week. And so I know he's looking forward to sharing the progress there. As you said, we had a very good year in China this year. And we think we're kind of back to a strong growth rate looking forward, 551 for us, we don't see specific impact in our categories. It's something that we've spent a lot of time talking about. Obviously, we have four plants in China; they're focused almost exclusively in China, for China, and particularly focused in some of the categories that there is more local competition in like catheters, vacutainer tubes, pen needles, et cetera. But we make those businesses, those products, mostly in China, for China as well, so we can compete as a local organization in those. The other thing is we have a record number of new product launches coming out in China over the next three years. You'll hear from Simon and team in China, we're really pleased that we ended 2021 having doubled the size of the bar business in China since acquisition, that was a big focus of ours on revenue synergies. And there continues to be the impact of those registrations that we've been making over the last several years. The impact of those will be continuing to rollout with new launches as we look forward. I know again, Simon will talk next week, maybe share a couple of comments now on some of the launches that you're having in China that are occurring. So we feel good about the outlook for China. We're -- as all we're watching the situation very cautiously being prudent in our investments there. But we've got a great team, we saw strong performance this year and we do have a strong outlook in China for the next year as well.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So just some color, over the next three years, the Interventional segment expect to commercialize further 22 to 25 new products in China. And just an example of how we've been successful there in addition to what Tom said about doubling our business, but we recently just got approval or clearance for our Targeted Temperature Management technology in China. And we've actually just got our first two purchase orders this month from that, at margins that are creative to BDI, to BDX, and the sustained, and I would say prolific growth of our business in China. We expect to continue over the next period of time.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just have one, sorry to keep focusing on the margin progression here, but wanted to better understand the impact in fiscal 2021. And then how to think about the impact in fiscal 2022 of China value-based pricing. I felt like that was a bucket that was called out on the third quarter call as a big headwind for margin and this year. I just wanted to understand better the impact this year and whether that with all the positive momentum you're experiencing, whether that turns into a margin tailwind in fiscal 2022. Thanks for taking the question.\nTom Polen: Hey, Josh, maybe you just let me comment on value-based procurement. I'll turn it over to Chris for other items. We saw the bigger impact of VBP kind of is behind us. There is still some impact going forward, but like the business and the market is China is challenged with restructuring their cost base to manage through any of that. And so and that's exactly what they've been doing is restructuring cost base, as we think about that going forward to offset those headwind. So maybe Chris any other comments?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, no, Josh, I would just add that yes, it was an impact that was previously discussed. It was smaller relative to the main drivers that I framed as it relates to the progression from 2019 to 2021. And we always are doing continuous cost improvement initiatives that offset some of these things that happen. As Tom noted, China is well-positioned and we're thinking of that market more holistically. There is strong double-digit growth in 2021, actually at over 20%. And so when you think of it from a total portfolio standpoint, we feel real -- nicely positioned as it relates to both a growth profile, and then have nice actually margin enhancement as a result of that as we go-forward. So thanks Josh.\nOperator: Your final question will come from Matthew Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Polen: Hi, Matt. Good morning.\nMatthew Taylor: Hey, good morning, Tom. How you doing?\nTom Polen: Good.\nMatthew Taylor: Good, good. And Chris, welcome. Congrats on your new role at BD. So just wanted to ask two questions that are kind of related. Just conceptually when you gave us the update in the $12 floor a few months ago, could you just talk about, what's changed to give you the confidence to now put out the guidance in the mid-$12 range, and how things have developed here over the last couple of months?\nTom Polen: Okay, sure. I'll turn that to Chris.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, thanks -- thanks Matt. Appreciate the question. Look, I think, it really starts with our focus on growth. I think a strong base growth profile that we guided on, coupled with if you look at the cash flow that we shared through 2021, that gives us a lot of flexibility on tuck-in M&A, right. So we have strong organic growth profile, the enhancement we're making to our R&D portfolio. And then that coupled with the tuck-in M&A capability that we will now be able to have on an ongoing basis. Tom earlier talked about the acceleration of deals that we've done recently, those alone can contribute about 40 basis points to growth. So one, I think, there is just a very strong growth profile there. Two, is just the disciplined focus on margin improvement. We knew that was something to focus on in addition to the cash management approach we've taken over time, that's enhanced growth. And so those are the two main drivers. As a matter of fact, we're actually cycling over a headwind on tax. That's been offset by some of the capital deployment we've been able to put at work with share repurchases. So you'll see us be more disciplined there with other value creating levers too due to the strong cash flow that we have.\nTom Polen: Maybe also we're finishing the year full stronger, right than what we thought at the time. So we're -- we had a really strong Q4. We're seeing that that strong demand in our base business. So we're going in. The beat that we're seeing here is a combination of not only stronger COVID diagnostics, but stronger performance in our base business as we wrap up the year. So I think that's an important point to -- a contributor to that as well.\nChris DelOrefice: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Taylor: Okay. Thanks for that confidence answer.\nTom Polen: Okay. Well, operator, if there's no more --\nOperator: Well at this time --\nTom Polen: I'm sorry, go ahead.\nOperator: Sir, I apologize. I just was going to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for any closing remarks.\nTom Polen: I just thanks everyone for the good discussion today. We obviously are really looking forward to discussing all the great work that the team has been doing here over the last 20 plus months as we've been advancing our BD 2025 strategy. I personally I'm really excited to -- for next week's event. We're going to be able to share with you where we've been investing, how we've been refining, and making significant changes in our portfolio to optimize growth and margins. And you'll hear from a wide range of leaders on how they're executing and bringing to life our 2025 strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders next week. So everyone stay well, and we'll look forward to continue great dialogue next week. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thank you, Nadia, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before I get started, I would like to officially welcome Chris DelOrefice, BD's recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. Chris brings deep healthcare and MedTech experience to BD across both operations and corporate finance. Many of you already know Chris from his most recent role as Head of Investor Relations at J&J. We were thrilled to have Chris join the team and while he's only been with us for two months, he's already immersing himself and making a very positive impact. I look forward to Chris sharing his perspective with you both today and at our Investor Day next week. I would also like to welcome Dr. Carrie Byington, who is recently appointed to the BD Board of Directors. Dr. Byington is Executive Vice President and Head of University of California Health, where she leads the nation's largest academic health system. Dr. Byington brings deep and highly relevant experience to BD, as we work to advance our BD 2025 strategy and accelerate innovation in smart connected care, enabling the transition to new care settings, and improving chronic disease outcomes. On today's call, I will provide highlights of our performance and the continued progress we've made on our BD 2025 strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook for fiscal 2022. After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will open the call up for Q&A. Now let's jump into our results and key highlights for the year on Slide 7. We were very pleased with the strong close to fiscal 2021, which drove full-year revenues, EPS and cash flows ahead of our expectations despite a volatile environment. This reflects our continued laser-focus on execution and the strength and expansiveness of our diversified business and geographic model. Revenues grew over 15% to more than $20 billion in fiscal 2021, with $2 billion in COVID testing revenues and strong 8.1% growth in our base business. Our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $13.08. And through continued execution of cash flow initiatives we instituted in fiscal 2020, we further improved our operating cash flow by over $1.1 billion compared to the prior-year. Overall performance reflects strong momentum in our base business with a return to more normalized growth rates across all three segments versus pre-pandemic revenue level. As hospitals have been able to return to serving both COVID and non-COVID patients, and the overall healthcare utilization levels increased, we saw a strong demand for our broad portfolio of products that were essential to patient care, including new products delivered across our innovation pipeline. At the same time, we were proud to have supported our customers and the patients they serve, by bringing to market and scaling a broad range of innovations to help the world diagnose, treat, and prevent COVID. Turning to Slide 8, at the highest level, our strategy has been deeply rooted in helping healthcare systems balance four key priorities. And those are improving outcomes, driving efficiencies, expanding access to care, and more important than ever, improving the clinician experience. BD is uniquely positioned to help our customers deliver against these three key priorities across discovery and diagnosis, medication delivery, and interventional treatment. And through our innovation-driven growth strategy, we're investing in our broad, foundational durable core portfolio, while also shifting a larger portion of our business into higher growth, higher impact areas. And those three higher growth higher impact areas that we're focused on, you've heard me talk about before are smart connected care, enabling the transition of treatments in new care settings, and improving chronic disease outcomes. In addition, by simplifying our product portfolio, we're driving growth through increased efficiency and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 9. Importantly, we significantly advanced our strategy this past fiscal year, taking bold steps to position BD for the long-term. Beginning with the actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our working capital and cash flows. These actions have positioned our cash and net leverage well. Giving us the capacity to increase investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, accelerating our innovation pipeline, and advancing our strategy to drive growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. In FY 2021, we invested over $1.2 billion in R&D, 21% more than last year, with increased funding for key projects through our new growth and innovation fund. We also continued our increased pace of tuck-in acquisitions, completing seven acquisitions in fiscal 2021, as well as a number of additional early phase investments as we also began to build our long-term inorganic funnel. In addition, we reinvested over $200 million in profits from COVID testing to drive our growth strategy. Through investments in our commercial organizations indeed and accelerate our simplification strategy by investing to speed up our recode portfolio and architecture program. And today, these investments are meaningfully advancing our strategy to expand in higher-growth spaces, across smart connected care, new care settings, and chronic disease outcomes. And just a few recent accomplishments that I can share here underscore our growing momentum. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more of those accomplishments next week at Analyst Day. These include new manufacturing lines that are now operational and will support demand for vaccination devices globally. And this investment is in addition to our $1.2 billion commitment to expand capacity for our pre-fillable syringe, and advanced drug delivery systems, which represent high-growth opportunities in our durable core. Emergency used authorization for BD Veritor At-Home, which is the first at-home COVID antigen test to use a smartphone to interpret and report results. This platform is a great example of how we're applying digital capabilities to bring new first to world innovations to market and expanding care to new settings. We also received 510(k) clearance of expanded indications for Rotarex Atherectomy System to include treatment of in-stent restenosis, which is a first of its kind label expansion and it's a great example of how we expand optionality for physicians and customers in the treatment of chronic disease. We also received U.S. FDA approval of our new high throughput molecular system BD COR. In today's challenging labor environment, BD COR's advanced robotics and software algorithms provide customers a way to do more testing with less available staff while providing important new clinical insights for cervical cancer screening and management through our BD Onclarity, HPV Assay. Now beyond BD COR, as you know, we have a portfolio and pipeline of unique automated solutions that help our customers perform in a tight labor market from helping nursing staff and pharmacists be more efficient with medication management, to increasing efficiency in diagnostic testing for labs experiencing staffing shortages. We're engaging with customers in these markets and are seeing great interest in our solutions. At our Investor Day, we'll share more about how we are well-positioned, not only capitalize on this opportunity, but how we've been very actively optimizing our investment mix to both expand our durable core platforms and simultaneously add technology and platform innovation in higher-impact and higher-growth spaces that we expect to enhance our long-term growth profile. Through our disciplined capital allocation framework, we're balancing these investments and future growth with a return of capital to shareholders through our competitive dividend, while also resuming our share repurchasing program, having repurchased $1.75 billion in fiscal 2021. We also just announced our 50th consecutive year of dividend increases, and we're very proud to be one of only 16 companies across all industries to achieve that milestone. Turing to Slide 10. We'll remain disciplined in our approach to portfolio management as we systematically advance and deliver against our strategy. And earlier this year, we announced the decision to spin-off our diabetes care business. The proposed spin represents a value creation opportunity for all stakeholders and is intended to enable growth acceleration for both BD RemainCo and NewCo with more efficient business processes and allocation of resources and capital. NewCo will be able to invest its capital in growth opportunities, including high-growth geographies markets and next-generation products. We continue to make good progress and the spin-off remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. Regarding our BD Alaris pump, we recently received CE mark and Health Canada approval for the updated BD Alaris system. We also achieved a significant milestone earlier this year with the filing of our BD Alaris 510(k) submission. We have dedicated resources supporting this and continue to make progress. Alaris is an important tool for clinicians and there continues to be strong demand for our platform during the pandemic. Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to share some details about our enhanced ESG strategy Together We Advance. BD has been a longstanding leader as a case study for sustainable business models and innovating for shared value. Our strategy serves as a framework through which BD addresses the most relevant ESG issues for the company and its stakeholders and aims to further our leadership role and build on our commitment to improve and advance individual and public health at a global scale. The health of our company, our planet, our communities, and the people we serve are directly connected. And when we successfully address the health of one, we often solve for challenges of another. And under our strategy, we announced the suite of goals for 2030 and beyond with commitments in five areas that are most important to BD and our stakeholders, and where we have opportunities to create meaningful measured change over the next decade. And those specifically are climate change, product impacts, responsible supply chains, healthy workforce, and communities and transparency. And we're acting on these commitments. And for example, we recently signed on to the United Nations Race To Zero campaign. We look forward to sharing more about the advances and impact we having in each of these areas. Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look ahead, we expect the greater resiliency exhibited by healthcare systems during Delta will continue along with continued recovery and patient demand post-Delta. While there are inflationary pressures occurring across most every industry, we have been very active in addressing these challenges. We have put specific defined actionable plans in place to help mitigate these pressures, which are coordinated through an inflation taskforce that we've established with work streams across procurement, shipping, cost structure, and continuous improvements in our plans. And in this environment, it's also required to initiate pricing actions, which we have begun. Looking ahead, while we believe there will be longer term macro solutions like expanded shipping and resin capacity. We're not waiting for those to occur. Our aim is to be best-in-class in navigating the current environment. We believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery. We're proud of the progress we're making advancing our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. We have excellent momentum in our base business heading into fiscal 2022, a stronger balance sheet, and steadily increasing cash flows, despite inflationary pressures, all positioning us well for the future. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. And again, Chris, welcome. Yes. Hey, Vijay, good morning. This is Tom. Thanks for the good questions here and make sure I address all of them. So Alaris, as we said, we expect that to be essentially flat to 2020. One thing about that as about $100 million contribution in 2022 and 2021. Put in perspective, that's, as Chris mentioned, that's about 2020 was closer to $300 million. So even in our -- as we think about the 8.1% growth this past year that absorbs about a point of Alaris coming down from the -- when we were getting very large numbers of additional medical necessity orders as people were adding to their fleets. So that's the assumption on Alaris. On vaccines, it's -- we still are towards the high-end of that $100 million to $150 million range that we'd expected for vaccination campaigns. And so we expect that's just kind of part of the MDS business. Now, I don't know if we were going to call that out as a guide in that growth, but we don't see it as a notable headwind in the growth rate of that business in 2022. We still have solid demand for those products. And as we said, we now have visibility to 2 billion units of syringes specifically for COVID vaccines, which we're obviously proud of being able to help deliver 2 billion COVID vaccines around the world. And I think we've shipped about 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion of those so far. So that gives a little bit of color, in terms of how much we left to ship in 2022. On the combo assay, great question. We've got Dave Hickey here, obviously, the President of our Life Sciences businesses. And so let me turn that question over to him. I'll turn that to Chris, good question. And I think that the exact term you use was above. Go ahead, if you can. Yes. Robbie. This is Tom and good morning. So we'll try not to share too much of the thunder from next week, but it's good question. And we'll get more into this, but we've spent about $500 million this year. If you look at the acquisitions that we made last year, think about over the last 20 months or so we've invested about $900 million, that drives about $100 million this year and $200 million next year roughly from those tuck-in M&As. So if you do the math, that's about a little under a five times what we're paying in terms of revenue that we're getting from those acquisitions next year. And as you know, that's good value that we're getting, and we're obviously performing above our cost of capital on those acquisitions. We're clearly at those levels of multiples that were being able to get those assets for, we're not buying growth, we're absolutely growing what we buy leveraging our channels, our global position, our manufacturing capabilities, et cetera to scale these assets in ways that we're uniquely positioned to do so. We'll also share with you next week, the mix of how those breakout into the amount of spend and acquisitions that are going towards kind of that durable core base portfolio that we have versus those more transformative solution areas that I've talked about. Those three categories that we discussed and you'll see the weighting of those. They're highly weighted in high growth markets. That revenue that I described is growing north of double-digits as we go-forward. We continue to see opportunities. As we look ahead, we have a robust funnel. You can expect us to continue to drive that strategy forward. Obviously, it's been important part of why we focus so heavily on cash flow. Actually, if you look at our cash flow over the last two years since 2019, it's grown at 18% CAGR. That's not by accident, we've had very focused programs driving that that's something we're very proud of. And it positions us, as Chris mentioned, to drive a balanced strategy between tuck-in M&A strategy to drive our growth, as well as continue to return value to shareholders, as you've seen us doing so. Thanks for the question, Robbie and looking forward to more discussion next week. It's obviously built into our guidance. Chris, any other comments in there? Yes, Matthew, this is Tom, good morning. The -- good question. We are not that that spend is done, right. So we're not that's not recurring spend, as we've always communicated that got cutoff last year in Q4. So that is out of our P&L going forward. And we'll share more details actually about exactly where that money was spent. And you'll see throughout the discussions next week at our Investor Day, each of the different businesses highlighting the programs that they've invested in and you'll see how that help to accelerate our growth outlook as we go-forward over the long-term. It is mixed across both innovation as well as accelerating our simplification strategy as well, and we'll share more details on that next week. But there it is balanced across both of those categories. And when we say the growth agenda, how it's balanced on that side, it is majority of the growth money that we're spending is in R&D, but there is money that we spend on expanding channels, so specifically telesales in Europe, non-acute sales channels in the U.S., and you'll hear more about those specific investments from our leaders in the U.S. region and from our European leaders next week as well. And we're excited to be able to share that. I know there's been a -- we've been busy over this last year. We're really proud of the progress that we've made on our strategy. And we're really looking forward to having our leaders share with you those details of that progress next week. Thanks for the question. Yes, obviously, it's a great business already. I think we're three or four years of consecutive acceleration in that business. We have Alberto Mas on the line. Maybe Alberto, if you could just comment on when do we start seeing some of that that capacity benefit to business and where that stands. Great start. Is it fair to say, Alberto, there is a little bit of a benefit of summing that -- some of that business continues to come online. The early phase does come online in the back half of next year? Yes. And Matt -- We see that helping to continue to fuel what is that high single-digit, double-digit growth profile of that business. Start with Chris. And Larry, this is Tom, thanks for the question and good morning. Great to connect. For China, you're going to hear from James Deng, our President of China actually next week. And so I know he's looking forward to sharing the progress there. As you said, we had a very good year in China this year. And we think we're kind of back to a strong growth rate looking forward, 551 for us, we don't see specific impact in our categories. It's something that we've spent a lot of time talking about. Obviously, we have four plants in China; they're focused almost exclusively in China, for China, and particularly focused in some of the categories that there is more local competition in like catheters, vacutainer tubes, pen needles, et cetera. But we make those businesses, those products, mostly in China, for China as well, so we can compete as a local organization in those. The other thing is we have a record number of new product launches coming out in China over the next three years. You'll hear from Simon and team in China, we're really pleased that we ended 2021 having doubled the size of the bar business in China since acquisition, that was a big focus of ours on revenue synergies. And there continues to be the impact of those registrations that we've been making over the last several years. The impact of those will be continuing to rollout with new launches as we look forward. I know again, Simon will talk next week, maybe share a couple of comments now on some of the launches that you're having in China that are occurring. So we feel good about the outlook for China. We're -- as all we're watching the situation very cautiously being prudent in our investments there. But we've got a great team, we saw strong performance this year and we do have a strong outlook in China for the next year as well. Thanks, Chris. Hey, Josh, maybe you just let me comment on value-based procurement. I'll turn it over to Chris for other items. We saw the bigger impact of VBP kind of is behind us. There is still some impact going forward, but like the business and the market is China is challenged with restructuring their cost base to manage through any of that. And so and that's exactly what they've been doing is restructuring cost base, as we think about that going forward to offset those headwind. So maybe Chris any other comments? Hi, Matt. Good morning. Good. Okay, sure. I'll turn that to Chris. Maybe also we're finishing the year full stronger, right than what we thought at the time. So we're -- we had a really strong Q4. We're seeing that that strong demand in our base business. So we're going in. The beat that we're seeing here is a combination of not only stronger COVID diagnostics, but stronger performance in our base business as we wrap up the year. So I think that's an important point to -- a contributor to that as well. Okay. Well, operator, if there's no more -- I'm sorry, go ahead. I just thanks everyone for the good discussion today. We obviously are really looking forward to discussing all the great work that the team has been doing here over the last 20 plus months as we've been advancing our BD 2025 strategy. I personally I'm really excited to -- for next week's event. We're going to be able to share with you where we've been investing, how we've been refining, and making significant changes in our portfolio to optimize growth and margins. And you'll hear from a wide range of leaders on how they're executing and bringing to life our 2025 strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders next week. So everyone stay well, and we'll look forward to continue great dialogue next week. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Vijay, thanks for the question. So yes, just to reiterate on the combo. Just to reiterate what Chris has said, right. So if you think about what's come back into the base business for FY 2022, we do expect that as we get into the flu season, the respiratory season for both BD Veritor, and for BD MAX, that these combination tests will be the sort of the go-to test, particularly for people who might be symptomatic. And people who are sort of saying, do I have flu, or do I have COVID. So we do expect that to be the combo test. The installed bases are there to support that testing. And we've put into the range for next year, an estimate of around $75 million to $100 million back into the base business. From a pricing perspective, we do expect it to be a premium price, over the traditional tests as we've indicated; we're just not sharing specific pricing at this time."

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Before I jump in, let me first say I couldn't be more excited about joining BD. BD is a purpose-driven company that has both a deep and broad portfolio that includes leadership positions, many important areas in healthcare. Combined with our innovative pipeline of products and solutions, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape the delivery of healthcare and make a meaningful impact on healthcare outcomes around the world. I look forward to engaging with the investment community next week during our Investor Day, and sharing more specifics around our strategy and the actions we are taking to support our growth agenda and deliver long-term value. So with that, let's get into our results. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered on our commitments in 2021, have strong momentum as we enter 2022, and we're well-positioned for the future. Slide 13 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.1 billion increased 7.3% on a reported basis, and 5.9% on an FX neutral basis. And we're ahead of our expectations. Our base business revenues increased 9.8% driven by strong performance across all three segments. In Q4, we saw continued improvement in overall healthcare utilization levels and routine testing and lab activity and higher acuity. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations. For the full fiscal year, our revenues grew 15.6% or 8.1%, excluding COVID testing, which demonstrates the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy across our segments with base growth of 6.8% in the Medical segment, 8.4% in Life Sciences, and 10.7% in the Interventional segment. Base business growth was also strong regionally, particularly in the U.S., China and Latin America. Compared to fiscal 2019, base business revenues grew 4.5% or about 7% when adjusting for the Alaris ship hold. Turning to Slide 14, our Medical segment delivered $2.5 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter growing 7.7% led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses. MDS revenues increased 11.3% and reflects strong demand for our core products, driven by higher acuity, and increased utilization in the U.S. and Europe and competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. In MMS, Q4 revenues were comparable to the prior-year despite the high number of infusion pump placements in Europe last year to support hospital needs. We continue to see solid growth in our dispensing platform and a high number of committed contracts with Q4 being one of our strongest quarters to-date for committed contracts. Revenue growth of 5.4% in diabetes care benefited from the timing associated with certain sales and slightly better than expected market demand. On a normalized basis, we see diabetes growth about flat. Pharm systems growth of 12.3% reflects continued strong growth driven by demand for our prefilled devices and enabled by capacity expansion. Demand for prefilled devices is being aided by the fast-paced vial to prefilled device conversion for biologics, vaccines, and other injectable drugs. Turning to Slide 15, BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter increasing 1.5%. However excluding COVID testing, Life Sciences grew 15.8%. Performance reflects strong double-digit growth in our base business in both Integrated Diagnostics Solutions and Biosciences, partially offset by declining COVID testing revenues. In IDS, 16.2% growth in the base business was driven by specimen management and microbiology, lab utilization improved, and demand increased for both core products and products used during the care of COVID patients. We're also seeing strong growth in sales of BD MAX IVD assays, which were up about 20% year-over-year. IDS base revenues also included sales of our combination fluid COVID assays for both Veritor and BD MAX that began shipping in Q4. Early demand is robust, and we believe the combination test will become the standard of care for symptomatic testing across laboratory and point of care testing as we enter the flu season. Despite increased demand driven by the Delta variant, and shipping our highest quarterly volume of over 30 million tests, COVID testing revenues declined in Q4 from $452 million to $316 million due to lower pricing in the market. Biosciences revenues increased 14.6% driven by research solutions, as lab utilization is returning to normal levels. We continue to see solid demand for research reagents globally. Our recently launched e-commerce site is a new vehicle for growth and has been well received with strong traffic. Turning to Slide 16, BD Interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter growing 8.3%. As we previously communicated, we began to see an impact on the Delta variant on elective procedures in certain U.S. states in July and August. While we contemplated some continuation of that impact, it was slightly greater than anticipated in our surgery and Peripheral Intervention businesses as hospitals reduced access and restricted elective procedures. Our surgery business grew 16.8%, reflecting the year-over-year recovery in elective procedures, with double-digit growth in infection prevention and biosurgery and strength in hernia despite some impacts from the Delta variant. Growth in infection prevention also reflects continued market adoption of our sterile ChloraPrep product. Revenues in Peripheral Intervention increased 5.5%. We saw continued strong performance in atherectomy as we have leveraged the capabilities of RPI sales force and an oncology as more people completed cancer screenings. PI also continues to be impacted by a product recall which impacted growth by about 300 basis points. Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 3.8% driven by continued strong demand for PureWick, as well as continued adoption of the recently launched Arctic Sun with our Targeted Temperature Management platform. Partially offsetting this growth was a temporary supply disruption within acute urology that is now remedy. We expect shipments to be caught up within the first quarter of FY 2022. For the full fiscal year in 2021, UCC grew 7.6%. Turning to Slide 17, and our Q4 and full-year adjusted P&L. For the quarter we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations, with net income of $770 million and diluted EPS of $2.59. On a currency neutral basis, net income declined 7.8% primarily by lower COVID testing pricing and testing-related one-time costs and reinvestment in the business, as well as higher shipping costs due to inflation, and increased R&D levels. EPS declined slightly less, or 6.5% reflecting a lower share count due to share repurchases. Our full-year adjusted net income and EPS were $3.9 billion and $13.08 respectively, with growth of 31% and 28% driven by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points on an FX neutral basis. We delivered Q4 and full-year operating margins in line with the expectations we previously communicated for the company and for the base business. Turning to Slide 18, cash flows from operations totaled $4.6 billion in fiscal 2021, an increase of over 30% versus fiscal 2020. This improvement in our cash flow has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in capital, R&D, and M&A. During fiscal 2021 we invested in capital expenditures to support high-growth opportunities, including the new manufacturing lines Tom previously mentioned. In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested $500 million in tucking M&A across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond. Beyond our investments in growth, we returned capital to shareholders through $1 billion in dividends and $1.7 billion in share repurchases. We ended the fiscal year with $2.3 billion in cash, and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.6 times. Our current cash and leverage position gives us flexibility to create value through multiple levers. And I look forward to sharing more with you about our capital allocation strategy to our upcoming Investor Day. Now turning to our fiscal 2022 guidance on Slide 20. First the macro assumptions that support our guidance range. While we recognize there will continue to be some variability, we assume there will be continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions as vaccination rates continue to increase and not expect to see continued stabilization of procedures and are not assuming significant disruptions to procedure volumes. Additionally, while we do not expect conditions to return to normal levels, we do not anticipate worsening macro supply chain constraints or inflationary pressures. Finally, we have not assumed any impact of legislation changes that would impact the broader market. Given a significant sales and income generated from testing in fiscal 2021, we previously provided a preliminary guidance score that excluded testing to help you model our underlying base business performance, we will continue to provide our revenue guidance split between base and COVID only testing through this year, along with context regarding testing margins relative to our base business. So a few specific comments on testing assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays at a level comparable to a normal flu season, which you should think of as $75 million to $100 million. For COVID only testing, which is in addition to our base business combo test revenues, we assume the demand would be significantly less in fiscal 2022. Given the variability in the COVID environment driven by uncertainty around the length and intensity of break to outbreaks, our current assumptions are largely based on confirmed orders. We are assuming about $200 million of COVID only testing revenue. If testing revenues were to be substantially higher, we first would compensate for any resulting procedure softness impacting our base revenue and income, which positions as well to manage through this period of uncertainty. Any further upside would be used to create value through either reinvestment or allowing incremental profits to flow through. Regarding Alaris, as Tom noted, we are confident in the progress we were making and the resources that we've invested behind this program. As we previously shared infusion pump clearances are inherently complex, particularly our filing and not so would not be prudent to predict timelines. Consistent with what we share previously, we do not expect and our guidance does not include a 510(k) clearance in fiscal 2022. Additionally, it is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. But at this time we've assumed that our Alaris Capital revenues will be generally in line with fiscal year of 2021. Let me now share some perspective on what is underlying our base guidance. We are well-positioned for strong growth across our three segments with a balanced and robust innovation pipeline resulting from investments in increased productivity in R&D. Growth will be further enabled by the strategic acquisitions we've added to our portfolio that are positioned in high-growth categories. While we aren't providing segment specific guidance relative to total company base growth, we do expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below, Life Sciences growth to be inline, and Interventional to be slightly above total company base growth. In the Medical segment, we are continuing to extend our leadership position with competitive gains in significant categories such as peripheral catheters and prefilled devices, while investing in solutions transforming healthcare through smart connected care and new care settings. Life Sciences holds leadership positions in attractive and growing categories and is investing in higher-growth spaces by enabling smart, automated laboratory workflows with solutions such as BD COR. Improving chronic disease treatment with clinically differentiated assays, research tools, and companion diagnostics, where we expect continued above market growth in research reagents and migrating point of care diagnostics to alternative care settings. Interventional is continuing its strategy of evolving from product to category leadership in chronic disease treatment, while continuing to invest in accretive high-growth spaces. These investments include increased product offerings, both organic and inorganic, expanded labeling and investments in the non-acute care space. Our PureWay product line and acquisition of Straub Medical are good examples of how we are driving growth for our BDI strategy. Turning to Slide 21 and our guidance for fiscal 2022, we expect base revenues to grow 5% to 6% on an FX neutral basis, compared to $18.3 billion in fiscal 2021. For COVID only testing, we are assuming $200 million in revenue. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency would be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points, or about $100 million to total company revenues. All-in base plus COVID only testing and the illustrative currency, we expect reported revenues in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion in fiscal 2022. We expect operating margins in our base business to improve approximately 200 basis points over fiscal 2021 base operating margin of 21.7%. Due to the current COVID test pricing levels, we expect operating margin on COVID only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models. We expect up to $50 million in improvement in interest/other giving debt refinancing activities we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As you're aware, interest/other can fluctuate due to deferred compensation which is offset in SSG&A. We plan for an increasing effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% given discrete tax items in 2021 will not repeat. And in terms of share count, while priority remains tuck-in M&A, we expect share repurchases to also be a consistent part of value creation. In addition to the year-over-year benefit from share repurchases completed in fiscal 2021 where our ending shares outstanding were $288 million; our guidance assumes share repurchases that at minimum offset any dilution from share-based compensation. All-in, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.30 and $12.50, with EPS excluding COVID only testing being well above the $12 floor we provided in August, on our third quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 22, regarding margins, let me first take a minute to reground everyone on where we are today. There are a few key considerations that have resulted in some margin pressure, some of which will be naturally restored, and others that will be addressed by existing margin improvement programs, with further improvements through new initiatives we are pursuing. Our total operating margin of 23.9% for the full-year did improve versus 2020. In 2021, our total margin profile benefited by over 200 basis points from the COVID-19 testing margin net of investments we made to accelerate growth and other value creating programs. So it's best to look at our base operating margins excluding COVID-19 testing of 21.7%, which also improved on an FX neutral basis versus 2020. However, they do lag pre-pandemic levels as our base operating margin was primarily impacted by four key factors: the Alaris ship hold, negative COVID-19 related volume utilization, above normal inflation in COGS and shipping, along with currency headwinds. Each of these items negatively impacted margin by under 100 basis points, and averaged about 80 basis points each. They collectively accounted for about 90% of the erosion from pre-pandemic levels. The remaining impact was small and driven by a few items including a decision to strategically increase R&D investments to more competitive levels at about 6% of sales to support long-term growth. As I shared, we anticipate improving base operating margins by around 200 basis points in fiscal 2022 driven by the following. First, like all companies we experienced short-term impacts from COVID-19 such as underutilization in our plans. These impacts carried into fiscal 2021 but will be more than fully restored in fiscal 2022 given our strong base sales momentum, and associated increased volumes and will drive about 100 basis points improvement in operating margin versus 2021. Second, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we face the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L along with normal FX translation; the timing of inventory movements throughout our network can also impact our margins. Based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect to recapture about 50 basis points of the currency headwind to operating margin we reported in 2021. Lastly, we realized unprecedented inflationary pressures in fiscal 2021 driven by increased resin, inbound and outbound transportation and labor costs. These inflationary pressures will carry into fiscal 2022, and we intend to be best-in-class in how we navigate this environment. We are expanding our existing simplification efforts; such as project Recode and intend to drive additional margin improvements through new spend optimization initiatives. These include actions across procurement and shipping such as reduced air freight and supplier cost control. In addition, we have actions in place to invest behind continuous improvement in our plants. And inevitably, in this environment, we know, we need to offset these pressures through pricing actions, which are already being implemented. We also are focused on leveraging our SSG&A investments, while maintaining competitive investments in R&D. In 2022, we are forecasting additional impact to operating margin from inflation above normal levels from 2021. However, with a significant progress we've made to-date on margin initiatives that are already underway, we anticipate being able to more than mitigate the incremental inflationary pressures this year to drive an additional 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. Increased utilization, reversing FX pressure and initiatives to offset inflationary pressure will also play a key part in restoring our base gross margin to pre-pandemic levels. Combined we expect these to drive around a 100 basis points improvement. We are committed to delivering against these goals and thus margin improvement will be a key measurement for performance in this year's compensation plan across the company. Our fiscal 2022 operating margin improvement will be a significant step towards recovery of pre-pandemic margin levels. We look forward to sharing more about our longer term margin recovery initiatives next week at our Investor Day, which includes exceeding pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2024. Turning to Slide 23. Our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance reflects the year-over-year decline in COVID only testing profit net of reinvestment. In our base business, as we just discussed, we expect strong operational growth driven by revenue growth and margin improvement, with EPS well above the $12 we provided on our August call. Now turning Slide 24. Our fiscal 2022 guidance also includes our diabetes business. We continue to believe the spin-off is a significant value creating opportunity for our shareholders and both RemainCo and NewCo are well-positioned for success. Let me take a moment to reinforce some key items to make this compelling to all stakeholders. NewCo will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today, with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher growth. The proposed spin enhances RemainCo's revenue and EPS growth profile, as diabetes cares revenue growth is slower than the corporate average and its margins are declining. Carve-out financials will be available with the Form 10. RemainCo is expected to receive a cash distribution equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We plan to provide more details related to the proceeds and intended use at a later date. The spin is intended to be tax free for us federal income tax purposes. And as is normal course for spins, we plan to restate our financials after the spin's effective date to classify the diabetes business as a discontinued operation. Given the higher margin profile of the Diabetes Care business, one should expect RemainCo's margins to be lower as a percent of sales after they're restated but with a higher rate of growth. We are establishing transition services agreement that will offset stranded costs. We remaining cited for what's ahead for NewCo and making this a successful and value creating opportunity for all. Now turning to Slide 25. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to share some phasing considerations for your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be normalized across the quarters with the exception of Q2, where we expect higher growth due to easier comp resulting from the COVID resurgence in Q2 FY 2021, primarily in Interventional. In addition, we expect COVID testing revenue to be weighted towards the first half of the year. Second, we expect gross margin to be lower in the first half given that increased inflation began earlier in fiscal 2021 and the benefit of cost improvement initiatives we have initiated will be on a lag as they flow through inventory. We expect the inflation flow through to inventory to be most prominent in Q2 and improve across the balance of the year. Third, as we move past COVID variability, we expect SSG&A and R&D expense dollars to be fairly rateable by quarter. Fourth, for full-year, for FY 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. This rate includes assumptions around our jurisdictional mix of income and certain potential discrete items. Of course, the timing of realization of discrete items could result in variability in our rate quarter-to-quarter, including a potentially lower Q1 range. In summary, fiscal 2021 was a year marked by significant strategic progress and execution against our key priorities. As we look forward, and as reflected in our 2022 guidance, we are well-positioned for growth, with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement. We are excited to share our long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day. Let me now turn it back to Nadia to lead the Q&A portion of the call. Yes, that's right. Yes and thanks for the welcome as well, Vijay. Yes, just to clarify. So you're right, the pre-pandemic level was just over 25% fiscal year 2024 is our target to get above that level. We'll certainly share more next week in terms of specific initiatives. I think the way to think of it is we already had a lot of simplification efforts underway with Project Recode. Those can contribute about $300 million. That's one bucket. In addition to that, I articulated on the call even as it relates to actions we're taking and demonstrated at the end of 2021 and heading into 2022, we're increasing our initiatives, pricing, mix, portfolio optimization, and new initiatives on spend optimization as well. And then certainly, lastly, the Alaris ship hold that was an 80 basis point drag on the business going back to them. So while we're not being committed as it relates to timing, as you think through kind of the longer term timeframe, and that we will share next week, you would expect that to have a benefit over time. Thanks for the questions. Yes, thanks, Bob. I appreciate the question. Great question. So look I think going forward, we're going to continue to provide transparency as it relates to kind of the base performance of the business. I understand your question as it relates to kind of jump off points as it relates to quarter keep in mind, there were a lot of quarterly fluctuations as we navigated 2020 through COVID and 2021 with inflationary dynamics. I think it's simplest to kind of normalize and just look at things on a full-year basis. So as you think of our operating margins from 2021 of 21.7%, on the base business, there's really a few key drivers. One is we've talked about through this about having our utilization levels impacted due to pandemic, our strong growth profile through 2021 and 2022, we now anticipate being well above in driving almost 100 basis points of utilization upside 2021 to 2022 full-year to full-year. In addition to that last year, we had the impact of currency. There was a headwind on earnings, they got trapped in inventory, and as that bleeds through, we actually have about a 50 basis point improvement heading from 2021 to 2022, that goes through to operating margin. Lastly, where we're investing a lot of our time, of course is navigating the inflationary dynamics. And we talked about the net 50 basis point improvement in terms of outsized inflation, which we would anticipate being north of 200 basis points in full-year 2022 offsetting that will be a series of initiatives. There's not one thing it's actually a very well balanced plan. We have talked about on the call; we're continuing to drive cost improvement in our plans. We're taking enact actions on the procurement side of the business as well in terms of spend. We're looking at things from an SSG&A standpoint as well and leveraging that. And then, yes, there is going to be a strong focus on pricing portfolio mix, driving growth through higher GP areas. And the net of all of those we actually expect a 50 basis point improvement. Maybe lastly, just to give you some color on kind of where we are, because I think this is important. We've entered the year with specific action plans against those goals. So we have risk adjusted plans, very detailed targeted actions to deliver the improvement we need to mitigate against deflation. If you go a step further and look where we are from kind of an execution standpoint, 80% to 90% of those have been fully identified and the plans are moving, and some of them are just more timing dynamics in terms of when we may take price or when we'll evolve our portfolio. And of that number, almost half of that is actually already banked coming into year flowing through our inventory and P&L. Now that's quite a testament to the work that we did in the back half of 2021 and already have strong progress. So we look forward to sharing more as the year progresses, but we feel good about the plan and the progress that we'll achieve through the year. Hey, Robbie. How are you doing? It's Chris. Yes, as we said, the Form-10 will be later this year. That will -- we don't anticipate that being out by next week. Look, it's a good question. It's premature to share. We have to wait until the Form 10 is out, there will be much more detail there. But I really think the more important dynamic here is, right, this is actually just a portfolio transaction, and there is going to be sort of a reset of margin. And by definition, we had shared that, it is accretive, there will be a reset of margin, but more importantly, it's been diluted to both growth and margin growth, top-line growth and margin growth. So it could be an acceleration from that. And as we get into Investor Day, we can certainly share more as it relates to kind of the longer term impact as it relates to margin. And what I just shared in terms of our longer term margin improvement goals. We still feel really good about where we're going to position margin over time, and all these efforts going against that. And lastly, I think just the value creation opportunity this creates, I talked about the cash infusion of multiple years we get that gives us additional flexibility to think through how to reinvest and utilize those -- that cash infusion we can talk more about that as well over time. No, I think Tom shared the directional right. These were about $100 million in the current year 2021. And we've talked about essentially doubling that. So on an incremental basis, you can think of about another $100 million. So it's a contributor to growth of 30 to 40 bps gives us a lot of confidence in our growth profile, and then the capacity to do more of that over time. We'll certainly talk more about next year. In the context, it's more traditional R&D at this point, sorry. Yes, go ahead. Yes, thanks, Larry. Appreciate the question. Yes, I'll try to amplify some of the color that I provided earlier. So as we think of the year as the year progresses, first from the top-line, just to reiterate, we do actually expect relatively normalized growth with the exception of Q2 like I had shared because of the comparables. And then there's the dynamic of COVID only testing, which you'd expect to be more first half. So I would consider that that dynamic. From a margin standpoint, certainly first half, we anticipate to be lower. This is simply a matter of the inflationary dynamics that started in 2021, rolling through inventory. And the peak of when that rolls through and those costs actually hit is more like Q2. So kind of first half definitely less favorable margins versus the second half and Q2 in particular being kind of the high mark of that low, so to speak. And then obviously as the initiatives that we've already taken again, there's a lot of that banks, right, if you recall had shared about 50% of its already happening. But again, you get the dynamic of it flowing through inventory, so you end up with kind of the second half dynamic in the margin improvement throughout the back half. So the last item was just more of a discretionary tax item, I alluded to that could actually end up with some favorability in Q1, but those are very difficult to predict. So hopefully, that helps some. Yes. Thanks, Tom. So just some color, over the next three years, the Interventional segment expect to commercialize further 22 to 25 new products in China. And just an example of how we've been successful there in addition to what Tom said about doubling our business, but we recently just got approval or clearance for our Targeted Temperature Management technology in China. And we've actually just got our first two purchase orders this month from that, at margins that are creative to BDI, to BDX, and the sustained, and I would say prolific growth of our business in China. We expect to continue over the next period of time. Yes, no, Josh, I would just add that yes, it was an impact that was previously discussed. It was smaller relative to the main drivers that I framed as it relates to the progression from 2019 to 2021. And we always are doing continuous cost improvement initiatives that offset some of these things that happen. As Tom noted, China is well-positioned and we're thinking of that market more holistically. There is strong double-digit growth in 2021, actually at over 20%. And so when you think of it from a total portfolio standpoint, we feel real -- nicely positioned as it relates to both a growth profile, and then have nice actually margin enhancement as a result of that as we go-forward. So thanks Josh. Yes, thanks -- thanks Matt. Appreciate the question. Look, I think, it really starts with our focus on growth. I think a strong base growth profile that we guided on, coupled with if you look at the cash flow that we shared through 2021, that gives us a lot of flexibility on tuck-in M&A, right. So we have strong organic growth profile, the enhancement we're making to our R&D portfolio. And then that coupled with the tuck-in M&A capability that we will now be able to have on an ongoing basis. Tom earlier talked about the acceleration of deals that we've done recently, those alone can contribute about 40 basis points to growth. So one, I think, there is just a very strong growth profile there. Two, is just the disciplined focus on margin improvement. We knew that was something to focus on in addition to the cash management approach we've taken over time, that's enhanced growth. And so those are the two main drivers. As a matter of fact, we're actually cycling over a headwind on tax. That's been offset by some of the capital deployment we've been able to put at work with share repurchases. So you'll see us be more disciplined there with other value creating levers too due to the strong cash flow that we have. Okay. Thanks, Matt."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to BD's Third Fiscal Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 12, 2021 on the Investors' page of bd.com website, or by phone at 855-859-2056 for domestic calls and (404)537-3406 for international calls using the conformation number 9447085.  I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question and answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Kristen Stewart, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms. Stewart, you may begin.\nKristen Stewart: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via webcast at bd.com. This morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2021. You can find the press release along with the accompanying presentation on the Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com.  Leading this morning's call is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, as well as Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer. Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joining.  For Q&A by our 3 segment presidents. Alberto Mas, President of the Medical Segment, Simon Campion, President of interventional segments. and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and it is possible actual results could differ from our expectations.  Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent form 10-Q. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures regarding our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of purchase accounting, and other adjustments, can be found in our earnings release and its related financial schedules.  They are also in the appendix of the Investor Relations presentation slides available on the BD.com website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue present changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted.  When we refer to the base revenues, we're referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX, and Swabs. When we refer to base margins, we are adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested back into our business.  When we refer to any given peer group referring to the fiscal period, unless we note it as a calendar period. Finally, when we referred to NewCo during today's call we're referring to the planned spin out of our Diabetes Care business into an independently public traded Company following the effective trade date of the spin, which [Indiscernibl4e] announced on the second-quarter earnings call.  RemainCo refers to BD post-separation. As a reminder, this transaction is subject to market regulatory, and other conditions, including final approval by BD's Board of Directors and the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC. With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom. Tom?\nTom Polen: Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide highlights of the quarter and discuss the continued strong progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook.  After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will then open the call up for Q&A. But first, I want to comment on the other announcement we made this morning regarding Chris' intention to retire from BD, and join the Board of our Diabetes spin-off.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team, and the Company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent Director for NewCo's board. Now let's jump into our results.  We were very pleased with our third-quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all three segments. Revenues totaled $4.9 billion and our adjusted EPS was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations.  Total revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis, and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis. Results included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth. Excluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units.  The strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on the medical device utilization in the year-ago quarter. But Q3's result also reflects the continuing momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy.  Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 Fiscal '21, increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter Fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold. If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems\u2019 business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our pre-pandemic third-quarter fiscal 2019.  Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology/Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively over 2019 levels. Bioscience revenues were up 9%, surgery and peripheral intervention revenues were both up 8%. Elsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal '22 and beyond.  For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing. As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here. Also, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues were impacted by the Alaris ship-hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.  While I am pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, I'm equally pleased with the process we're making in improving our working capital and cash-flows. Cash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics.  Year-to-date cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior-year period. This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance a more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242.  This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017, and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012. Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4 times.  Overall, I'm really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business. This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption.  We now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis. This is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated.  We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%. Our positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory.  We now expect our full-year adjusted EPS range to be $12.85 to $12.95. Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call. Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my number one priority.  Last week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts. Working with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.2, following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version.  This new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020 recall notice, and provide programming, operational, and cybersecurity updates to affected devices. However, this software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.  To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA. As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY '22 outlook.  We believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance timelines. Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify, and empower. First, I'd like to focus on our growth pillar.  We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business, while purposefully investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead. I've spoken about these three innovations and growth focuses before, and we've been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%.  Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time. And this year, we've launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our business units, and across the globe.  And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses. It's been further enhanced by our acquisitions over the past 18 months.  And you'll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at our Investor Day on November 12. But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that we're advancing in the near term. In our Life Sciences business, I'm pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season.  Our BD Veritor combination test can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A, and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout. We see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, in advancing our strategy to enable better outcomes in non-acute settings.  Another innovation area I'd like to highlight is our Biosciences business. Biosciences has been a strong performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high-single-digit growth for the full year.  In June, we launched our new eCommerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry customers. Early feedback has been outstanding, and we're already seeing excellent traction and early adoption.  We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer. With the launch of our FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis. We've launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a cost-effective benchtop design. In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments, and next-generation dies (ph) that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multi-omics, and scientific support services.  Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop treatments for many related chronic diseases. You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences, and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President of BD Biosciences at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and Medtech Innovation Summit.  On Wednesday, August 11th. Next, let's turn to our inorganic innovations that we've added to our portfolio. As you know, we continue to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our core market leadership position and advance us into higher growth adjacencies.  Year-to-date, We've completed 7 tuck-in acquisitions, while at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions, these individual deals, were not meaningful from a revenue perspective. As we integrate these transactions into our portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.  Our 3 most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha Inc., and ZebraSci are good examples of our M&A strategy. Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business. Velano has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks.  This technology will help customers transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay. Velano's PIVO device will be integrated into our sales teams bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S. This is a great example of how we're expanding and strengthening our base business.  The second transaction is Tepha Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer technology. Over the past several years through our long-standing relationship, we've been commercializing this platform VR Phasix Resorbable Hernia mesh platform.  The acquisition benefits are two-fold. First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform. But more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction, and regeneration.  Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services Company. This acquisition provides the opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug-device combination products.  ZebraSci allows us to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies, and particularly smaller companies, where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into pre-filled combination devices. Next, I want to update you on our simplify initiatives, which are advancing well.  Through Project Recode we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network, and simplifying our business processes. Project Recode remains on track to achieve 300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY '24. We are also continuing the rollout of our BD Production System, which is a standardized BD approach to driving a next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants.  The BD Production System is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory days. We also continue to advance Inspire Quality, our quality, regulatory, and risk mitigation program. The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and capabilities that we're driving to empower our strategy. In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates survey with over 86% participation.  And what stood out was that our associates said we're making strong progress, with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018. And most notable were improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality, and excitement about the future of BD.  We're also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet. Our strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation.  Meaning, how we address unmet societal needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD. Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spinoff, which remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. We're making steady progress with our separation activities.  We recently announced that 2 directors from BD's board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes NewCo. Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a Director.  Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD board to the board of NewCo. Lieutenant General Melcher brings extensive experience in spinoffs, having served as the CEO of Exelixis, following its spinoff from ITT, and under his leadership, Exelixis spun off its Mission Systems business as a separate public Company.  Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in healthcare delivery, administration, medical research, and public health. I am confident their combined experience along with future planned board members will help to set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful, independent, publicly-traded Company focused on growth.  While continuing to evaluate additional board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires. Including Dev Kurdikar, who will be NewCo CEO, Jake AlgaWise (ph), who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann.  Jeff Mann joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development for NewCo. Jeff brings more than 2 decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law, and corporate governance. Most recently, he served as general counsel and secretary of Cantel Medical Group.  We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials. And we expect it to be publicly available around the end of the calendar year. Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts.  First, our base business momentum and our recovery from COVID continues. And it is broad-based. We expect that momentum to carry into fiscal '22 and beyond. As Chris will share with you, today's results underscore our confidence in strong mid-single-digit top-line growth for our base business next year.  Second, we are executing well against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D, as well as advancing our tuck-in M&A strategy. And third, I'm proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come.  We will deliver innovations for our customers, and power our associates, and create value for you, our shareholders. I've been with BD for 20 years, and I've never been more excited. We just completed our annual strategic review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago.  We look forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12th Investor Day. We hope you can join us. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, to review our financials and our outlook.\nChris Reidy: Thanks, Tom. I'm also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base business, which showed continued strong momentum. Third-quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased 26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis, and we're ahead of our expectations.  Our current quarter results also include 300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues compared to 98 million in the prior-year period. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods our base business revenues increased 17.6%. Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of last year.  The BD Medical segment revenues totaled 2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year. MDS revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and vascular care devices.  Additionally, worldwide revenues included 18 million from COVID vaccination devices. In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the expected declines in our Infusion Solutions.  As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and sets globally. Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales, and slightly better than expected market demand.  Pharm Systems continued to deliver strong growth with revenues up 12% driven by demand for our prefilled devices. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%. This included the 300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, 212 related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining 88 million from BD MAX collection, transport, and swabs.  Year-to-date COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over 1.6 billion. Despite lower average selling prices driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion for the fiscal year. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27% driven by strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.  IDS revenues increased 49%. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit performance across Specimen Management and Microbiology. Biosciences increased 27% driven by both research and clinical solutions.  We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments as lab activity is returning to normal levels. We also continue to see steady demand for research re-agents globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic research and biopharma companies.  BD Interventional sales totaled nearly 1.1 billion and were up nearly 35% reflecting the COVID anniversary impact on elective procedures. Surgery revenues increased 68% and peripheral intervention increased 32%. Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter.  We saw sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention. However, in the last several weeks, we are seeing some impact from the COVID Delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states. Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our PureWick and targeted temperature management franchises.  Now, turning to our P&L, as we expected and as communicated, our gross margins this year are being negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances, and FX headwinds, which are more acute in the second half of the year. Also as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially.  Our gross margin was 51.5%. However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from an inventory provision related to COVID testing. Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%.  On a sequential basis, our base business gross margin declined from our second-quarter rate of 53.7% due to 3 factors. 70 basis points of incremental FX headwinds, 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material costs and inbound freight, as these costs rolled through our inventory, and 20 basis points of other expenses, including Alaris quality remediation.  Now, turning to SSG&A. Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to 1.2 billion or 25.2% of revenues. As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, we are continuing to see higher shipping costs.  This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment initiatives. As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY '21 will not re-occur. Our R&D spending totaled 321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis.  The higher R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD innovation and growth fund. Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.  On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth of 22%. Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%. The inventory provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier, negatively impacted operating margins by approximately a 150 basis points. Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at 98 million.  The adjusted tax rate was 5.8%, lower than we previously expected, due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. The lower tax rate essentially offsets the impact from COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $291.9 million.  We repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of 1 billion at an average price of approximately $242. Our adjusted EPS increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis, and were up 25.9% on a currency-neutral basis. Now, I would like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year.  Our guidance continues to assume no major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic. However, we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID Delta variant in the last one to two weeks in certain U.S. states, and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance.  That said, given the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14% up from our previous range of 10% to 12%. Our revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to 8% Further, we have reaffirmed our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion.  We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency. This brings our total reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%. For the full year, we now expect our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95. This higher guidance reflects the positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate.  These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices. Next, I wanna share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full-year fiscal '21 and provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits on our margins.  We expect our full-year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%. And this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. We expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%.  This range includes a 200 basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments. Finally, I'd like to address FY '22. We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November earnings call. But we wanted to provide some directional color today.  To give you a sense as to what a floor could look like in fiscal '22, we have taken the following approach. As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing. Therefore, we have not modeled any testing revenue beyond the typical flu season.  With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '22 over our fiscal '21 base revenues, which as a reminder, adjust for COVID diagnostic testing revenues. With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions.  As we have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with [Indiscernible] timelines. However, as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately grant clearance. It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing. We are not assuming Alaris 510(k) clearance.  It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY '21. We believe it is prudent and responsible not to definitively predict FDA clearance timelines.  That said, we remain confident in our submission, and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k) clearance. We expect to drive base business gross, and operating margin expansion.  We expect the operating margin for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and translate into double-digit operating income growth. For reference, we expect our base business operating margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021.  With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted EPS floor of at least $12. This represents approximately low-teens growth over our expected base business earnings in fiscal 2021. Now before opening it up to Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on today's announcement of my upcoming retirement.  With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flows, which is evident by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've been doing and the restart of our sharp share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the right time for the transition as the Company is well-positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and impact the lives of patients around the world. I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new CFO.  And I'm very excited about the value creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to ensure the success as a member of their board. With that, let me turn it back to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thank you. Chris and Kristen, I think it's now we should open up the Operator -- open up the line to Q&A.\nOperator: Great. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Great, thank you and good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nTom Polen: We can, Bob. Good morning.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Great. Good morning. And Chris, congratulations on your decision.\nChris Reidy: Thank you very much.\nBob Hopkins: Yeah. Absolutely. So I guess the first question I would have, and thank you for all the detail today in the early thoughts on 2022. It looks like you're suggesting operating margins in 20 -- next year will -- might be in the 22% to 23% kind of range. That's still multiple hundreds of basis points below where you were in fiscal '19. So can you just help us understand the difference between 2019, and this new guidance for 2022 and why you're those couple hundred basis points below that level?\nChris Reidy: Sure.\nTom Polen: I'll let that Chris respond.\nChris Reidy: Sure, Bob. Thank you for your comments too. Yeah. We -- as we think about margins, we do see the opportunity to get back to those 2019 margins over time, and we'll see that as Alaris comes back into the market, and as recode and our normal continuous improvement occur, and we'll see that improvement also as we grow mid-single-digits and we provide leverage that drops to the bottom line and that will also increase. There's a number of things that have pushed those margins down. We've talked about those in the past. You have Alaris, the ship hold. Obviously, there's an impact, but that will come back. We also have the drop in the China volume-based procurement is an impact, and obviously we're seeing some pressure from inflation, et cetera, that have run through. So, they have come down, but the model is intact, and we're very confident that we can drive those margins back to the '19 levels in the next -- in the near term as Alaris comes back and as we get the continuous improvement from Recode.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Just to make sure I'm hearing it. So, the primary difference between those 2 is you guys see it as, really, those 3 things: Alaris, the China price cut, and then inflation? Just want to make sure we have a sense for all the moving pieces. Okay. That's it. Okay, and then in terms of the time line to get back to those levels, is that something that's a multiyear process or do you think that that can happen within a year or two? And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\nChris Reidy: Yes. So, a couple of things will help us improve. And the other thing that I should mention is there is some FX drag on margins as well, and that's been flowing through. But as we think about improvements going forward, we'll see improvements from utilization as utilization comes back. And so that will help -- will also comparatively to the margins that we have this year. We\u2019ll see continuous improvement, Recode kicking in. We'll see less one-time items. We took in a number of one-time items this year, the spending in the Veritor proceeds, et cetera, so those come back.  So you would expect to see us getting back to those kind of margins as Alaris kicks in, in '23, and we see that impact and as we make continuous improvement in '22 and '23.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, all the best to you.\nChris Reidy: Thank you, sir.\nVijay Kumar: I hope you enjoy a good rest. \u2013Tom, maybe starting with the margins back on Bob's question. It's -- one way of looking at it is your pre-pandemic gross margins were 56%. I think your base for the fiscal '21 is 53.5 to 54. Walk through the delta about 70 bps is -- seems to be inflationary costs, 70 bps. FX, you do have these inventory charges related to COVID diagnostics and Alaris for moving parts. I guess my question is, when do inflationory costs abate? Do we have to annaulize? Is that a mid of next year? Should FX still be a drag next year, and when you think about COVID inventory charges, are we done with that in Q4 or is that going to be a drag in fiscal '22?\nTom Polen: Hey, Vijay, let me -- I'll take a little bit of that question and, again, let Chris comment further on the margin details. When it comes to just the inflationary question that you had, certainly I think we felt the most significant impact of inflation already, and we have a good view of where that's going to be in '22 as we've rolled up our costs. As you know, it's been an unprecedented period of time there as you look at everything from the cost of resins to electronic components and shipping. And shipping is up 4x to move products, let's say from Asia or Europe to the U.S. or vice versa. We are also being very proactive in -- we're not looking to absorb all of those increases in raw material costs over time. We are beginning to pass on some of those. We've raised our shipping rates for customers, and we are passing on price increases. Of course, as you know, we do have long-term contracts and tenders around the world, and so that's not something that we can pass through with those price increases immediately, but we do have a very active program to share those increases. We have to share those increases with customers that will not happen overnight. I\u2019d just share that will also be something that will have an impact as we look forward. We're not going to absorb all of those raw material costs just within BD. Chris, other comments on margin?\nChris Reidy: Sure. Yeah, I think it would be helpful to look at the flow from third quarter to the fourth quarter. We do expect margins to improve. I think we said that our margins would be 53 to 53.5. That's up a full point from the Q3 margins, and that's coming from improved utilization combined with some of our continuous improvement efforts. We'll also have less one-time airfreight that we saw in the back half of '21, and we will have some pricing actions as well. We do expect it to improve operating margins more than the normal 50 basis points relative to that '21 to '22, and that again comes from utilization. As that improves next year, there's less impact from FX. We have seen FX flowing through our inventory, and so you'll see that abate going forward. And then, we see our continuous improvement items offsetting any continued flow-through of inflationary pricing. When we look at the impact on our raw materials, resins as you know, is a big piece of that. Resins is a combination of some inflationary pressure, but it's also a function of other things; supply and demand in the oil market. And we took a big hit on that in '21, and we would expect that to abate somewhat, and that's something that we're watching very closely as we think about giving guidance in '22.\nVijay Kumar: Got you. And maybe Tom, [Indiscernible] more on the Q4 revenue guidance and some of the comments you made on reinvestments. The Q4, it looks like 3Q, your base grew 4% for pre-pandemic 3Q, 19 levels. Q4, I'm not sure if I'm doing the Math correct, but I'm getting to a 2% slight B-cell versus 3Q. Is that just conservatism, and related to that -- the reinvestments that we are making should we expect any new products looks through in fiscal '22? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yes. It was a little bit difficult to hear what you said there, Vijay on the Q4 topic, I'll let Chris comment on that. But as we've said in the past, we do expect that -- and we'll share a lot more about this on our Investor Day in November, which obviously we hope to see you there -- is we expect the impact of our investments of the COVID profit reinvestments to begin having an impact in the back half of next -- towards the tail end of next year. And we'll talk about what those specific programs are. Some are for short-term R&D lifecycle management programs that we'll be hitting, but also include non-R&D initiatives such as reinvestments we made to establish new, for example, telesales organization in Europe that's helping us access smaller hospitals that we weren't calling in before and we're getting new growth from, or expanding our non-acute sales channel in the U.S. We used some of those investments to accelerate investments there, tapping into a high growth market as the non-acute space is now growing much faster than the Acute Care market where we've had our traditional sales strength in. And so obviously, those commercial investments have near-term payoff. We expect actually the investments that we're making on the commercial side this year, to be fully-funding, self-funding next year. So they're quick paybacks and we'll see those benefits as we've said, that strong mid-single-digits profile in our base business next year. On the other question, let me turn that over to Chris.\nChris Reidy: Yeah. Vijay, I would just remind you that, going back in history, if you look at the Q4 of FY '19, that's a tough compare. That was the biggest MMS quarter for a number of reasons. And so that's what you're seeing as you're doing your calculation.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nTom Polen: Hey Robbie. Good morning?\nRobbie Marcus: Good morning. And I'll hand my congratulations, Chris we'll be sorry to see you go.\nChris Reidy: Thanks Robbie, appreciate it.\nRobbie Marcus: I don't wanna be the dead horse here, but I wanted to focus on the fourth quarter margin guide, and the floor of $12 for next year. It's been, probably, if I go back, a decade-plus since we last had operating margins as low as you're guiding for fourth quarter. And even to get to a floor of $12, versus where you are in that fourth-quarter margin, is pretty tough to do. So I was hoping you could really, as best as you can, walk through the building blocks of why the fourth quarter margin is so low, especially after you said last quarter it'd be in the low twenties for the back half of this year, it looks more like high teens. And then some of the building blocks you used to get to a floor of $12 and on top of that, how you're thinking about what a floor means in relation to where numbers might settle out?\nTom Polen: Hey Robbie. This is Tom. So on the -- let me take the -- I'll let Chris address the Q4 question that you had. On the $12 floor, I think Chris walked through very clearly how we built up the $12 floor there. And essentially that takes out all COVID -- standalone COVID diagnostics. So all of that comes out. Any standalone COVID testing that we were to have would be incremental to the $12 and you know how much that is this year. Again, it's very difficult to predict what type of COVID testing is going to occur next year, and so we thought it's most prudent to focus on projecting our base business. We do have some Veritor flu sales and flu - COVID combination, which is really a next generation flu test. Built-in but much more aligned to what you would see in a normal flu season, rather than increased demand from testing for COVID patients. As I said, we have no COVID standalone revenue. And so that's how we've built in our $12 floor. As Chris also mentioned, we don't have Alaris 510(k) assumed at all. We do believe that just given inherent inability to predict FDA approval timing, it's not prudent to try to peg when that would be. And so we do not have anything beyond Alaris revenues being flat year-on-year, which as a reminder, we said was a little over a $100 million in FY '21. And so we have that flat going into '22. So that's that. Those are the main factors, Chris went through a number of others. We can circle back on any other questions you have there, but let's go back on your Q4 question. I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Reidy: Sure. Thanks. Tom. And what I would remind you, Robbie, is that we have pointed to the fact that we are making investments this year and not to really look at the second half margins. We said they were going to be lower. You said not to use those as indicative base to jump off for '22, which is what we're saying today. The Q4 margins are pressured by an additional amount of COVID reinvestment. So we made that reinvestment announcement earlier. It takes a while. It tends to be back-end loaded, so there's a preponderance of reinvestment there in the quarter. We continue to see some drag from FX in the quarter, although less than the third quarter. We also expect to see the impact of inflationary costs running through our inventory. And we see that coming through in the fourth quarter as well. So when you sum all that up, we talked about the baseline of 21.5 to 22 as the jumping-off point. We said that it was more than our 50 basis point target going forward. And that -- how much more is where you have to plug it in to get to the $12 number that we gave as a floor. And I think Tom articulated what that $12 floor was meant to be. It doesn't have any testing assumption for COVID in it, although we would assume some water level of standalone testing. It also assumes the testing for flu and COVID combination, which is equal to a normal flu season. It's still pretty early to call that and that's something that we'll give more clarity on as we get into November. It is, just that, a baseline. We wanted to make sure people understood that we can grow more than normal off of '21. And get to at least that $12 level and to close out anything lower than that. And then we'll build from there as we give more specific guidance in November.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe just 1 quick follow-up. The tax rate came in a little lower this year. What do you think we should be thinking as we head into next year?\nChris Reidy: I think you flow that through for this year. And then for next year, we should be -- we've traditionally guided 14% to 16%. I think you should consider that being at the low end of that range.\nKristen Stewart: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Chris, congratulations on your decision.\nChris Reidy: Thanks Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Just a couple of questions on the margin. When we look at the 20 to 20.5 base for Q4, what's the ramp through fiscal 2022 look like? On the last call, you said it would ramp through the year. And Chris just a multi-part question on the margin. So I apologize in advance. You had guidance to '25 to '26 post-Alaris, post-China VBP, so is the difference here mostly inflation? You talked about the moving parts and the $200 million reinvestment. That alone, you said would come off -- that's a 100 basis points. So just lastly here or any other headwinds, tailwinds to consider on that he margin commentary.\nChris Reidy: Okay. There were multiple parts of that, I'm not sure I got them all. So let's start with -- I would say from the phasing, let's talk about the phasing. I think, it's still too early to tell. We can't give that kind of specificity for November. I would say, one of the things that I did mention was utilization. I do think that builds throughout the year, but that's as much clarity as I would give to that. What's the second part of the question?\nLarry Biegelsen: Well, just on the -- people have looked at this closely. Post Alaris, recall the China VBP. You gave guidance of 25% to 26% for the operating margin. Is the difference really here mostly inflation? And just lastly, the $200 million reinvestment in 2021, that goes away next year. That alone is a 100 basis points.\nChris Reidy: That does come back from that baseline and that's in the assumptions that get us to more than the normal 50 basis points. So that does go away and it does come back in margins. The difference between the -- weather it's the 56ish on gross margin or 25 to 26 on operating margin, is not really inflation it's more around the China VOBP, Alaris and some FX impacts that on the combination of those bring you down in the area of about a 150 basis points on a gross margin basis for example. If you take a step back, we're pulling all the levers that are necessary to drive that up. So the base business is doing well. That's a great foundation. We're reinvesting the Veritor proceeds that drive revenue growth going forward, but also to drive Recode and help there. We've got a balanced allocation strategy. You saw us buying back shares. That will help on the bottom line, we're divesting non-strategic businesses that will help with the growth profile going forward. So all of those things give us great confidence that we'll get back to those kind of margins in the near future as we take those steps. And we're headed in the right direction and the fundamental assumption of mid-single-digit growth on the top. And double-digit TSR in the bottom implies a certain amount of leverage that we feel very comfortable with. We feel good with that operating model, it's intact and that will drive margins up over time.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks [Indiscernible] I'll drop given the multi-part question there. Thanks for taking the question.\nTom Polen: Sure. Larry any time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nTom Polen: Hi, Richard.\nRichard Newitte: Hi. Thanks a lot. And that last one was really the question I was looking to ask, but just -- if you could just go through those parts a little bit more thoroughly. You've got China VOBP, you have inflation, you have Alaris. And then FX as the bad guys, but then you have reinvestment growing away as the good guy. Could you just add those up again for us 1 more time? Just to make sure I'm clear on what the pluses and minuses are. I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Reidy: Okay. I think you did a good job of it. That is the summary. You have exactly those parts and that is the headwind. The Alaris headwind is something that should come back to us in 2023 overtime. And I think you've got the parts.\nRichard Newitte: Okay. And then going back to I think it was Robbie's question, maybe just putting a little bit more of a framework about how to think about what a floor truly means and any kind of broad strokes, how to thinking about what testing could look like based on everything that you know today.\nChris Reidy: Yeah.\nRichard Newitte: And what a reasonable base case might look like based on what, you know today?\nChris Reidy: I would refer you back to the prepared remarks because I think we were very clear as to what's included in that $12, and what is not included. The ability to estimate what testing is going to be next year is very volatile. Frankly, if you asked me two weeks ago, it would have been a different answer than it is today with the Delta variant, and it'll be very different in November. So when we give November guidance, we'll give you a better sense of that, but the floor is exactly what it is. It's no testing other than a normal flu season and nothing in for Alaris. And that's all I'll say about that.\nRichard Newitte: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck, Chris. Congratulations\nChris Reidy: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Barclays.\nTravis Steed: Congrats Chris again, from\nChris Reidy: [Indiscernible]\nTravis Steed: On the calculus for the mid-single-digit revenue growth and the double-digit shareholder return. When you think about that, is there a minimum operating margin that you're committed to longer-term, with that calculus?\nChris Reidy: I think it's really an improvement in the margin year-in, year-out, and that's been the model. And we're very confident that we can return to that and to drive those margins back up to the '19 levels and beyond as we move forward.\nTravis Steed: Okay. And then do you expect Alaris to be accretive right away to operating margin or is there going to be a period where it takes a bit longer to get accretive? And then, on the COVID testing margins, you mentioned a lower price point, OUS. Is there a big difference in margins on COVID testing U.S. and OUS?\nTom Polen: I'll just take that. On the ex-U.S., then 1 of the main differences is, as we had shared in the past, we did launch a manual test. Ex-U.S. particularly in Europe. We don't sell that in the U.S. and that is at a lower price competitive with manual -- manually read lateral flow test. So that's one, there's a product mix difference. And there is a slightly lower price, even on the base Veritor in some cases, given the way that those products are purchased in very large quantities on government -- country-based tenders. Therefore it gets a little bit better pricing, given the scale of the purchasing. So that's the main thing there on Veritor as we think about the mix. Again, we're really pleased that we're right in the revenue range that we project. We're actually ahead of what we projected at the beginning of the year and then have continued to be in that 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion outlook for the full year there. On your other question, Travis was uh?\nTravis Steed: On the operating margin difference.\nTom Polen: The operating margin.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Yeah\nTom Polen: Chris, on that one.\nChris Reidy: The operating margin from -- when it comes back, okay. Yes\nTom Polen: Yes.\nChris Reidy: The only thing I would say is you're -- you should be thinking about when Alaris comes back that the -- it takes a while for the sales to ramp. And that's all I would say on that.\nTom Polen: And we have said before, Travis, as well, we do have -- we very purposely kept a number of expenses on the P&L that stay at the GP line, that as Alaris does, is 510(k) approved. Those expenses will now get absorbed by the higher revenue as soon as the higher revenue starts to come through. Those expenses at stay on the GP line, for example, are very large service organization that we know we need. It's extremely experienced strong team, deep relationships with our customers. And we've kept that those expenses in place because we want that team in place to continue to service our customers, as we ultimately get the 510(k) approved, and back fully to market. Same thing on our commercial side, right? We've kept our -- while the revenue has gone down we've kept that commercial team in place. We have many, many people with decade-plus experience and long relationships with our customers who have great expertise in that -- not only that space, but overall medication management. And so we want to keep that expertise in place as we think about it long term. So those expenses, of course, as revenue ramps, we don't see the need to add those service or sales investments because we've actually kept them in place. Similar to what we had when it was at much higher revenue number.\nTravis Steed: All right. Great. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan: Thank you for taking my questions and good morning.\nTom Polen: Morning.\nMatthew Mishan: Not just throw another moving piece at you, but I'm assuming that the floor doesn't include the diabetes spend. Do you have a better sense of what dilution is from that and impact to our operating margin on a pro forma basis?\nChris Reidy: I'll take that. The floor does not contemplate that. As we complete the spin and as we get closer to the spin, we will make adjustments to any kind of outlook or guidance that we have. The $12 relates to BDX as a whole. And as it relates to dilution, what we have said is that the dilution to RemainCo would be primarily stranded costs. We'll have transition service agreements in place, and we'll have some time to offset any potential dilution that we have during that transition services period of time. And more to come on that as we get closer to the spin date.\nMatthew Mishan: Okay. And then -- excellent. And then, let's a little bit talk about the guidance for next year. I think everyone assume s there will be some COVID testing, so there will be upside from that, but the flu season, is also probably a little bit lower than what's normal. What is the normal flu season for you as far as revenue goes so we can adjust that Delta?\nChris Reidy: And then the first thing I would do is just correct your statement that we didn't give guidance for '22. Using the term guidance is inaccurate. We just gave you a floor and a way to think about it. I just want to make sure that that's clear. And what we said was a normal flu season. And we have talked about in the past that, that normal flu season is in the range of $80 to $100 million and it remains unclear as to what type of flu season, flu/ COVID season we have. Last year, the flu season was basically nonexistent. That's why we outlined that assumption as clearly as we did.\nMatthew Mishan: Okay. My apologies. And it seems like that COVID testing, the upside would be greater than downside from flu at that point. Is that correct?\nChris Reidy: I'm not sure what you just said there, but I think the -- would there be some COVID testing standalone that's something we'll give insights going forward in November.\nTom Polen: Just a reminder, Matthew, we do have a COVID flu combination test, rapid test. Which we will can step -- that's in that flu category as well. So we do think even if there's a lighter flu season, the availability of symptoms; we will be testing for combination as well. We do expect there will be some continued testing of COVID only as well. But the ability to predict that number right now, again, we're not giving guidance. We just shared a floor number. If there is to predict how much standalone COVID testing is going to happen next year, it is not something one should do. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nChris Reidy: Good morning, Matt.\nMatt Taylor: All right, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats, Chris, you'll be missed.\nChris Reidy: Thanks.\nMatt Taylor: I think we've got margins [Indiscernible], so I'm going to ask a couple of growth questions. The first one is I wanted to ask you about your assumptions for disruption. I know there are some states that are seeing that [Indiscernible] procedures now. Would you characterize the build into your guidance as relatively minor? Any framing that you can do for us in terms of how much disruption you think we could see here in the coming month?\nTom Polen: Yeah. This is Tom. Appreciate the question there. I can give a little bit of color on what we're seeing overall, both in just general utilization, and then I'll talk about what we're seeing more recently in just the last 1 or 2 weeks. As I think most folks are aware, we have one of our informatics platforms is called MedMined which is a software that allows us to see real-time admission data, utilization data, test data, outbreak data, resistance data, literally real-time. It's hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And so some of the details that we see generally are over Q3. We saw about 91% to 92% utilization versus pre-COVID, about 92% exit in June. And that was a sequential improvement from Q2 average, which was in the 80's. And we expect to see further sequential improvement as we think about Q4 overall. In the non-acute sector it was already -- we saw a 105% utilization versus pre-COVID in May June, and sequential improvements from Q2, which was in the 95% range. As we think about the impact of -- and Europe by the way, with the data we look at show the bed utilization first pre-COVID utilization overall versus pre-COVID was estimated around 92%. Exited the quarter around 93%, which was sequentially up from Q2, which was about 86%. So as we think about the impact of COVID Delta variant in the last 1 or 2 weeks, we've seen it really, as was expected I think, when there would be outbreaks, that you'd start seeing them in concentrated geographic pockets. And that's certainly what you're seeing with the Delta variant. The last number I had was 16 meaningful U.S. healthcare systems that had stopped or significantly reduced elective procedures. And many of those, or the largest ones of those U.S. systems that have done that, that was as of last week, that was the number I had was 16. They were down in Florida, Louisiana, a [indiscernible] number of those were in the south. So it's -- we're seeing it in those areas, but not, certainly not across the country broadly. And we're not seeing really any significant change globally. Certainly there's pockets where that's happening, but for example in Europe, which is a major market for us we're not seeing a change there. We have built in some continuation of that into our guidance. And so if it doesn't continue at that level, that could be an opportunity. But again, being prudent as I think we've been all year long, we took an approach that said, well, if the Delta were to continue and there were to be some impact on procedural volumes, we would be absorbing that within our guidance. It would have to be a significant change versus what's being seen.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks for that. I just had one quick follow-up. You did a bunch of tuck-ins. I was wondering if you could quantify the contribution we could expect from those, as you purchased that we're going forward.\nTom Polen: We see that as built into our outlook map. And when we talk about the strong mid-single-digit performance next year, and continuing to help fuel our mid-single-digit growth profile. None of those acquisitions have any meaningful impact in Q3. Many of them closed, actually, either at the very end of Q3 or even more recently in Q4. So not an impact in Q3, and part of our growth equation, as we look going forward. But as you said, we're excited about the tuck-ins we're doing. It's combination of both strengthening our base business like what you see in Velano, offering really unique innovation and into an already extremely strong portfolio and a bag that we have. 2 areas that are entering us into new spaces. Like what you saw with Tepha or the ZebraSci, which both enters us into new spaces, but connect us deeply with an important customer segments, small biopharma, providing them services. That -- ZebraSci is the leader in providing them combination drug-device testing services allows us to build those relationships further. And as you know, many of the new drugs coming into the pipelines are in that small biotech segment that we think is attractive to invest behind. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: At this time we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Thank you, Operator. Before we sign off and on behalf of the board and the entire executive team, I want to thank BD's 70,000 associates around the globe. This past quarter, I had a special opportunity to travel to a number of our sites, including our warehouse in Georgia, 2 of our plants in Nebraska, who've all been working tirelessly to produce essential medical devices.  Some that are being used for the pandemic response. And I'd like to say a special thanks to them and all of our manufacturing associates around the globe. They are the essential part of our frontline team and make me proud to be BD. And so I thank you, directly, on behalf of the entire organization. For all of you listening, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And thank you for joining in. Hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide highlights of the quarter and discuss the continued strong progress we have made on our BD 2025 strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook.  After our prepared remarks, Chris and I will then open the call up for Q&A. But first, I want to comment on the other announcement we made this morning regarding Chris' intention to retire from BD, and join the Board of our Diabetes spin-off.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, the leadership team, and the Company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service to BD. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will make him an excellent Director for NewCo's board. Now let's jump into our results.  We were very pleased with our third-quarter performance, powered by strong growth and momentum in our base business across all three segments. Revenues totaled $4.9 billion and our adjusted EPS was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations.  Total revenues were up 26.9% on a reported basis, and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis. Results included COVID diagnostic testing revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth. Excluding COVID testing revenues, our base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units.  The strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective procedures and its impact on the medical device utilization in the year-ago quarter. But Q3's result also reflects the continuing momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025 strategy.  Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 Fiscal '21, increased 3.9% relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter Fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the impact of the Alaris ship hold. If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems' business, our total revenues would have increased 6.6% relative to our pre-pandemic third-quarter fiscal 2019.  Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology/Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers, where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively over 2019 levels. Bioscience revenues were up 9%, surgery and peripheral intervention revenues were both up 8%. Elsewhere, we see opportunities for improvement ahead in fiscal '22 and beyond.  For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2% versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-based purchasing. As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here. Also, as I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues were impacted by the Alaris ship-hold, and we expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.  While I am pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, I'm equally pleased with the process we're making in improving our working capital and cash-flows. Cash flow performance has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics.  Year-to-date cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior-year period. This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance a more balanced capital allocation strategy this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately $242.  This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017, and the largest amount we have repurchased since 2012. Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2 billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4 times.  Overall, I'm really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive momentum in our base business. This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption.  We now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis. This is higher than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing revenues of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated.  We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%. Our positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 while continuing to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess and obsolete COVID testing inventory.  We now expect our full-year adjusted EPS range to be $12.85 to $12.95. Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call. Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my number one priority.  Last week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts. Working with the FDA, we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to version 12.1.2, following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version.  This new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020 recall notice, and provide programming, operational, and cybersecurity updates to affected devices. However, this software update has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.  To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA. As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY '22 outlook.  We believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance timelines. Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify, and empower. First, I'd like to focus on our growth pillar.  We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable core business, while purposefully investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead. I've spoken about these three innovations and growth focuses before, and we've been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%.  Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time. And this year, we've launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our business units, and across the globe.  And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses. It's been further enhanced by our acquisitions over the past 18 months.  And you'll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at our Investor Day on November 12. But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that we're advancing in the near term. In our Life Sciences business, I'm pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season.  Our BD Veritor combination test can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A, and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout. We see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, in advancing our strategy to enable better outcomes in non-acute settings.  Another innovation area I'd like to highlight is our Biosciences business. Biosciences has been a strong performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high-single-digit growth for the full year.  In June, we launched our new eCommerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry customers. Early feedback has been outstanding, and we're already seeing excellent traction and early adoption.  We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer. With the launch of our FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis. We've launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a cost-effective benchtop design. In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments, and next-generation dies (ph) that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multi-omics, and scientific support services.  Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop treatments for many related chronic diseases. You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences, and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President of BD Biosciences at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and Medtech Innovation Summit.  On Wednesday, August 11th. Next, let's turn to our inorganic innovations that we've added to our portfolio. As you know, we continue to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our core market leadership position and advance us into higher growth adjacencies.  Year-to-date, We've completed 7 tuck-in acquisitions, while at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions, these individual deals, were not meaningful from a revenue perspective. As we integrate these transactions into our portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.  Our 3 most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha Inc., and ZebraSci are good examples of our M&A strategy. Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business. Velano has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks.  This technology will help customers transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay. Velano's PIVO device will be integrated into our sales teams bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S. This is a great example of how we're expanding and strengthening our base business.  The second transaction is Tepha Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer technology. Over the past several years through our long-standing relationship, we've been commercializing this platform VR Phasix Resorbable Hernia mesh platform.  The acquisition benefits are two-fold. First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform. But more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction, and regeneration.  Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services Company. This acquisition provides the opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug-device combination products.  ZebraSci allows us to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies, and particularly smaller companies, where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into pre-filled combination devices. Next, I want to update you on our simplify initiatives, which are advancing well.  Through Project Recode we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network, and simplifying our business processes. Project Recode remains on track to achieve 300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY '24. We are also continuing the rollout of our BD Production System, which is a standardized BD approach to driving a next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants.  The BD Production System is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory days. We also continue to advance Inspire Quality, our quality, regulatory, and risk mitigation program. The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and capabilities that we're driving to empower our strategy. In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates survey with over 86% participation.  And what stood out was that our associates said we're making strong progress, with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018. And most notable were improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality, and excitement about the future of BD.  We're also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet. Our strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation.  Meaning, how we address unmet societal needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD. Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spinoff, which remains on track for the first half of calendar 2022. We're making steady progress with our separation activities.  We recently announced that 2 directors from BD's board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes NewCo. Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a Director.  Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD board to the board of NewCo. Lieutenant General Melcher brings extensive experience in spinoffs, having served as the CEO of Exelixis, following its spinoff from ITT, and under his leadership, Exelixis spun off its Mission Systems business as a separate public Company.  Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in healthcare delivery, administration, medical research, and public health. I am confident their combined experience along with future planned board members will help to set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful, independent, publicly-traded Company focused on growth.  While continuing to evaluate additional board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires. Including Dev Kurdikar, who will be NewCo CEO, Jake AlgaWise (ph), who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann.  Jeff Mann joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development for NewCo. Jeff brings more than 2 decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law, and corporate governance. Most recently, he served as general counsel and secretary of Cantel Medical Group.  We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials. And we expect it to be publicly available around the end of the calendar year. Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts.  First, our base business momentum and our recovery from COVID continues. And it is broad-based. We expect that momentum to carry into fiscal '22 and beyond. As Chris will share with you, today's results underscore our confidence in strong mid-single-digit top-line growth for our base business next year.  Second, we are executing well against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D, as well as advancing our tuck-in M&A strategy. And third, I'm proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come.  We will deliver innovations for our customers, and power our associates, and create value for you, our shareholders. I've been with BD for 20 years, and I've never been more excited. We just completed our annual strategic review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago.  We look forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12th Investor Day. We hope you can join us. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, to review our financials and our outlook. Thank you. Chris and Kristen, I think it's now we should open up the Operator -- open up the line to Q&A. We can, Bob. Good morning. I'll let that Chris respond. Good morning, Vijay. Hey, Vijay, let me -- I'll take a little bit of that question and, again, let Chris comment further on the margin details. When it comes to just the inflationary question that you had, certainly I think we felt the most significant impact of inflation already, and we have a good view of where that's going to be in '22 as we've rolled up our costs. As you know, it's been an unprecedented period of time there as you look at everything from the cost of resins to electronic components and shipping. And shipping is up 4x to move products, let's say from Asia or Europe to the U.S. or vice versa. We are also being very proactive in -- we're not looking to absorb all of those increases in raw material costs over time. We are beginning to pass on some of those. We've raised our shipping rates for customers, and we are passing on price increases. Of course, as you know, we do have long-term contracts and tenders around the world, and so that's not something that we can pass through with those price increases immediately, but we do have a very active program to share those increases. We have to share those increases with customers that will not happen overnight. I'd just share that will also be something that will have an impact as we look forward. We're not going to absorb all of those raw material costs just within BD. Chris, other comments on margin? Yes. It was a little bit difficult to hear what you said there, Vijay on the Q4 topic, I'll let Chris comment on that. But as we've said in the past, we do expect that -- and we'll share a lot more about this on our Investor Day in November, which obviously we hope to see you there -- is we expect the impact of our investments of the COVID profit reinvestments to begin having an impact in the back half of next -- towards the tail end of next year. And we'll talk about what those specific programs are. Some are for short-term R&D lifecycle management programs that we'll be hitting, but also include non-R&D initiatives such as reinvestments we made to establish new, for example, telesales organization in Europe that's helping us access smaller hospitals that we weren't calling in before and we're getting new growth from, or expanding our non-acute sales channel in the U.S. We used some of those investments to accelerate investments there, tapping into a high growth market as the non-acute space is now growing much faster than the Acute Care market where we've had our traditional sales strength in. And so obviously, those commercial investments have near-term payoff. We expect actually the investments that we're making on the commercial side this year, to be fully-funding, self-funding next year. So they're quick paybacks and we'll see those benefits as we've said, that strong mid-single-digits profile in our base business next year. On the other question, let me turn that over to Chris. Hey Robbie. Good morning? Hey Robbie. This is Tom. So on the -- let me take the -- I'll let Chris address the Q4 question that you had. On the $12 floor, I think Chris walked through very clearly how we built up the $12 floor there. And essentially that takes out all COVID -- standalone COVID diagnostics. So all of that comes out. Any standalone COVID testing that we were to have would be incremental to the $12 and you know how much that is this year. Again, it's very difficult to predict what type of COVID testing is going to occur next year, and so we thought it's most prudent to focus on projecting our base business. We do have some Veritor flu sales and flu - COVID combination, which is really a next generation flu test. Built-in but much more aligned to what you would see in a normal flu season, rather than increased demand from testing for COVID patients. As I said, we have no COVID standalone revenue. And so that's how we've built in our $12 floor. As Chris also mentioned, we don't have Alaris 510(k) assumed at all. We do believe that just given inherent inability to predict FDA approval timing, it's not prudent to try to peg when that would be. And so we do not have anything beyond Alaris revenues being flat year-on-year, which as a reminder, we said was a little over a $100 million in FY '21. And so we have that flat going into '22. So that's that. Those are the main factors, Chris went through a number of others. We can circle back on any other questions you have there, but let's go back on your Q4 question. I'll turn it over to Chris. Sure. Larry any time. Hi, Richard. I'll just take that. On the ex-U.S., then 1 of the main differences is, as we had shared in the past, we did launch a manual test. Ex-U.S. particularly in Europe. We don't sell that in the U.S. and that is at a lower price competitive with manual -- manually read lateral flow test. So that's one, there's a product mix difference. And there is a slightly lower price, even on the base Veritor in some cases, given the way that those products are purchased in very large quantities on government -- country-based tenders. Therefore it gets a little bit better pricing, given the scale of the purchasing. So that's the main thing there on Veritor as we think about the mix. Again, we're really pleased that we're right in the revenue range that we project. We're actually ahead of what we projected at the beginning of the year and then have continued to be in that 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion outlook for the full year there. On your other question, Travis was uh? The operating margin. Chris, on that one. Yes. And we have said before, Travis, as well, we do have -- we very purposely kept a number of expenses on the P&L that stay at the GP line, that as Alaris does, is 510(k) approved. Those expenses will now get absorbed by the higher revenue as soon as the higher revenue starts to come through. Those expenses at stay on the GP line, for example, are very large service organization that we know we need. It's extremely experienced strong team, deep relationships with our customers. And we've kept that those expenses in place because we want that team in place to continue to service our customers, as we ultimately get the 510(k) approved, and back fully to market. Same thing on our commercial side, right? We've kept our -- while the revenue has gone down we've kept that commercial team in place. We have many, many people with decade-plus experience and long relationships with our customers who have great expertise in that -- not only that space, but overall medication management. And so we want to keep that expertise in place as we think about it long term. So those expenses, of course, as revenue ramps, we don't see the need to add those service or sales investments because we've actually kept them in place. Similar to what we had when it was at much higher revenue number. Yeah. Morning. Just a reminder, Matthew, we do have a COVID flu combination test, rapid test. Which we will can step -- that's in that flu category as well. So we do think even if there's a lighter flu season, the availability of symptoms; we will be testing for combination as well. We do expect there will be some continued testing of COVID only as well. But the ability to predict that number right now, again, we're not giving guidance. We just shared a floor number. If there is to predict how much standalone COVID testing is going to happen next year, it is not something one should do. Thanks for your question. Yeah. This is Tom. Appreciate the question there. I can give a little bit of color on what we're seeing overall, both in just general utilization, and then I'll talk about what we're seeing more recently in just the last 1 or 2 weeks. As I think most folks are aware, we have one of our informatics platforms is called MedMined which is a software that allows us to see real-time admission data, utilization data, test data, outbreak data, resistance data, literally real-time. It's hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And so some of the details that we see generally are over Q3. We saw about 91% to 92% utilization versus pre-COVID, about 92% exit in June. And that was a sequential improvement from Q2 average, which was in the 80's. And we expect to see further sequential improvement as we think about Q4 overall. In the non-acute sector it was already -- we saw a 105% utilization versus pre-COVID in May June, and sequential improvements from Q2, which was in the 95% range. As we think about the impact of -- and Europe by the way, with the data we look at show the bed utilization first pre-COVID utilization overall versus pre-COVID was estimated around 92%. Exited the quarter around 93%, which was sequentially up from Q2, which was about 86%. So as we think about the impact of COVID Delta variant in the last 1 or 2 weeks, we've seen it really, as was expected I think, when there would be outbreaks, that you'd start seeing them in concentrated geographic pockets. And that's certainly what you're seeing with the Delta variant. The last number I had was 16 meaningful U.S. healthcare systems that had stopped or significantly reduced elective procedures. And many of those, or the largest ones of those U.S. systems that have done that, that was as of last week, that was the number I had was 16. They were down in Florida, Louisiana, a [indiscernible] number of those were in the south. So it's -- we're seeing it in those areas, but not, certainly not across the country broadly. And we're not seeing really any significant change globally. Certainly there's pockets where that's happening, but for example in Europe, which is a major market for us we're not seeing a change there. We have built in some continuation of that into our guidance. And so if it doesn't continue at that level, that could be an opportunity. But again, being prudent as I think we've been all year long, we took an approach that said, well, if the Delta were to continue and there were to be some impact on procedural volumes, we would be absorbing that within our guidance. It would have to be a significant change versus what's being seen. We see that as built into our outlook map. And when we talk about the strong mid-single-digit performance next year, and continuing to help fuel our mid-single-digit growth profile. None of those acquisitions have any meaningful impact in Q3. Many of them closed, actually, either at the very end of Q3 or even more recently in Q4. So not an impact in Q3, and part of our growth equation, as we look going forward. But as you said, we're excited about the tuck-ins we're doing. It's combination of both strengthening our base business like what you see in Velano, offering really unique innovation and into an already extremely strong portfolio and a bag that we have. 2 areas that are entering us into new spaces. Like what you saw with Tepha or the ZebraSci, which both enters us into new spaces, but connect us deeply with an important customer segments, small biopharma, providing them services. That -- ZebraSci is the leader in providing them combination drug-device testing services allows us to build those relationships further. And as you know, many of the new drugs coming into the pipelines are in that small biotech segment that we think is attractive to invest behind. Thanks for the question. Thank you, Operator. Before we sign off and on behalf of the board and the entire executive team, I want to thank BD's 70,000 associates around the globe. This past quarter, I had a special opportunity to travel to a number of our sites, including our warehouse in Georgia, 2 of our plants in Nebraska, who've all been working tirelessly to produce essential medical devices.  Some that are being used for the pandemic response. And I'd like to say a special thanks to them and all of our manufacturing associates around the globe. They are the essential part of our frontline team and make me proud to be BD. And so I thank you, directly, on behalf of the entire organization. For all of you listening, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And thank you for joining in. Hope you have a great day."

            "name": "Chris Reidy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. I'm also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base business, which showed continued strong momentum. Third-quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased 26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis, and we're ahead of our expectations.  Our current quarter results also include 300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues compared to 98 million in the prior-year period. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods our base business revenues increased 17.6%. Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of last year.  The BD Medical segment revenues totaled 2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year. MDS revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and vascular care devices.  Additionally, worldwide revenues included 18 million from COVID vaccination devices. In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the expected declines in our Infusion Solutions.  As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and sets globally. Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales, and slightly better than expected market demand.  Pharm Systems continued to deliver strong growth with revenues up 12% driven by demand for our prefilled devices. BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%. This included the 300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, 212 related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining 88 million from BD MAX collection, transport, and swabs.  Year-to-date COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over 1.6 billion. Despite lower average selling prices driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion for the fiscal year. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27% driven by strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.  IDS revenues increased 49%. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit performance across Specimen Management and Microbiology. Biosciences increased 27% driven by both research and clinical solutions.  We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments as lab activity is returning to normal levels. We also continue to see steady demand for research re-agents globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic research and biopharma companies.  BD Interventional sales totaled nearly 1.1 billion and were up nearly 35% reflecting the COVID anniversary impact on elective procedures. Surgery revenues increased 68% and peripheral intervention increased 32%. Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter.  We saw sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention. However, in the last several weeks, we are seeing some impact from the COVID Delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states. Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our PureWick and targeted temperature management franchises.  Now, turning to our P&L, as we expected and as communicated, our gross margins this year are being negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances, and FX headwinds, which are more acute in the second half of the year. Also as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially.  Our gross margin was 51.5%. However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from an inventory provision related to COVID testing. Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%.  On a sequential basis, our base business gross margin declined from our second-quarter rate of 53.7% due to 3 factors. 70 basis points of incremental FX headwinds, 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material costs and inbound freight, as these costs rolled through our inventory, and 20 basis points of other expenses, including Alaris quality remediation.  Now, turning to SSG&A. Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to 1.2 billion or 25.2% of revenues. As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, we are continuing to see higher shipping costs.  This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment initiatives. As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY '21 will not re-occur. Our R&D spending totaled 321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis.  The higher R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD innovation and growth fund. Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.  On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth of 22%. Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%. The inventory provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier, negatively impacted operating margins by approximately a 150 basis points. Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at 98 million.  The adjusted tax rate was 5.8%, lower than we previously expected, due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. The lower tax rate essentially offsets the impact from COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $291.9 million.  We repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of 1 billion at an average price of approximately $242. Our adjusted EPS increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis, and were up 25.9% on a currency-neutral basis. Now, I would like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year.  Our guidance continues to assume no major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic. However, we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID Delta variant in the last one to two weeks in certain U.S. states, and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance.  That said, given the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14% up from our previous range of 10% to 12%. Our revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to 8% Further, we have reaffirmed our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion.  We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency. This brings our total reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%. For the full year, we now expect our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95. This higher guidance reflects the positive base business momentum and a lower tax rate.  These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices. Next, I wanna share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full-year fiscal '21 and provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits on our margins.  We expect our full-year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%. And this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing and reinvestments. We expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%.  This range includes a 200 basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments. Finally, I'd like to address FY '22. We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November earnings call. But we wanted to provide some directional color today.  To give you a sense as to what a floor could look like in fiscal '22, we have taken the following approach. As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing. Therefore, we have not modeled any testing revenue beyond the typical flu season.  With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '22 over our fiscal '21 base revenues, which as a reminder, adjust for COVID diagnostic testing revenues. With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions.  As we have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with [Indiscernible] timelines. However, as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately grant clearance. It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing. We are not assuming Alaris 510(k) clearance.  It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the medical necessity process. At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY '21. We believe it is prudent and responsible not to definitively predict FDA clearance timelines.  That said, we remain confident in our submission, and the process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k) clearance. We expect to drive base business gross, and operating margin expansion.  We expect the operating margin for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and translate into double-digit operating income growth. For reference, we expect our base business operating margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021.  With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted EPS floor of at least $12. This represents approximately low-teens growth over our expected base business earnings in fiscal 2021. Now before opening it up to Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on today's announcement of my upcoming retirement.  With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flows, which is evident by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've been doing and the restart of our sharp share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the right time for the transition as the Company is well-positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and impact the lives of patients around the world. I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to the new CFO.  And I'm very excited about the value creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to ensure the success as a member of their board. With that, let me turn it back to Tom. Thank you very much. Sure. Sure, Bob. Thank you for your comments too. Yeah. We -- as we think about margins, we do see the opportunity to get back to those 2019 margins over time, and we'll see that as Alaris comes back into the market, and as recode and our normal continuous improvement occur, and we'll see that improvement also as we grow mid-single-digits and we provide leverage that drops to the bottom line and that will also increase. There's a number of things that have pushed those margins down. We've talked about those in the past. You have Alaris, the ship hold. Obviously, there's an impact, but that will come back. We also have the drop in the China volume-based procurement is an impact, and obviously we're seeing some pressure from inflation, et cetera, that have run through. So, they have come down, but the model is intact, and we're very confident that we can drive those margins back to the '19 levels in the next -- in the near term as Alaris comes back and as we get the continuous improvement from Recode. Yes. So, a couple of things will help us improve. And the other thing that I should mention is there is some FX drag on margins as well, and that's been flowing through. But as we think about improvements going forward, we'll see improvements from utilization as utilization comes back. And so that will help -- will also comparatively to the margins that we have this year. We'll see continuous improvement, Recode kicking in. We'll see less one-time items. We took in a number of one-time items this year, the spending in the Veritor proceeds, et cetera, so those come back.  So you would expect to see us getting back to those kind of margins as Alaris kicks in, in '23, and we see that impact and as we make continuous improvement in '22 and '23. Thank you, sir. Sure. Yeah, I think it would be helpful to look at the flow from third quarter to the fourth quarter. We do expect margins to improve. I think we said that our margins would be 53 to 53.5. That's up a full point from the Q3 margins, and that's coming from improved utilization combined with some of our continuous improvement efforts. We'll also have less one-time airfreight that we saw in the back half of '21, and we will have some pricing actions as well. We do expect it to improve operating margins more than the normal 50 basis points relative to that '21 to '22, and that again comes from utilization. As that improves next year, there's less impact from FX. We have seen FX flowing through our inventory, and so you'll see that abate going forward. And then, we see our continuous improvement items offsetting any continued flow-through of inflationary pricing. When we look at the impact on our raw materials, resins as you know, is a big piece of that. Resins is a combination of some inflationary pressure, but it's also a function of other things; supply and demand in the oil market. And we took a big hit on that in '21, and we would expect that to abate somewhat, and that's something that we're watching very closely as we think about giving guidance in '22. Yeah. Vijay, I would just remind you that, going back in history, if you look at the Q4 of FY '19, that's a tough compare. That was the biggest MMS quarter for a number of reasons. And so that's what you're seeing as you're doing your calculation. Thanks Robbie, appreciate it. Sure. Thanks. Tom. And what I would remind you, Robbie, is that we have pointed to the fact that we are making investments this year and not to really look at the second half margins. We said they were going to be lower. You said not to use those as indicative base to jump off for '22, which is what we're saying today. The Q4 margins are pressured by an additional amount of COVID reinvestment. So we made that reinvestment announcement earlier. It takes a while. It tends to be back-end loaded, so there's a preponderance of reinvestment there in the quarter. We continue to see some drag from FX in the quarter, although less than the third quarter. We also expect to see the impact of inflationary costs running through our inventory. And we see that coming through in the fourth quarter as well. So when you sum all that up, we talked about the baseline of 21.5 to 22 as the jumping-off point. We said that it was more than our 50 basis point target going forward. And that -- how much more is where you have to plug it in to get to the $12 number that we gave as a floor. And I think Tom articulated what that $12 floor was meant to be. It doesn't have any testing assumption for COVID in it, although we would assume some water level of standalone testing. It also assumes the testing for flu and COVID combination, which is equal to a normal flu season. It's still pretty early to call that and that's something that we'll give more clarity on as we get into November. It is, just that, a baseline. We wanted to make sure people understood that we can grow more than normal off of '21. And get to at least that $12 level and to close out anything lower than that. And then we'll build from there as we give more specific guidance in November. I think you flow that through for this year. And then for next year, we should be -- we've traditionally guided 14% to 16%. I think you should consider that being at the low end of that range. Thanks Larry. Okay. There were multiple parts of that, I'm not sure I got them all. So let's start with -- I would say from the phasing, let's talk about the phasing. I think, it's still too early to tell. We can't give that kind of specificity for November. I would say, one of the things that I did mention was utilization. I do think that builds throughout the year, but that's as much clarity as I would give to that. What's the second part of the question? That does come back from that baseline and that's in the assumptions that get us to more than the normal 50 basis points. So that does go away and it does come back in margins. The difference between the -- weather it's the 56ish on gross margin or 25 to 26 on operating margin, is not really inflation it's more around the China VOBP, Alaris and some FX impacts that on the combination of those bring you down in the area of about a 150 basis points on a gross margin basis for example. If you take a step back, we're pulling all the levers that are necessary to drive that up. So the base business is doing well. That's a great foundation. We're reinvesting the Veritor proceeds that drive revenue growth going forward, but also to drive Recode and help there. We've got a balanced allocation strategy. You saw us buying back shares. That will help on the bottom line, we're divesting non-strategic businesses that will help with the growth profile going forward. So all of those things give us great confidence that we'll get back to those kind of margins in the near future as we take those steps. And we're headed in the right direction and the fundamental assumption of mid-single-digit growth on the top. And double-digit TSR in the bottom implies a certain amount of leverage that we feel very comfortable with. We feel good with that operating model, it's intact and that will drive margins up over time. Okay. I think you did a good job of it. That is the summary. You have exactly those parts and that is the headwind. The Alaris headwind is something that should come back to us in 2023 overtime. And I think you've got the parts. Yeah. I would refer you back to the prepared remarks because I think we were very clear as to what's included in that $12, and what is not included. The ability to estimate what testing is going to be next year is very volatile. Frankly, if you asked me two weeks ago, it would have been a different answer than it is today with the Delta variant, and it'll be very different in November. So when we give November guidance, we'll give you a better sense of that, but the floor is exactly what it is. It's no testing other than a normal flu season and nothing in for Alaris. And that's all I'll say about that. Thanks a lot. [Indiscernible] I think it's really an improvement in the margin year-in, year-out, and that's been the model. And we're very confident that we can return to that and to drive those margins back up to the '19 levels and beyond as we move forward. The operating margin from -- when it comes back, okay. Yes The only thing I would say is you're -- you should be thinking about when Alaris comes back that the -- it takes a while for the sales to ramp. And that's all I would say on that. I'll take that. The floor does not contemplate that. As we complete the spin and as we get closer to the spin, we will make adjustments to any kind of outlook or guidance that we have. The $12 relates to BDX as a whole. And as it relates to dilution, what we have said is that the dilution to RemainCo would be primarily stranded costs. We'll have transition service agreements in place, and we'll have some time to offset any potential dilution that we have during that transition services period of time. And more to come on that as we get closer to the spin date. And then the first thing I would do is just correct your statement that we didn't give guidance for '22. Using the term guidance is inaccurate. We just gave you a floor and a way to think about it. I just want to make sure that that's clear. And what we said was a normal flu season. And we have talked about in the past that, that normal flu season is in the range of $80 to $100 million and it remains unclear as to what type of flu season, flu/ COVID season we have. Last year, the flu season was basically nonexistent. That's why we outlined that assumption as clearly as we did. I'm not sure what you just said there, but I think the -- would there be some COVID testing standalone that's something we'll give insights going forward in November. Good morning, Matt. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to BD's Second Fiscal Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 13, 2021 on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (855) 859-2056 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 6334356.  I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Kristen Stewart, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms. Stewart, you may begin.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks Regina, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via webcast at bd.com. We have a lot of exciting news to discuss today. Earlier this morning, we issued two press releases. The first discusses our second quarter results of fiscal 2021. The second announces our intention to spin-off our diabetes business into a separate public company. You can find these press releases along with an accompanying presentation that we will be referring to during today's call on the Investor page of bd.com. Leading this morning's call today is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Given the announcement of the spin-off of our diabetes business, we will also have Dev Kurdikar, our Worldwide President of Diabetes Care, who has been named CEO of NewCo to provide his early thoughts on the transaction. Following our prepared remarks Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our three segment presidents, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical Segment; Simon Campion, President of Interventional Segment; Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences Segment. And before I turn it over to Tom, I want to address a few items. During the call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements and it is possible that these actual results could differ from our expectations. Risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and our SEC filings including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent Form 10-Qs. We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures that include details of our purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our earnings release and its financial schedules. They are also in the appendix of the Investor Relations presentation slides available at the bd.com website. Unless otherwise specified all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus relevant period. When we discuss revenue percent changes they are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. To avoid any confusion, when we refer to any given period, whether that's on a quarter or year basis, we will be referring to the period in fiscal terms, unless we specifically call it out as a calendar period. Finally, when we refer to NewCo, during today's call we are referring to the independent publicly traded diabetes company following the effective date of the spin, while RemainCo refers to BD post separation. And with all that said, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom. Tom?\nTom Polen: Thanks Kristen. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump right in. Our second quarter results came in better than expected and we delivered strong revenue and EPS growth. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our core business, and therefore, based on our first half results and our projections for the second half we are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. We are making steady progress on each of our growth initiatives, which include very purposely shifting our investments and portfolio into higher-growth categories and shifting our weighted average market growth rate over time. We are advancing our product pipeline as well as our tuck-in M&A strategy, which now includes making selective investments in earlier stage and potentially disruptive technologies. And this morning we announced our intention to spin-off our Diabetes Care businesses into a separate public company. We see this planned spin as a significant value-creating opportunity for all stakeholders for our patients, customers, associates and shareholders. As an independent public company, we believe the diabetes business can leverage its global leadership position and unleash its growth potential in this attractive market category through the more efficient allocation of its own capital. For RemainCo BD, this transaction allows us to focus on our prioritized core businesses. We expect this transaction to strengthen our mid single-digit revenue and double-digit total return growth profile. We expect the spin to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022 subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the BD Board of Directors and the SEC declaring our registration statement effective. We are progressing well against our simplification initiatives, which are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our product quality, refining our customer experience and improving cost efficiencies. Our recode initiatives are progressing on track to generate savings of $300 million by the end of FY '24. And these initiatives help unlock value and allow us the flexibility to reinvest back into our business to fuel future growth. Chris will talk more about our capital allocation strategy later in the call, but we expect share repurchases to return as part of a more balanced capital allocation strategy, as our balance sheet position and cash flows have strengthened over the past year. We also continue to be guided by our purpose of advancing the world of health and continue to make great progress on our ESG initiatives. On Earth Day, we reaffirmed our climate change targets, which includes our pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040 across our direct operations. Last week as I was preparing for our Board meeting, I reflected on where we were a year ago where we are today and the progress we've made. First, we achieved my number one priority since taking over as CEO. Last week, we announced that we submitted our Alaris 510(k) premarket notification. This is an important milestone in our commitment to our customers and our patients. The Alaris pump is the leading infusion pump in the US market administering more than one million infusions each day. Second, we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and cash flows. Over the past year we've improved our net leverage ratio by a full turn from 3.4x to 2.4x and taken actions to meaningfully strengthen our cash flows. Third, we answered the call to action with COVID. We developed a series of innovative COVID diagnostic tests and scaled these to diagnose patients and help control the spread. We secured our global supply chain to ensure that our essential medical devices were available to treat COVID patients in ICUs around the world including BD devices used in the treatment of an estimated 90% of US ICU patients. And today we continue to add capacity and enable over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered using our injection devices. I am very proud of our team's impact when it matters most. Fourth, we reinvested in growth. We set up the BD Innovation and Growth Fund and advanced impactful new innovation programs in each of our businesses. We acquired 11 tuck-in acquisitions since the beginning of 2020 along with early-stage investments and we're reinvesting some of BD Veritor profits back into the business and behind our BD 2025 strategy. Fifth, we started to shift the BD culture to one of a growth mindset. We've been systematically advancing our leadership capabilities and culture in this area which includes partnering with the Neuro Leadership Institute to embed an enhanced focus on innovation and growth across our culture and mindset and the progress we're making with shifting the culture is very real and tangible. And today, we are announcing our intention to spin-off the diabetes business. We believe this spin-off will be another value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. But what excites me most is not what we've done it's where we're going and what's to come over the next several years all of our future successes and milestones to come. The BD 2025 value-creation story has only just begun. And later this year we are planning to host an Investor Day and we'll look forward to sharing greater insights into our 2025 strategy and pipeline. So with that let's turn to Slide 8 and our second quarter results. Chris is going to run through our financial results in greater detail later on. But just to highlight, we are very pleased with our second quarter results as the BD team continued to execute well. Our second quarter revenues totaled $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. I was particularly pleased with the continued momentum of our core businesses which were above our expectations in all three business segments. To call out a few, our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Systems business continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. Medication Delivery Solutions business was up over 8%, as we continue to deliver on our COVID vaccine injection devices commitments and our results were also driven by higher patient acuity. Our Bioscience business turned in double-digit growth as research activity has rebounded and urology and critical care continued to perform well driven by PureWick and targeted temperature management. In China, where we began to anniversary the impact of COVID-19 we saw a strong revenue growth of 62% and we continue to invest support our future growth including reinvesting some of the profits from our COVID diagnostics. Our R&D spending was up 18.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EPS was $3.19 representing year-over-year growth of 25.1% on a reported and 22.7% on a currency-neutral basis. The performance of our business particularly our core, gives us comfort to reaffirm our fiscal 2021 guidance ranges which include currency-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted EPS guidance of $12.75 to $12.85, up 25% to 26% on a year-over-year basis. Turning to slide 9. As I discussed before, we are proud to play such an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, across the continuum of care, from diagnostics to treatment and now prevention. As vaccination campaigns continue to progress, I am pleased to announce, that we now have cumulative commitments for over 1.7 billion injection devices to administer COVID vaccines globally. These commitments will stretch through our fiscal 2022 period. And therefore, we now see higher demand in our MDS hypodermic business, as being durable into next year. We also see potential opportunity for our prefilled business in the future, and are now working with several partners at various stages of formulation testing on possible pre-filled COVID-19 vaccines. Turning to slide 10. I will provide an update on our COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing business. We recently announced several emergency use authorizations or EUAs from the FDA. We received EUAs for our combination COVID flu assays for both BD Veritor and BD MAX and we believe combination tests are going to be important in the next flu season. Next, we extended our EUA for the BD Veritor COVID-19 test to include a claim for screening asymptomatic individuals by serial testing. Several peer-reviewed publications have supported the benefits of serial rapid antigen testing, and we are continuing to develop our BD Veritor at-home test. Our test is designed to deliver a clear, digitally displayed record of test results on a smartphone to eliminate the reading guess work, and we also designed it to allow the data to be digitally shared by the user to eliminate errors and report sharing. Our BD Veritor at-home antigen test is also expected to have some other features that we believe will further differentiate it versus others on the market. Our antigen tests will all be manufactured on the same production lines to leverage economies of scale and our capital investments. Turning to slide 11. Growth through innovation is central to our BD 2025 strategy. We are advancing our R&D pipeline across all three of our segments. And as you can see on this slide identified by the green circles, several products have launched or achieved clearance since the beginning of the year. I've already covered our regulatory clearances related to COVID Diagnostics, and I'm happy to share that we've made steady progress in our medical segment, with a healthy cadence of relevant portfolio expansions and extensions across the MDS portfolio, such as the broadening of our leading peripheral IV catheter position with the introduction of our first passive safety catheter in the United States, the BD Cathena IV safety catheter. We launched a new catheter stabilization solution for peripheral IV catheters with the BD Secura stabilization device and further advanced the safety of the BD PhaSeal optimal product family with a locking injector. In interventional, we're launching Sensica, a smart connected folly catheter, which can be an important tool for the ICU. It provides weight-normalized urine output data that is one of the early parameters used by clinicians to help identify acute kidney injury. BD Sensica can wirelessly transmit this data to the hospital's electronic medical record. We're also looking forward to launching Pristine later this quarter. Pristine is our new long-term hemodialysis catheter with unique side hole-free symmetric wide tip distal lumen design. The design of the product is intended to help minimize thrombus adhesion, facilitate blood clot aspiration prior to hemodialysis treatment and help minimize recirculation rates in both forward and reverse. Turning to slide 12. As I have often said over the last year, Alaris was my number one priority and last week, we announced a very important milestone. We submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for our BD Alaris system. I am extremely proud of our MMS regulatory affairs, quality and R&D teams for their dedication and hard work, to ensure a comprehensive submission. We're also very appreciative of the FDA's collaboration. We recognize this is one important step and we look forward to working with them through the FDA review process to obtain clearance for the updated BD Alaris system. Just to give a sense of what is included in the submission and how comprehensive it is. The 510(k) submission is intended to bring our file up to date for all changes to the pump, since the last 510(k) was cleared. We are also implementing updated features and addressing open recall issues, including through a new version of the BD Alaris system software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. These updates are part of our overall commitment to safeguard infusion programming. And included in the software will be updates to our BD Alaris Guardrail Suite and BD Alaris EMR interoperability, including cybersecurity updates, network security and advanced data encryption. From a hardware perspective, our submission includes updated PCU, LVP, syringe and EtCO2 modules, as well as our existing PCA module. We plan to continue to advance the BD, Alaris system with future updates and subsequent submissions. We filed a substantial amount of data to support the filing. This is a complex and comprehensive submission. Therefore, we would expect that the FDA review process will take some time to complete. And while we're not intending to predict the FDA-specific time line, we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes and we believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. We plan to update you if there are any significant developments. And for now, we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity. We've learned a lot of valuable lessons and gained insights during this journey that we're applying to our ongoing next-generation pump platform programs as well as our quality and risk management systems. Turning to Slide 13. We are making significant progress with our tuck-in M&A strategy. Year-to-date, we've closed five acquisitions and we have a robust funnel of opportunities at various stages. We continue to exercise financial discipline, in addition to ensuring deals meet our strategic and operational criteria. This includes them being accretive to our growth profile, supporting our key innovation themes, advancing our strategic positions, meeting our financial hurdles and creating shareholder value. As part of building a more holistic approach to expanding our inorganic growth funnel, we also expanded our evaluation and selective investment in early-stage strategic opportunities. On Slide 14, we highlight our key innovation themes and with some of our tuck-in acquisitions and R&D products across our three business segments that align to these themes, some of which I've already highlighted. So within this theme of applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and artificial intelligence to improve care processes, I've already discussed our Smart Foley catheter Sensica. We also continue to develop new modules of Kiestra, our total lab automation system. Kiestra as you know can improve standardization, significantly enhance lab efficiencies and staff productivity. Within Medical, our health site platform is designed to continue to support enterprise-wide medication management. We continue to evolve our capabilities with health site diversions, which was originally launched in fiscal 2019 for Pyxis. We have scaled tremendously over the last year in terms of our commercial sites and we have plans to expand into the OR, followed by integration of infusion data and central pharmacy. Within this theme of enabling new care settings, you've seen us acquire Med Bank and GSL Solutions to expand our medication management offering into the faster-growth non-acute settings and strengthen our existing dispensing leadership position. Our PureWick dry dock urine collection system has been helping women with urinary incontinence outside of the acute setting and contributing to the strong growth in our UCC franchise. And I've already talked about how we're excited about the upcoming launch of our BD Veritor at-home COVID-19 test that enables the expansion of testing into everyday settings. Lastly our third theme is improving diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. I already mentioned Pristine and I've talked about in the past our BD Oncology HPV assay, which offers extended genotyping that supports risk stratification. And we look forward to launching this assay on our BD core system in the United States later this year. One other product that we haven't talked a lot about is our BD Libertas subcutaneous drug delivery system for the administration of viscous biologics. Our Pharmaceutical Systems business is excited to offer this option to our biopharmaceutical partners as a combination product. These products not only add value to our customers, patients and health care system but they add to our confidence in a sustainable, durable, mid-single-digit growth profile. Now turning to Slide 15. As I've described so far on this call, we are making substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy, which is about unleashing the growth potential of BD, delivering innovation to our customers, empowering our associates and creating value for our shareholders. And I'm really excited today to announce a bold step in our BD 2025 strategy. Our intention to spin-off our diabetes business to our shareholders which we believe is a value-creating transaction. Our Diabetes Care business generated $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, is a global leader in insulin injection devices. Consistent with our continuing focus on delivering shareholder value, we undergo strategic reviews to identify ways to create value and determine that the strategic priorities of BD have diverged from those of our Diabetes Care business. We believe a spin-off will position both companies for long-term growth and success by allowing both to focus on their respective core markets, innovations and customer outcomes. Each company will be able to more efficiently allocate its resources and capital, best positioning the respective companies for their success and value creation. We see tremendous potential to create value for our Diabetes Care business ahead. And let's turn to slide 16, to dive into some of the benefits in greater detail. We see the spin-off as an operating catalyst for our Diabetes Care business. As an independent public company, NewCo will be able to more effectively allocate its human, operational and financial resources to implement a refined growth strategy that will allow it to focus on innovation, and improving the care of patients living with diabetes. Being a separate entity, will also better enable NewCo to attract and retain talent, align management and employee incentives, and have a stock currency that it can use for future acquisitions. For RemainCo BD, we expect the spin-off to strengthen our mid-single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth. We estimate the uplift to our revenue growth rate to be about 30 basis points. And see this as strengthening our double-digit total return growth profile. The spin-off will allow RemainCo to focus on our R&D tuck-in M&A and customer growth strategies, simplify our overall focus and maintain financial flexibility. Considering all of these benefits, we believe this transaction has the potential to create value for our shareholders, which will be owners of both companies. Slide 17, provides an overview of the relevant transaction details. And I've already covered many of these topics. The spin-off is expected to be implemented by a means of a distribution of 100% of the shares of a newly traded -- publicly traded entity to BD shareholders, and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Over the next several months, we'll be filing our Form 10, which will include the carve-out financial statements. Again, we expect the spin-off to be completed in the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by the Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC. Turning to slide 18, NewCo will be led by an experienced management team. And I am very pleased to share that Dev Kurdikar, who joined us earlier this year, as the Worldwide President of Diabetes Care will be the CEO of NewCo. Dev has a long history, in the medtech sector, most recently serving as the CEO of Cardiac Science. Dev has been engaged with the business now for the last few months and will share some of his preliminary thoughts in a moment. I'm also very happy to announce that Jake Elguicze, the Former Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations of Teleflex, has joined BD and will be the CFO of NewCo upon spin. Jake brings extensive experience, in treasury, financial planning, reporting and analysis and investor relations. We're confident that Dev and Jake are the right team, to lead NewCo as they embark on this journey that we believe will create value for all stakeholders. So with that, I want to turn it over to Dev to provide his perspectives on today's announcement, Dev?\nDev Kurdikar: Thanks Tom, and hello to everyone listening to today's call. I'm incredibly excited to embark on this journey. I see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes. I'm also very humbled, to be leading this amazing organization. The Diabetes Care business has a long history of caring for patients living with the disease, dating back to BD's introduction of the world's first specialized insulin syringe, almost 100 years ago in 1924. Since then, BD has played a leading role in the delivery of insulin, including helping to drive the adoption of insulin pens, which utilize our pen needle technology, as a leading modality for insulin injection. Our Diabetes Care business now reaches more diabetic patients, than any other medical device company in the world today. We manufacture eight billion devices per year and are the global leader in insulin injection devices. As Tom mentioned earlier, the business generated nearly $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020, derived from the sale of insulin injection devices such as, pen needles and insulin syringes as well as other accessories. One factor that attracted me to this opportunity was the global breadth of the business with 48% of the revenues generated outside the United States, including 17% in emerging markets. And why is this important? As you can see on slide 21, diabetes is a growing chronic condition across the globe, with some of the higher prevalence rates expected to be in the emerging market regions. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to grow from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030 and 700 million by 2045. Most of these patients will likely continue to rely on traditional injection devices for their insulin needs. The rapid growth of the disease will likely place a significant burden on healthcare systems around the world, as patients with diabetes are often afflicted with multiple co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetic retinopathy and lower limb complications. While I've only been with the company for a few months now, I can assure you that my passion and vision for NewCo is one of growth. Injection devices like pen needle and syringes are likely to remain a key part of their treatment paradigm for people with diabetes on a global basis for the foreseeable future. We will look to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on these demographic trends. However, we'll also look to invest in novel insulin delivery technologies, including our internal type 2 patch technologies. We also plan to supplement our internal R&D product development efforts more broadly and accelerate our growth profile through strategic M&A to broaden our product offerings and enter adjacencies on new growth categories. Let me end by saying how excited and humbled I am to have this opportunity to lead NewCo. I am confident that our team will work tirelessly to advance care for our patients while building shareholder value. With that I'll turn it over back to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks Dev. We see this as a great opportunity for those BD associates that will be part of NewCo and we're happy to have you and Jake on board. Turning to slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives across BD. Over the past quarter, we continued to advance our company-wide ESG initiatives, including our recent commitment to be carbon neutral across direct operations by 2040. We also continue to make progress towards identifying our 2030 goals and we look forward to sharing more details behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. Before turning it over to Chris, I want to say again how proud I am of the organization for the progress we've made in advancing the BD 2025 strategy. We are purposely shifting our focus to growth opportunities. Simplifying the organization to remove complexity as I firmly believe complexity gets in the way of growth and we're empowering our associates with a growth mindset. We are committed to doing the right things, the right way and fulfilling our purpose of advancing the world of health. I also want to reiterate how excited I am for what's ahead for both RemainCo BD and NewCo. BD's Board of Directors and management team believe our plans to spin-off the Diabetes Care business will create value for all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Reidy: Thanks Tom. And before I turn to the results, let me also share my enthusiasm for the spin-off of our Diabetes Care business. I see the transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our patients. I'm confident that we have the right leadership to navigate NewCo on this exciting journey ahead. Now let me turn to the second quarter financial results. Slide 27 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Our revenues came in just over $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with our results. Our core segment results excluding COVID-19 diagnostic testings were ahead of our expectations across all segments. Now turning to slide 28. Our medical segment delivered 4.7% FX-neutral revenue growth led by our market leading BD Pharmaceutical Solutions Systems business, which continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. We are proceeding with our capacity expansion to support the future growth of this business unit. MDS grew a solid 8.1%, which included $43 million from COVID-19 vaccination injection device revenues. We also benefited from higher patient acuity and higher utilization internationally particularly in China where we anniversaried the impact of COVID-19. Now turning to slide 29. Our Life Science segment delivered revenue growth of nearly 38% on an FX neutral basis. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues totaled $480 million and are included in our Integrated Diagnostics Solutions business. While BD Veritor ASPs were as expected in the low to mid-teens, the market's overall demand for symptomatic COVID diagnostic testing was lower. Looking at our IDS business excluding COVID testing, our routine diagnostic testing has not yet fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. There was virtually no traditional flu this year, so we did not have our usual flu test revenues and this impacted our IDS growth rate by 540 basis points and our BD Life Sciences growth rate by 410 basis points. The impact to our overall BD growth rate was 110 basis points. Our Biosciences business unit delivered strong growth of over 12% as research lab activity has recovered nicely. We are seeing strong demand for research instruments and reagents as well as from biopharmaceutical companies for vaccine research and development. As shown on slide 30, the BD Interventional segment was flat this quarter, which was better than expected given the COVID-19 resurgences. The performance in surgery and PI reflected the early impact from the COVID resurgence. However, we did see recovery in elective procedures as the quarter progressed and this trend has continued into April. Our urology and critical care franchise continues to deliver solid growth led by our Purewick and targeted temperature management product lines. Turning to our results by geographic regions on slide 31. In the United States, revenues were up 1.9%. As we had discussed on our February earnings call, we did see some early impact from COVID-19 resurgence, which waned as the quarter progressed and we exited March with improved momentum and this continued in April.  International revenues were up 25.7% on a currency-neutral basis as we begin to anniversary the initial impact of COVID-19, particularly in China where our revenues were up 62%. We also benefited from our COVID-19 responses, our diagnostic testing and vaccine injection delivery device revenues.  Now turning to the P&L on slide 32. As expected our gross margin was sequentially lower as compared to our first quarter. Our gross margin was 53.8% driven mostly by the lower COVID diagnostic testing revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the gross margin included a 70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange and 70 basis points from reinvestment initiatives. Favorable impacts from our continuous improvement initiatives were offset by product quality-related expenses.  Our SSG&A spending rose 9% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, including a 380 basis point impact from deferred compensation, which as you know is fully offset in other income expense. The remaining increase in SSG&A is primarily related to higher shipping costs and investment spending as part of our BD Veritor profit reinvestments.  Our R&D spending ramped sequentially as planned as we reinvested some of the BD Veritor profits behind new pipeline innovations. R&D increased 18.7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis to $295 million, representing 6% of our revenues.  Our operating income grew 14.3% on a year-over-year reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Our operating margin was 24.5%, up 20 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. Deferred compensation was an 80 basis point headwind.  Our interest and other expenses totaled $111 million versus $170 million in the year ago period. The reduction of interest other net on a year-over-year basis, primarily reflects a decrease in deferred compensation offsetting increases in SSG&A as previously mentioned. It also reflects reduced interest expense due to debt repayment and refinancing activities and lower interest rates.  Our tax rate was 12% lower than expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. Our adjusted EPS increased 25.1% over the prior year to $3.19 on a reported basis and were up 22.7% on an FX-neutral basis. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $293.6 million.  Now turning to slide 33, I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation priorities, but first I want to update you on the great progress we made with our cash flows and balance sheet on a year-to-date basis. For the first half of the year, our cash flows from operations have more than doubled growing from $1.2 billion to $2.8 billion, driven by the improvement in our net income as well as working capital. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio was 2.4 times, a full turn lower than a year ago.  Going forward our capital allocation strategy will be more balanced than it had been in the past as we were paying down our debt. Now more of our cash can be deployed to support our growth strategy, tuck-in M&A, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases.  As a reminder under the existing share repurchase authorization plan, we have just under 7.9 million shares or roughly $2 billion remaining. Also note that we would expect BD's dividend to be unaffected by the diabetes spin-off and therefore would increase BD's payout ratio.  Next I want to address our fiscal 2021 guidance and provide some general commentary on our overall outlook, which you can see on slide 34. From a reporting perspective, we will continue to report our diabetes business with our BD results until the spin-off of the diabetes business is complete.  We're very pleased with the results for the quarter how we are building momentum in our core, advancing our pipeline and achieving critical milestones. We are also pleased with the early progress we see from BD Veritor profit reinvestments. We believe these projects should begin to provide incremental growth beginning in late 2022.  We are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 financial guidance ranges. We continue to expect reported revenue growth of 12% to 14% for the full year 2021. This reflects FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%. BD Veritor revenues towards the higher end of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range and foreign currency adding approximately 200 basis points. We also continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which represents growth of 25% to 26% year-over-year.  Now we wanted to give you some color as you consider your models for the back half of the year. We continue to reinvest some of the Veritor profits to fund projects in line with our BD 2025 strategic pillars of growth simplify and power. Our investments continue to put temporary pressure on both our gross and operating margins in 2021. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect our operating margins in the second half of the year to be in the low 20s, reflecting our reinvestment initiatives as well as higher raw material costs. As a reminder, we expect the reinvestment pressures that you're seeing on our margins to lift next year. As you've seen in the past from time to time there can be some volatility in our tax rate. We now expect our FY 2021 tax rate to be slightly lower than FY 2020's tax rate. This helps to offset some gross margin pressure from the lower ASPs from Veritor as pricing is now approaching compared to our flu test price a bit faster than we originally anticipated. Regarding 2022 given the momentum we are seeing our progress with our R&D pipeline the reinvestments of our BD Veritor proceeds and our tuck-in acquisition strategy we have increased confidence in our core outlook. In fiscal 2022, excluding COVID-19 testing and Alaris 510(k) clearance, we expect our revenues to grow solidly in the mid-single digits. As you heard Tom mention, while we're not intending to predict the FDA's time line we recognize the desire to have some input for modeling purposes. We believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' 510(k) clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal 2022. We believe it would also be prudent to model both our revenues and our margins gradually ramping as we scale our selling and manufacturing efforts. In conclusion, we are really pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum across our businesses. We are excited about our plans to spin-off of the diabetes business and see this as an important opportunity to create value for our shareholders. With that, Tom, Alberto, Simon, Dave and I are happy to take any questions you have. Operator, please open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nKristen Stewart: Hi, Bob. Good morning.\nBob Hopkins: Good morning. Boy a lot to unpack here. So I'll just ask kind of two straightforward questions. First is kind of a housekeeping on the diabetes side. You told us it was roughly 67% of revenues in fiscal 2020. I'm just curious what rough percentage of operating profit it was in that year? And then I've got one follow-up. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yeah. On that first one Bob, we'll be clearer on that as we do the carve-out financial statement. So you can expect to see that going forward. But as you know, we don't break it out at that level at the operating basis \u2013 on an ongoing basis. But as we do carve-outs that will be clearer.\nBob Hopkins: Any rough sense though just as I'm sure it will be \u2013 \nTom Polen: Too early to say right now as we're still going through the midst of that.\nBob Hopkins: Okay.\nKristen Stewart: And Bob \u2013 Bob just to note so maybe what we can say is that the Diabetes Care business it certainly is profitable and the gross and operating margins are above our corporate average. Certainly, the company's positive cash flow which is going to allow it to pursue the growth agenda that we discussed, and then again as we file the Form 10 later this year the more detailed carve out financials will be available then.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Great. And then one quick follow-up. So many things we could ask about 2021, but you offered a few little comments on 2022, so I'll skip right over to next year for a quick second. What do your comments suggest about the \u2013 kind of the outlook for operating margins next year relative to where you're ending in the back half of 2021?\nTom Polen: Yes. So as you can see this year, we're spending and investing to drive future growth from the Veritor proceeds. And so that will be something that does not reoccur next year so you will see a lift. And clearly, you would get a lift from Alaris coming back because that was a drag on our operating margins as well. And I would also add the \u2013 in terms of FX you see some FX pressure that we pointed out this year. We'll continue to see some of that rolling through our inventory for the remainder of this year. That should turn around next year as well.\nBob Hopkins: Any sense for what that roughly sums to though just directionally?\nTom Polen: Yeah. We're not going to give 2022 guidance this early. A lot of that will be impacted as you know by what happens to COVID testing. And we're pulling all the levers we can to make COVID testing more sustainable as we think about the combined COVID and flu assay and we're also \u2013 we're working on the at-home test. So that should have some ability to have sustainability in COVID testing. But clearly, it will come down. And where that goes will have a big impact on operating margins and gross margins in total as you would know.\nKristen Stewart: And Bob, just as a reminder, we've said, we expect to reinvest about $200 million of Veritor profits back into the business this year, right, which are onetime expenses hitting the R&D line as well as the GP line as we discussed that will come out next year, which will be obviously a tailwind. The re-launch of -- the expected re-launch of Alaris, obviously next year would also be a margin tailwind from that perspective as we start getting absorption back in that plant as well as it tends to be a higher-margin item. And so those are all positives as well as continued volume returning in as we think about the recovery post-pandemic, particularly in areas like BDI, which we saw and we can talk about later on. We saw good continued recovery, particularly in the back end of the quarter in March, and we continue to see that strong momentum and Simon can comment on that later on, as we look at April in procedure volume recovery. So thanks for the question, Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nKristen Stewart: Hey. Good morning, Robbie.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Good morning. As Bob said, there's a lot to unpack here. Maybe I could ask about some of the base businesses here, particularly maybe the Interventional business seemed a bit weaker than expected and the Medical business continues to benefit from COVID. So, I was wondering if you could tease out some of what's impacting interventional? And how do you expect that to recover? And then, on the flip side within Medical, how much of that is benefiting from COVID here and should start to come out over the balance of the year?\nDave Hickey: Yes. I can start with maybe just some comments on Medical, and then turn it to Simon on Interventional. So certainly, in Medical you see a couple of things happening. One is we see continued durable growth you saw last year in Pharmaceutical Systems. You saw it again in the quarter that they were in 8% plus I think last year growth, and we see that durably higher than average company growth is my intention there. And you saw us obviously communicate I think, it was last quarter or the quarter before, over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of incremental investment, capital investment in that business to support the long-term growth outlook. So that's number one. We also reaffirm that we expect -- we are in discussions and we have collaborations going on with several pharma companies about putting COVID vaccines in prefilled syringes. So again, another opportunity as we think about that business long-term. In MDS, we also commented that I remember, a year ago or less than a year ago, we were talking about that we could do up to one billion syringes to help in the COVID vaccination. We now -- today announced, we have orders -- commitments in hand for 1.7 billion syringes that spans well into FY 2022. And so we see, while we were wondering was there going to be a cliff of syringes into 2022, we see that demand in our MDS business as being durable into 2022. And certainly, as we think about potential even further demand, from things like booster shots, that would just make that demand even more durable. Overall, that business continues to do well in terms of taking share in the catheter space as well as a series of new innovations. They obviously had had some benefits from higher acuity patients in the ICU, which are maybe using products like midlines or PICCs, which have higher ASPs than peripheral catheters for shorter-time stays, but there's strong durable trends there I think in MDS. And obviously MMS, we look forward with the submission of the 510(k) to have bigger growth opportunities as we look ahead to 2022. I think I'll turn it over to Simon on BDI. But I would say what you saw is that the impact from the pandemic was very minimal in the first two months of the quarter last year for BDI. And so, I think you see just that comparable happening given our product mix. And then, we did see strong trajectory and uptake in March and we saw that continue into April. Simon.\nSimon Campion: Yes. Good morning, Robbie. It's Simon. So let me just add at the bottom here with UCC, a really strong quarter as you see driven by double-digit growth in PureWick and TTM. So, it will continues to be a mid to high single-digit performer for us this quarter. Peripheral, as Tom has mentioned, Peripheral we did see impacts early in the quarter in this space and particularly in the ESKD business and that is -- that should not be a surprise to you based on what you've probably heard from others involved in that space, but a sequential improvement through the end of March and into April and the outlook remained positive there. And then, with Surgery, no great surprise to us. Two factors driving that. Number one, hernia is not an emergent procedure. So, patients have had hernias for several years. So that is typically impacted first when a resurgence happens and they are treated later, when the recovery is initiated. And secondly, the Q2 of last year for us had a particularly high growth in ChloraPrep, I would say, higher than normal. So that's a bit of an offset, as we move into this quarter. But the sustainability of our business, I think, is demonstrated in China, for example, this past quarter. We were very significantly impacted in Q2 last year in China and it has rebounded really strongly in Q2 of this year. So we remain confident in our ability to recover our business as the resurgence abates here.\nChris Reidy: I would just add two comments. In terms of Interventional it actually exceeded our expectations in the quarter, because we had seen January and the resurgence from COVID and we had seen that going into the February call. And that did turn around in March and happy to see it turn around in April. But I'd also take a step back in terms of the core momentum and point to the fact that we see that improving. It's helping us with the outlook for the remainder of this year. And I would also point to the fact that we showed that confidence in what we said about 2022 by moving the core guidance for 2022 from low single to mid digits to solid mid-single digits. And that's reflective of the momentum across the business that we see as sustainable.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And I realize you're not going to be able to comment on COVID testing or Alaris sales necessarily for next year, but maybe if we think about the balance of fiscal 2021 here. I just want to make sure I have some of the data points right. One is that, at the high end of Veritor testing, that implies another $250 million or so in each of fiscal 3Q and 4Q. And as we think about a second half approval next year for Alaris, just maybe remind everyone about the process of how long it takes from order to delivery to booking revenue, just so we can appropriately scale up our sales and the models for next year? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Just so, Robbie, on the question around Veritor, just as a reminder, we've always used, and emphasized the word, towards the high end, not the high end, which is what you just calculated. So if you -- you're maybe a little bit less per quarter than what you said to get towards the high end of the range, right? But to your point, we're almost -- we ended the first two quarters at almost $1 billion of revenue on Veritor. So you could think, we're on basically roughly two-thirds of the way through that number halfway through the year, which gives us confidence in reiterating that towards the high end of that range. And as you said, it's maybe a little bit less than what you indicated, would be split by quarter there. On the Alaris, we do have a backlog of orders that we would be able to ship initially. And then as we think about upgrades, those are shorter install times than, let's say, Pyxis, so it would be a couple of months typically in that space, from an order to implementation for Alaris.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys.\nChris Reidy: Good morning.\nVijay Kumar: Good morning, Chris. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my question. One -- actually, a couple on the spin itself. I guess, the base business is now going to accelerate by 30 basis points. So if I look at the prior guidance of 5% to 6% top line, are we now looking at perhaps the base being north of 5.5%? And on the spinco I heard some comments on patch pump. What should the growth rate for spinco be? Is that going to accelerate the north of 5%?\nTom Polen: Yes. Go ahead, Chris, take that one.\nChris Reidy: Yes. Let me take the first one. So you're absolutely right. We put in that, there would be growth of 30 basis points. And just think of that as a $1 billion or so of revenue, which has been relatively flattish compared to the rest of the $17 billion growing that mid-single digits. If you do that math, you can see the drag that that has of 30 basis points. And I would remind you that, our guidance is a recurring mid-single-digit kind of growth rate and so that 30 basis points gives us greater confidence in the ability to achieve that on an ongoing regular sustainable basis. So that's a positive. We haven't addressed the growth rate of spinco going forward. You heard Dev say that his emphasis is on growth. And we think that, being a separate public company, it unleashes that growth potential, because right now spinco would be fighting or diabetes care within BD is fighting for investment against other items that we are -- feel more strategic. So as a separate company, it can invest, whether that is internally more investment in R&D or through M&A, it can do that. So more to come on the growth profile of spinco as a separate entity, but that's kind of directionally the way to think about it.\nTom Polen: And, Vijay, you did ask about the -- this is Tom, about the patch. So that does continue in -- the patch pump. That continues in our pipeline with external development partner, as we've shared in the past. And certainly, as we approach the actual timing of the spin, you can expect that there will be further discussions on the strategy of the diabetes business and updates on that and other products within our R&D pipeline and on Dev and his team's vision for the business post spin. But those discussions as is typical in these situations wouldn't happen until we get closer to the spin.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Tom. And maybe a follow-up. I think the press release noted the transaction to strengthen the mid-single top-line and double-digit TSR profile. Just wanted to clarify are there any dissynergies? I'm assuming there are some. I know in the past you had spoken about double-digit EPS. Is that still intact on an underlying basis? Perhaps parse out the double-digit TSR versus what it means for EPS.\nChris Reidy: Yes. So as we said this strengthens -- the spin actually strengthens and gives us more confidence in both the top-line and the bottom-line. And that will be clear as we talk about the operating margins as we said from the SpinCo. So this gives us more confidence in that and so it supports that effort.\nVijay Kumar: There is no change from prior LRP correct?\nChris Reidy: You did mention Vijay that the stranded cost there would be some stranded costs in any transaction like this. We feel good about the fact that we can address those stranded costs. And obviously, we'll have a couple of years of TSA agreements that will mitigate those for a couple of years. So we're not concerned about stranded costs having an impact.\nTom Polen: And Vijay as a reminder we've been reaffirming ever since I've been in the role mid-single-digit revenue growth double-digit TSR and reaffirming that this actually strengthens our position on both of those. So the Diabetes Care was growing below the company on revenue and on operating income.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. \nTom Polen: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on the diabetes spin, one on the underlying growth assumed in the guidance for fiscal 2021. Just to start with the diabetes spin. Tom diabetes is seen as a high-growth area. It did grow 3% before 2020 for a few years. Why not invest in it? I mean the slide presentation suggests that this is an attractive area.\nTom Polen: Yes. So it's a great question. As we think about other opportunities in the company that we have whether or not it's across our Interventional segment and just the tremendous technology opportunities that are happening there in our BD Medical segment as well future of medication management and the opportunities in the non-acute space, the opportunity again to apply automation and informatics across both our Interventional and Medical and our Life Science business are significant for us. We see very attractive opportunities in those areas. And also of course diabetes business as we look at it, it has a more unique business profile relative to our other franchises. So, for example, they have very distinct patients, physician and distribution channel dynamics as compared to our other businesses. As you think about our BD Medical, excluding Diabetes, our Interventional and our Life Science franchise they have very significant overlap in call points right? They all call on health care systems. It's where we sell the majority of our Life Science products, our Interventional products and our BD MMS and MDS products into that channel. That's very different than diabetes. And as we think about that digital footprint that we've been building out how we're leveraging data and connectivity connected into electronic medical records across the segments that's also a different dynamic than what we see in the diabetes care business, which is again it's not connecting into EMRs in the same way, it's more directly outbound in the patient. And as you think about future technologies like patch pump or other options they also will require a very different commercial channel than is the -- what's inherent in the rest of the BD businesses be the eye life sciences or the rest of Medical. So we think that absolutely there are tremendous opportunities for BD Diabetes Care business which is why we're excited that spinning them will be -- allow them to unleash that potential not competing with other programs in the company allowing them to attract the best talent, reinvest their profits back into driving their strategy in a very focused way and will allow RemainCo BD to also be more focused in executing our strategy. So that's why we again reiterate why we're so excited about this being a tremendous opportunity for not only the business, but for our shareholders and our associates.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful, Tom. And Chris what are you assuming for the underlying growth ex-COVID testing in fiscal 2021? I'm getting about 4% at the high end. But this -- if I'm doing the math right it implies about let's call it flat sequential underlying sales in fiscal Q3 and Q4, I'd call it $4.4 billion. But your sales typically increase in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4 if I look at historical seasonality. So is this math right? And is this just conservatism given the recovery that we're seeing. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nChris Reidy: Sure. So, number one is that the core is actually accelerating and so the growth rate in the core will be ramping and we're now saying we'll end the year at mid-single digits in the core. So, a couple of things going on as we think about and contemplate the remainder of 2021. So, number one that core momentum is increasing. We did mention that Veritor is still within that towards the high end of that 1% to 1.5% range. But it has moderated slightly as volumes have come down a bit from the last time we gave guidance. And so that offsets that a little bit. And when you're looking at the pure dollars it's that Veritor testing and the COVID testing that's impacting the pure dollars. So, the bottom-line is -- the good news is the momentum is in the core moderating slightly on COVID testing as we look out the second half of the year. You put all those together and we're right where we said we would be in terms of both the topline and the bottom-line. On the bottom-line, we're also seeing a little bit of an impact on the profitability of Veritor as the prices begin to move more rapidly towards the typical flu pricing. And so that's having an impact and that's being offset in the second half of the year. So, we're still within the guidance range on the top and the bottom.\nKristen Stewart: And keep in mind Larry too in Q3 there is that large amount of revenues associated with medical necessity in MMS so that does have a little bit of upticks--\nChris Reidy: On a year-on-year basis. Last year there's a very large -- yes.\nKristen Stewart: And stronger revenues for the second half of the year in MMS too for the European revenues too for pumps.\nTom Polen: That's when pandemic was in it's in its peak. Yes.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: Hi good morning. Just maybe going to the tuck-ins that you've been executing on and I'm sure you'll get a little bit more into this when you have your Investor Day later on this year. But is there any particular asset amongst the five that you did year-to-date and I think you pointed to six last year? Anything that's more needle-moving or that will be contributing in your mind as we head into fiscal 2022? And then also how should we think collectively of what these might be able to add in terms of basis points to growth on top of that mid-single-digit normalized rate in 2022 just ballpark?\nTom Polen: Yes. So, we obviously view that as a form of -- we think about organic and inorganic innovation opportunities as both fueling that growth profile that we have and that we've defined. I think as we think about just the five that we've done this year, obviously, six last year, there are a number of them that are meaningful within the businesses that we have. We're really excited about the new catheter for example in BDI in their Peripheral Intervention business which is where that will show up. It's going to be a great product for them. It's really a breakthrough technology that's in a market that again is growing much faster than the company average. As we think about the two acquisitions in MMS that get us into the non-acute medication management area. That's an area that's growing much faster than the acute care medication management. As we've made very clear in our strategy helping to enable the shift of care into the non-acute sector is important to us. And we want to have a continue our leadership in the acute but be the leader also in enabling the trend that's happening building up the capabilities in the non-acute sector. And so those two acquisitions I think we'll look back on as being very strategic in enabling that. And both of those markets are growing in the teens. So, again, very positive growth rate there. And there's a couple that we haven't disclosed yet and you can see on the slide 13 that we had shared products like an infection prevention product. We haven't launched a new infection prevention product for a while. Obviously, our ChloraPrep franchise and a great commercial organization that drives that product globally. This will be a nice new addition to their bag and we'll talk about that forthcoming just like we did with Pristine. We had acquired that last year but we didn't announce it until now until we're actually launching it. So we'll do the same there. And the same factor with a new vascular access product that we're excited about that we just closed in the last month or so which we'll talk about very forthcoming as we bring that to market. So a number of different opportunities all very relevant in driving our business strategy. All of those acquisitions are participating in markets and we expect to grow faster than the BD average and again, it's part of our growth strategy.\nRichard Newitter: That's helpful. And then just looking forward, do we think of now that you're obviously grooming the portfolio a little bit with the diabetes planned spin-off now, do we kind of think of you guys as potentially moving up the size of the kind of the M&A target pool that you'll be willing to do going forward into 2022 and beyond once the spin-off occurs?\nTom Polen: Yes. Richard, we're still very focused on tuck-in M&A. Obviously, for us as a company of our size, tuck-in M&A can be probably in a couple of billion-dollar range in terms of deal size, but we certainly are not looking to do anything on the transformational side of like a CareFusion or Bard-type size. And that's very consistent with the strategy that we've communicated. Could you see larger tuck-in M&A deals than what we've done to date? Yes, but they would still be tuck-in M&A.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one question on Alaris and one follow-up. On Alaris, a lot of focus there some great updates by the Becton team today. I was just wondering if you could help us understand, how much of a drag the Alaris mediation has been on the core business's organic revenue growth? And just thinking about coming back on board in the second half of fiscal 2022 and how to attempt to forecast that return might help just to understand what the drag has been. I mean, may be difficult to parse out just because the pandemic the medical necessity orders et cetera, but any help there would be really appreciated.\nTom Polen: Sure. I'll turn it over to Chris to share some thoughts on the -- that element that there certainly has been a drag and we've been investing. As we've shared we have a team of over 200 people who have been working on that submission. They'll continue to be engaged in responding to any FDA questions. And obviously, we'll pivot them towards innovation opportunities as we move forward beyond that as well. But maybe just another point as you think about the timing of it, I can give a little bit more color is, if you look back right just factually look back and say over the last few years, how long has the FDA taken to clear pumps. And the date -- the clearance time ranges from 161 days to 412 days. So those are the facts. So call it 5.5 to 14 months. So that's a little bit of the logic. While we're not predicting the FDA time line right now, clearly the timing of approval within FY 2022 will have a meaningful impact in the answer to your question in terms of how we see the recovery and how much that contributes in 2022. And again, as I mentioned before, as we get further in the review process we'll provide updates as we can. But right now we're saying it will be prudent based on again historical clearance timings as I just described. So think about the clearance during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. So Chris, maybe any comments on the drag that it's been...\nChris Reidy: Yeah. Just to give a little bit on the revenues the -- in last year, we had medical necessity revenues of about $130 million or thereabouts. And don't forget, we had some non-medical necessity earlier in the year. So you're thinking about $200 million of revenues last year. The run rate prior to that was about $450 million thereabouts. So you could see that step down. And then this year, we see less medical necessity a little bit over $60 million or so in the first half of the year. We see that tailing off in the second half of the year. So that gives you some things to work with to show that there is certainly a drag on growth rate from the step down offset by some of the medical necessity revenues, but certainly a step down in both 2020 and 2021. As you think about next year, what we were giving you a sense of is that we think it's prudent to model that as during the second half of the year. It could happen sooner, we'll work to try to make it happen sooner, but it's prudent to think about it in the second half of the year. And we did point to the fact that there is some ramping that will happen. The good news is that we'll get the full year benefit of that coming back to us in FY 2023 regardless. But we do expect to see some of that ramping in the second half of the year.\nKristen Stewart: Great. Thank you, Josh.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks a lot. Pretty helpful.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nTom Polen: Hey, Matt. Good morning.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to circle back on the spending comments and see if we could get some help on understanding how you're going to reinvest the Veritor profits over the next couple of quarters, the impact on the margin. So maybe the way to ask this question would be to start with how much of the $200 million have you spent already, or just to ask spending was about flat sequentially. Is that a good way to think about modeling the second half and getting to that low 20s margin?\nChris Reidy: So we did give some insights into the impact of that spending. We did point to a lot of folks don't realize that some of that actually hits our gross margin and so we pointed to the fact that there was a 70 basis point hit to the gross margin number within Q2. We -- the way to think about that spending in the $200-plus million is that it is more ratable. We do see some -- you would expect some of that to ramp a bit. And so we're not being precise about exactly how much was in each quarter. But it is -- there's more to come. And so it is putting pressure on the margins which is why we're saying that the guidance for the second half is what it is as we expected it would be. So it is important to keep in mind that that investment that we're making does drive future growth, it's not something that will impact margins going forward. It's not going to repeat. And it is as a result suppressing both gross margin and operating margins this year.\nMatt Taylor: Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then I want to ask one on the guidance slide that you have here saying that, you're assuming that the acute care-oriented businesses do not return to pre-COVID levels. I guess can you talk about how close they're going to get to that, or when you think they will return to pre-COVID levels, or just recent trends it sounds like April was a continuation of March. Anything like that to help us kind of triangulate how the recovery is expected to progress.\nChris Reidy: Sure. So we have seen some improvement in utilization in March for example and that continue in April. But as we said, we don't expect that to get back to the 100% level. It does get up into the 90s by the back end of the year. We're more in the 80s, high 80s now. So we expect that to start creeping back but not completely get back in the second half of the year.\nTom Polen: And there are areas as we look at that maybe Simon \u2013 it's something we monitor very, very closely. We feel very good in terms of where we're \u2013 in all of our categories, particularly on the \u2013 all of our categories overall. But on the procedural side, we feel very good about our share positions and where we're trending there. So maybe Simon to comment what you see from a recovery because it does vary. We do have some areas that are at 100% of prior year today and some procedure areas that just take a little bit longer. Again, I think that's associated with the severity of the condition as it still opened up and it varies on geography as well.\nSimon Campion: Yes. So obviously, our European business was disproportionately impacted I think in the last quarter. But as Tom alluded to, we do track this every couple of weeks. We've done monthly surveys with customers. And sequentially, as I noted earlier on, it has improved across the two main businesses that are impacted PI and Surgery and some aspects of those businesses or some platforms did strike 100% of pre-COVID levels in March and that continues into April. As I noted earlier, hernia is one of those areas that's severely impacted early and recovers late. So that's a bit of a laggard. But in general, the procedures that are critical to health care are coming back. And not only do we see it in our numbers but the survey data that we gather from physicians and we typically survey about 300 a month, they are indicating that their volumes are rebounding. And obviously, patients that were put on hold are now going to start to come back over the next four to six months as well. So it's \u2013 we're in a reasonable spot.\nTom Polen: Very good.\nMatt Taylor: Thank you, guys.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, Matt\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nTom Polen: Hi, Matthew. Good morning.\nMatthew Mishan: Good morning and thank you for squeezing me in. First just a quick clarification. The revenue growth of mid-single digits for FY 2022 excluding Alaris and testing, obviously testing is like the negative. But is Alaris a good guy or a bad guy for next year? Because I think first half would be less medical necessity but then you have the timing of the FDA.\nTom Polen: So we would expect that to be a net good guy.\nChris Reidy: Yes, a net good guy. So when we're doing that we're saying specifically excluding the COVID testing, which will get more clarity on as we go forward. And excluding the come back of the 510(k) from Alaris. So that would be incremental to that mid-single-digit core growth.\nTom Polen: Yes. We will continue of course to ship under medical necessity for those customers that qualify. But once we get the 510(k), which again, will have more clarity on the exact timing of that, which will be meaningful. To answer how much of that will fall in 2022, we certainly expect a full year in 2023. But stay tuned on that but in any situation we would expect it to be a positive.\nMatthew Mishan: Okay. And then just your thoughts on Alaris' impact on the overall portfolio. Think of it like a Pyxis. Did it have a negative impact on the Pyxis? And when it comes back will it have a broader portfolio impact outside of just Alaris?\nTom Polen: Yes. We have seen no impact. Of course, the customers have very, very broadly stuck with Alaris. Alaris is the market-leading product for a reason. We've talked about the percentage of infusions, particularly in the US that happened with Alaris and it's a tremendous number. And customers \u2013 we do expect the majority of customers to upgrade to the new product as we end up launching that, hopefully in 2022, as we noted is our expectation. So because of that we don't see any impact on Pyxis. Obviously, there is a great value that one gets from having the full BD enterprise medication management suite that allows you to do things like diversion analytics and other parts of our HealthSight platform to use data from not only dispensing but infusion, as well as our software that's in the central pharmacy. And so all of those things remain the case going forward and we think customers will continue to see strong value in that.\nMatthew Mishan: Thank you very much.\nKristen Stewart: Operator, we'll take one last question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Jason.\nJason Bednar: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question, squeeze me in. I'll just start with one on the spin and then I'll have a follow-up. Just on the spin what should we be thinking about for the balance sheet for NewCo? You mentioned NewCo has the flexibility to make investments and advance the strategy, but also seems reasonable that maybe some level of debt will transfer over to the Diabetes Care business. So are those decisions made, or will they still be kind of in-process? How to think about that?\nChris Reidy: Yes. So no that's -- those are decisions that will come as we move forward and we'll provide more details on that closer to the spin date. We do expect that the capital structure along with the existing cash profitability will provide them the flexibility to pursue inorganic growth opportunities. So we want to make sure that they have that kind of flexibility and then it will be part of what goes into the equation in terms of how much debt they'll carry.\nJason Bednar: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then what's the right time line to think about for the at-home COVID test? I know it's still in development, but just timeline there. And then what's the right way to think about the go-to-market effort? We do have a proxy out there with an at-home offering that has an established price point. So do you come in at a similar level, or do you have a feature set that maybe justifies a higher price point?\nTom Polen: Yes. We -- so as has been our practice until we get the EUA in hand we don't project a specific launch timings. But we've been very active in development on that for a bit. It's been advancing very well in our pipeline. And so stay tuned as soon as we get an EUA for that product. You and everyone else will be among the first to know on that. And obviously, we are taking actions to prepare for that channel which we recognize is a unique channel versus the other ones and we're taking those actions to prepare for that launch. So we think we'll be well positioned when we do get the EUA and stay tuned. We'll look forward to announcing that.\nJason Bednar: All right. Thanks so much.\nTom Polen: Okay. Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay. Well thank you everyone for the excellent questions. And before we sign off I would be remiss not to wish, Vince Forlenza a wonderful retirement. And I expect that Vince is listening. Vince's last day on the BD Board was last week and I've mentioned in the past that Vince's leadership transformed BD. And I'm also grateful for the time, I got to work alongside him and for his mentorship. So on behalf of everyone at BD I just want to wish Vince all the best. And lastly, on behalf of the Board and the entire executive team I want to thank BD's 70,000 plus associates around the globe. Your efforts and sacrifices have not gone unnoticed. We are making great progress. We're making meaningful impacts for our customers. And most importantly, we are advancing care around the world. I've never been more excited about what lies ahead for us. For those who remain part of BD and for those that will ultimately become part of NewCo these are exciting times. And I hope everyone stays safe and healthy and thank you for listening today.\nOperator: This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks Kristen. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump right in. Our second quarter results came in better than expected and we delivered strong revenue and EPS growth. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our core business, and therefore, based on our first half results and our projections for the second half we are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. We are making steady progress on each of our growth initiatives, which include very purposely shifting our investments and portfolio into higher-growth categories and shifting our weighted average market growth rate over time. We are advancing our product pipeline as well as our tuck-in M&A strategy, which now includes making selective investments in earlier stage and potentially disruptive technologies. And this morning we announced our intention to spin-off our Diabetes Care businesses into a separate public company. We see this planned spin as a significant value-creating opportunity for all stakeholders for our patients, customers, associates and shareholders. As an independent public company, we believe the diabetes business can leverage its global leadership position and unleash its growth potential in this attractive market category through the more efficient allocation of its own capital. For RemainCo BD, this transaction allows us to focus on our prioritized core businesses. We expect this transaction to strengthen our mid single-digit revenue and double-digit total return growth profile. We expect the spin to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022 subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the BD Board of Directors and the SEC declaring our registration statement effective. We are progressing well against our simplification initiatives, which are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our product quality, refining our customer experience and improving cost efficiencies. Our recode initiatives are progressing on track to generate savings of $300 million by the end of FY '24. And these initiatives help unlock value and allow us the flexibility to reinvest back into our business to fuel future growth. Chris will talk more about our capital allocation strategy later in the call, but we expect share repurchases to return as part of a more balanced capital allocation strategy, as our balance sheet position and cash flows have strengthened over the past year. We also continue to be guided by our purpose of advancing the world of health and continue to make great progress on our ESG initiatives. On Earth Day, we reaffirmed our climate change targets, which includes our pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040 across our direct operations. Last week as I was preparing for our Board meeting, I reflected on where we were a year ago where we are today and the progress we've made. First, we achieved my number one priority since taking over as CEO. Last week, we announced that we submitted our Alaris 510(k) premarket notification. This is an important milestone in our commitment to our customers and our patients. The Alaris pump is the leading infusion pump in the US market administering more than one million infusions each day. Second, we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and cash flows. Over the past year we've improved our net leverage ratio by a full turn from 3.4x to 2.4x and taken actions to meaningfully strengthen our cash flows. Third, we answered the call to action with COVID. We developed a series of innovative COVID diagnostic tests and scaled these to diagnose patients and help control the spread. We secured our global supply chain to ensure that our essential medical devices were available to treat COVID patients in ICUs around the world including BD devices used in the treatment of an estimated 90% of US ICU patients. And today we continue to add capacity and enable over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered using our injection devices. I am very proud of our team's impact when it matters most. Fourth, we reinvested in growth. We set up the BD Innovation and Growth Fund and advanced impactful new innovation programs in each of our businesses. We acquired 11 tuck-in acquisitions since the beginning of 2020 along with early-stage investments and we're reinvesting some of BD Veritor profits back into the business and behind our BD 2025 strategy. Fifth, we started to shift the BD culture to one of a growth mindset. We've been systematically advancing our leadership capabilities and culture in this area which includes partnering with the Neuro Leadership Institute to embed an enhanced focus on innovation and growth across our culture and mindset and the progress we're making with shifting the culture is very real and tangible. And today, we are announcing our intention to spin-off the diabetes business. We believe this spin-off will be another value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. But what excites me most is not what we've done it's where we're going and what's to come over the next several years all of our future successes and milestones to come. The BD 2025 value-creation story has only just begun. And later this year we are planning to host an Investor Day and we'll look forward to sharing greater insights into our 2025 strategy and pipeline. So with that let's turn to Slide 8 and our second quarter results. Chris is going to run through our financial results in greater detail later on. But just to highlight, we are very pleased with our second quarter results as the BD team continued to execute well. Our second quarter revenues totaled $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. I was particularly pleased with the continued momentum of our core businesses which were above our expectations in all three business segments. To call out a few, our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Systems business continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. Medication Delivery Solutions business was up over 8%, as we continue to deliver on our COVID vaccine injection devices commitments and our results were also driven by higher patient acuity. Our Bioscience business turned in double-digit growth as research activity has rebounded and urology and critical care continued to perform well driven by PureWick and targeted temperature management. In China, where we began to anniversary the impact of COVID-19 we saw a strong revenue growth of 62% and we continue to invest support our future growth including reinvesting some of the profits from our COVID diagnostics. Our R&D spending was up 18.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EPS was $3.19 representing year-over-year growth of 25.1% on a reported and 22.7% on a currency-neutral basis. The performance of our business particularly our core, gives us comfort to reaffirm our fiscal 2021 guidance ranges which include currency-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted EPS guidance of $12.75 to $12.85, up 25% to 26% on a year-over-year basis. Turning to slide 9. As I discussed before, we are proud to play such an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, across the continuum of care, from diagnostics to treatment and now prevention. As vaccination campaigns continue to progress, I am pleased to announce, that we now have cumulative commitments for over 1.7 billion injection devices to administer COVID vaccines globally. These commitments will stretch through our fiscal 2022 period. And therefore, we now see higher demand in our MDS hypodermic business, as being durable into next year. We also see potential opportunity for our prefilled business in the future, and are now working with several partners at various stages of formulation testing on possible pre-filled COVID-19 vaccines. Turning to slide 10. I will provide an update on our COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing business. We recently announced several emergency use authorizations or EUAs from the FDA. We received EUAs for our combination COVID flu assays for both BD Veritor and BD MAX and we believe combination tests are going to be important in the next flu season. Next, we extended our EUA for the BD Veritor COVID-19 test to include a claim for screening asymptomatic individuals by serial testing. Several peer-reviewed publications have supported the benefits of serial rapid antigen testing, and we are continuing to develop our BD Veritor at-home test. Our test is designed to deliver a clear, digitally displayed record of test results on a smartphone to eliminate the reading guess work, and we also designed it to allow the data to be digitally shared by the user to eliminate errors and report sharing. Our BD Veritor at-home antigen test is also expected to have some other features that we believe will further differentiate it versus others on the market. Our antigen tests will all be manufactured on the same production lines to leverage economies of scale and our capital investments. Turning to slide 11. Growth through innovation is central to our BD 2025 strategy. We are advancing our R&D pipeline across all three of our segments. And as you can see on this slide identified by the green circles, several products have launched or achieved clearance since the beginning of the year. I've already covered our regulatory clearances related to COVID Diagnostics, and I'm happy to share that we've made steady progress in our medical segment, with a healthy cadence of relevant portfolio expansions and extensions across the MDS portfolio, such as the broadening of our leading peripheral IV catheter position with the introduction of our first passive safety catheter in the United States, the BD Cathena IV safety catheter. We launched a new catheter stabilization solution for peripheral IV catheters with the BD Secura stabilization device and further advanced the safety of the BD PhaSeal optimal product family with a locking injector. In interventional, we're launching Sensica, a smart connected folly catheter, which can be an important tool for the ICU. It provides weight-normalized urine output data that is one of the early parameters used by clinicians to help identify acute kidney injury. BD Sensica can wirelessly transmit this data to the hospital's electronic medical record. We're also looking forward to launching Pristine later this quarter. Pristine is our new long-term hemodialysis catheter with unique side hole-free symmetric wide tip distal lumen design. The design of the product is intended to help minimize thrombus adhesion, facilitate blood clot aspiration prior to hemodialysis treatment and help minimize recirculation rates in both forward and reverse. Turning to slide 12. As I have often said over the last year, Alaris was my number one priority and last week, we announced a very important milestone. We submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for our BD Alaris system. I am extremely proud of our MMS regulatory affairs, quality and R&D teams for their dedication and hard work, to ensure a comprehensive submission. We're also very appreciative of the FDA's collaboration. We recognize this is one important step and we look forward to working with them through the FDA review process to obtain clearance for the updated BD Alaris system. Just to give a sense of what is included in the submission and how comprehensive it is. The 510(k) submission is intended to bring our file up to date for all changes to the pump, since the last 510(k) was cleared. We are also implementing updated features and addressing open recall issues, including through a new version of the BD Alaris system software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. These updates are part of our overall commitment to safeguard infusion programming. And included in the software will be updates to our BD Alaris Guardrail Suite and BD Alaris EMR interoperability, including cybersecurity updates, network security and advanced data encryption. From a hardware perspective, our submission includes updated PCU, LVP, syringe and EtCO2 modules, as well as our existing PCA module. We plan to continue to advance the BD, Alaris system with future updates and subsequent submissions. We filed a substantial amount of data to support the filing. This is a complex and comprehensive submission. Therefore, we would expect that the FDA review process will take some time to complete. And while we're not intending to predict the FDA-specific time line, we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes and we believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. We plan to update you if there are any significant developments. And for now, we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity. We've learned a lot of valuable lessons and gained insights during this journey that we're applying to our ongoing next-generation pump platform programs as well as our quality and risk management systems. Turning to Slide 13. We are making significant progress with our tuck-in M&A strategy. Year-to-date, we've closed five acquisitions and we have a robust funnel of opportunities at various stages. We continue to exercise financial discipline, in addition to ensuring deals meet our strategic and operational criteria. This includes them being accretive to our growth profile, supporting our key innovation themes, advancing our strategic positions, meeting our financial hurdles and creating shareholder value. As part of building a more holistic approach to expanding our inorganic growth funnel, we also expanded our evaluation and selective investment in early-stage strategic opportunities. On Slide 14, we highlight our key innovation themes and with some of our tuck-in acquisitions and R&D products across our three business segments that align to these themes, some of which I've already highlighted. So within this theme of applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and artificial intelligence to improve care processes, I've already discussed our Smart Foley catheter Sensica. We also continue to develop new modules of Kiestra, our total lab automation system. Kiestra as you know can improve standardization, significantly enhance lab efficiencies and staff productivity. Within Medical, our health site platform is designed to continue to support enterprise-wide medication management. We continue to evolve our capabilities with health site diversions, which was originally launched in fiscal 2019 for Pyxis. We have scaled tremendously over the last year in terms of our commercial sites and we have plans to expand into the OR, followed by integration of infusion data and central pharmacy. Within this theme of enabling new care settings, you've seen us acquire Med Bank and GSL Solutions to expand our medication management offering into the faster-growth non-acute settings and strengthen our existing dispensing leadership position. Our PureWick dry dock urine collection system has been helping women with urinary incontinence outside of the acute setting and contributing to the strong growth in our UCC franchise. And I've already talked about how we're excited about the upcoming launch of our BD Veritor at-home COVID-19 test that enables the expansion of testing into everyday settings. Lastly our third theme is improving diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. I already mentioned Pristine and I've talked about in the past our BD Oncology HPV assay, which offers extended genotyping that supports risk stratification. And we look forward to launching this assay on our BD core system in the United States later this year. One other product that we haven't talked a lot about is our BD Libertas subcutaneous drug delivery system for the administration of viscous biologics. Our Pharmaceutical Systems business is excited to offer this option to our biopharmaceutical partners as a combination product. These products not only add value to our customers, patients and health care system but they add to our confidence in a sustainable, durable, mid-single-digit growth profile. Now turning to Slide 15. As I've described so far on this call, we are making substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy, which is about unleashing the growth potential of BD, delivering innovation to our customers, empowering our associates and creating value for our shareholders. And I'm really excited today to announce a bold step in our BD 2025 strategy. Our intention to spin-off our diabetes business to our shareholders which we believe is a value-creating transaction. Our Diabetes Care business generated $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, is a global leader in insulin injection devices. Consistent with our continuing focus on delivering shareholder value, we undergo strategic reviews to identify ways to create value and determine that the strategic priorities of BD have diverged from those of our Diabetes Care business. We believe a spin-off will position both companies for long-term growth and success by allowing both to focus on their respective core markets, innovations and customer outcomes. Each company will be able to more efficiently allocate its resources and capital, best positioning the respective companies for their success and value creation. We see tremendous potential to create value for our Diabetes Care business ahead. And let's turn to slide 16, to dive into some of the benefits in greater detail. We see the spin-off as an operating catalyst for our Diabetes Care business. As an independent public company, NewCo will be able to more effectively allocate its human, operational and financial resources to implement a refined growth strategy that will allow it to focus on innovation, and improving the care of patients living with diabetes. Being a separate entity, will also better enable NewCo to attract and retain talent, align management and employee incentives, and have a stock currency that it can use for future acquisitions. For RemainCo BD, we expect the spin-off to strengthen our mid-single-digit FX-neutral revenue growth. We estimate the uplift to our revenue growth rate to be about 30 basis points. And see this as strengthening our double-digit total return growth profile. The spin-off will allow RemainCo to focus on our R&D tuck-in M&A and customer growth strategies, simplify our overall focus and maintain financial flexibility. Considering all of these benefits, we believe this transaction has the potential to create value for our shareholders, which will be owners of both companies. Slide 17, provides an overview of the relevant transaction details. And I've already covered many of these topics. The spin-off is expected to be implemented by a means of a distribution of 100% of the shares of a newly traded -- publicly traded entity to BD shareholders, and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Over the next several months, we'll be filing our Form 10, which will include the carve-out financial statements. Again, we expect the spin-off to be completed in the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by the Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the SEC. Turning to slide 18, NewCo will be led by an experienced management team. And I am very pleased to share that Dev Kurdikar, who joined us earlier this year, as the Worldwide President of Diabetes Care will be the CEO of NewCo. Dev has a long history, in the medtech sector, most recently serving as the CEO of Cardiac Science. Dev has been engaged with the business now for the last few months and will share some of his preliminary thoughts in a moment. I'm also very happy to announce that Jake Elguicze, the Former Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations of Teleflex, has joined BD and will be the CFO of NewCo upon spin. Jake brings extensive experience, in treasury, financial planning, reporting and analysis and investor relations. We're confident that Dev and Jake are the right team, to lead NewCo as they embark on this journey that we believe will create value for all stakeholders. So with that, I want to turn it over to Dev to provide his perspectives on today's announcement, Dev? Thanks Dev. We see this as a great opportunity for those BD associates that will be part of NewCo and we're happy to have you and Jake on board. Turning to slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives across BD. Over the past quarter, we continued to advance our company-wide ESG initiatives, including our recent commitment to be carbon neutral across direct operations by 2040. We also continue to make progress towards identifying our 2030 goals and we look forward to sharing more details behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. Before turning it over to Chris, I want to say again how proud I am of the organization for the progress we've made in advancing the BD 2025 strategy. We are purposely shifting our focus to growth opportunities. Simplifying the organization to remove complexity as I firmly believe complexity gets in the way of growth and we're empowering our associates with a growth mindset. We are committed to doing the right things, the right way and fulfilling our purpose of advancing the world of health. I also want to reiterate how excited I am for what's ahead for both RemainCo BD and NewCo. BD's Board of Directors and management team believe our plans to spin-off the Diabetes Care business will create value for all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Yeah. On that first one Bob, we'll be clearer on that as we do the carve-out financial statement. So you can expect to see that going forward. But as you know, we don't break it out at that level at the operating basis \u2013 on an ongoing basis. But as we do carve-outs that will be clearer. Too early to say right now as we're still going through the midst of that. Yes. So as you can see this year, we're spending and investing to drive future growth from the Veritor proceeds. And so that will be something that does not reoccur next year so you will see a lift. And clearly, you would get a lift from Alaris coming back because that was a drag on our operating margins as well. And I would also add the \u2013 in terms of FX you see some FX pressure that we pointed out this year. We'll continue to see some of that rolling through our inventory for the remainder of this year. That should turn around next year as well. Yeah. We're not going to give 2022 guidance this early. A lot of that will be impacted as you know by what happens to COVID testing. And we're pulling all the levers we can to make COVID testing more sustainable as we think about the combined COVID and flu assay and we're also \u2013 we're working on the at-home test. So that should have some ability to have sustainability in COVID testing. But clearly, it will come down. And where that goes will have a big impact on operating margins and gross margins in total as you would know. Good morning, Robbie. Just so, Robbie, on the question around Veritor, just as a reminder, we've always used, and emphasized the word, towards the high end, not the high end, which is what you just calculated. So if you -- you're maybe a little bit less per quarter than what you said to get towards the high end of the range, right? But to your point, we're almost -- we ended the first two quarters at almost $1 billion of revenue on Veritor. So you could think, we're on basically roughly two-thirds of the way through that number halfway through the year, which gives us confidence in reiterating that towards the high end of that range. And as you said, it's maybe a little bit less than what you indicated, would be split by quarter there. On the Alaris, we do have a backlog of orders that we would be able to ship initially. And then as we think about upgrades, those are shorter install times than, let's say, Pyxis, so it would be a couple of months typically in that space, from an order to implementation for Alaris. Yes. Good morning, Vijay. Yes. Go ahead, Chris, take that one. And, Vijay, you did ask about the -- this is Tom, about the patch. So that does continue in -- the patch pump. That continues in our pipeline with external development partner, as we've shared in the past. And certainly, as we approach the actual timing of the spin, you can expect that there will be further discussions on the strategy of the diabetes business and updates on that and other products within our R&D pipeline and on Dev and his team's vision for the business post spin. But those discussions as is typical in these situations wouldn't happen until we get closer to the spin. And Vijay as a reminder we've been reaffirming ever since I've been in the role mid-single-digit revenue growth double-digit TSR and reaffirming that this actually strengthens our position on both of those. So the Diabetes Care was growing below the company on revenue and on operating income. Okay. Good morning, Larry. Yes. So it's a great question. As we think about other opportunities in the company that we have whether or not it's across our Interventional segment and just the tremendous technology opportunities that are happening there in our BD Medical segment as well future of medication management and the opportunities in the non-acute space, the opportunity again to apply automation and informatics across both our Interventional and Medical and our Life Science business are significant for us. We see very attractive opportunities in those areas. And also of course diabetes business as we look at it, it has a more unique business profile relative to our other franchises. So, for example, they have very distinct patients, physician and distribution channel dynamics as compared to our other businesses. As you think about our BD Medical, excluding Diabetes, our Interventional and our Life Science franchise they have very significant overlap in call points right? They all call on health care systems. It's where we sell the majority of our Life Science products, our Interventional products and our BD MMS and MDS products into that channel. That's very different than diabetes. And as we think about that digital footprint that we've been building out how we're leveraging data and connectivity connected into electronic medical records across the segments that's also a different dynamic than what we see in the diabetes care business, which is again it's not connecting into EMRs in the same way, it's more directly outbound in the patient. And as you think about future technologies like patch pump or other options they also will require a very different commercial channel than is the -- what's inherent in the rest of the BD businesses be the eye life sciences or the rest of Medical. So we think that absolutely there are tremendous opportunities for BD Diabetes Care business which is why we're excited that spinning them will be -- allow them to unleash that potential not competing with other programs in the company allowing them to attract the best talent, reinvest their profits back into driving their strategy in a very focused way and will allow RemainCo BD to also be more focused in executing our strategy. So that's why we again reiterate why we're so excited about this being a tremendous opportunity for not only the business, but for our shareholders and our associates. That's when pandemic was in it's in its peak. Yes. Yes. So, we obviously view that as a form of -- we think about organic and inorganic innovation opportunities as both fueling that growth profile that we have and that we've defined. I think as we think about just the five that we've done this year, obviously, six last year, there are a number of them that are meaningful within the businesses that we have. We're really excited about the new catheter for example in BDI in their Peripheral Intervention business which is where that will show up. It's going to be a great product for them. It's really a breakthrough technology that's in a market that again is growing much faster than the company average. As we think about the two acquisitions in MMS that get us into the non-acute medication management area. That's an area that's growing much faster than the acute care medication management. As we've made very clear in our strategy helping to enable the shift of care into the non-acute sector is important to us. And we want to have a continue our leadership in the acute but be the leader also in enabling the trend that's happening building up the capabilities in the non-acute sector. And so those two acquisitions I think we'll look back on as being very strategic in enabling that. And both of those markets are growing in the teens. So, again, very positive growth rate there. And there's a couple that we haven't disclosed yet and you can see on the slide 13 that we had shared products like an infection prevention product. We haven't launched a new infection prevention product for a while. Obviously, our ChloraPrep franchise and a great commercial organization that drives that product globally. This will be a nice new addition to their bag and we'll talk about that forthcoming just like we did with Pristine. We had acquired that last year but we didn't announce it until now until we're actually launching it. So we'll do the same there. And the same factor with a new vascular access product that we're excited about that we just closed in the last month or so which we'll talk about very forthcoming as we bring that to market. So a number of different opportunities all very relevant in driving our business strategy. All of those acquisitions are participating in markets and we expect to grow faster than the BD average and again, it's part of our growth strategy. Yes. Richard, we're still very focused on tuck-in M&A. Obviously, for us as a company of our size, tuck-in M&A can be probably in a couple of billion-dollar range in terms of deal size, but we certainly are not looking to do anything on the transformational side of like a CareFusion or Bard-type size. And that's very consistent with the strategy that we've communicated. Could you see larger tuck-in M&A deals than what we've done to date? Yes, but they would still be tuck-in M&A. Sure. I'll turn it over to Chris to share some thoughts on the -- that element that there certainly has been a drag and we've been investing. As we've shared we have a team of over 200 people who have been working on that submission. They'll continue to be engaged in responding to any FDA questions. And obviously, we'll pivot them towards innovation opportunities as we move forward beyond that as well. But maybe just another point as you think about the timing of it, I can give a little bit more color is, if you look back right just factually look back and say over the last few years, how long has the FDA taken to clear pumps. And the date -- the clearance time ranges from 161 days to 412 days. So those are the facts. So call it 5.5 to 14 months. So that's a little bit of the logic. While we're not predicting the FDA time line right now, clearly the timing of approval within FY 2022 will have a meaningful impact in the answer to your question in terms of how we see the recovery and how much that contributes in 2022. And again, as I mentioned before, as we get further in the review process we'll provide updates as we can. But right now we're saying it will be prudent based on again historical clearance timings as I just described. So think about the clearance during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. So Chris, maybe any comments on the drag that it's been... Hey, Matt. Good morning. And there are areas as we look at that maybe Simon \u2013 it's something we monitor very, very closely. We feel very good in terms of where we're \u2013 in all of our categories, particularly on the \u2013 all of our categories overall. But on the procedural side, we feel very good about our share positions and where we're trending there. So maybe Simon to comment what you see from a recovery because it does vary. We do have some areas that are at 100% of prior year today and some procedure areas that just take a little bit longer. Again, I think that's associated with the severity of the condition as it still opened up and it varies on geography as well. Very good. Thanks for the question, Matt Hi, Matthew. Good morning. So we would expect that to be a net good guy. Yes. We will continue of course to ship under medical necessity for those customers that qualify. But once we get the 510(k), which again, will have more clarity on the exact timing of that, which will be meaningful. To answer how much of that will fall in 2022, we certainly expect a full year in 2023. But stay tuned on that but in any situation we would expect it to be a positive. Yes. We have seen no impact. Of course, the customers have very, very broadly stuck with Alaris. Alaris is the market-leading product for a reason. We've talked about the percentage of infusions, particularly in the US that happened with Alaris and it's a tremendous number. And customers \u2013 we do expect the majority of customers to upgrade to the new product as we end up launching that, hopefully in 2022, as we noted is our expectation. So because of that we don't see any impact on Pyxis. Obviously, there is a great value that one gets from having the full BD enterprise medication management suite that allows you to do things like diversion analytics and other parts of our HealthSight platform to use data from not only dispensing but infusion, as well as our software that's in the central pharmacy. And so all of those things remain the case going forward and we think customers will continue to see strong value in that. Good morning, Jason. Yes. We -- so as has been our practice until we get the EUA in hand we don't project a specific launch timings. But we've been very active in development on that for a bit. It's been advancing very well in our pipeline. And so stay tuned as soon as we get an EUA for that product. You and everyone else will be among the first to know on that. And obviously, we are taking actions to prepare for that channel which we recognize is a unique channel versus the other ones and we're taking those actions to prepare for that launch. So we think we'll be well positioned when we do get the EUA and stay tuned. We'll look forward to announcing that. Okay. Thank you, Jason. Okay. Well thank you everyone for the excellent questions. And before we sign off I would be remiss not to wish, Vince Forlenza a wonderful retirement. And I expect that Vince is listening. Vince's last day on the BD Board was last week and I've mentioned in the past that Vince's leadership transformed BD. And I'm also grateful for the time, I got to work alongside him and for his mentorship. So on behalf of everyone at BD I just want to wish Vince all the best. And lastly, on behalf of the Board and the entire executive team I want to thank BD's 70,000 plus associates around the globe. Your efforts and sacrifices have not gone unnoticed. We are making great progress. We're making meaningful impacts for our customers. And most importantly, we are advancing care around the world. I've never been more excited about what lies ahead for us. For those who remain part of BD and for those that will ultimately become part of NewCo these are exciting times. And I hope everyone stays safe and healthy and thank you for listening today."

            "name": "Simon Campion",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Robbie. It's Simon. So let me just add at the bottom here with UCC, a really strong quarter as you see driven by double-digit growth in PureWick and TTM. So, it will continues to be a mid to high single-digit performer for us this quarter. Peripheral, as Tom has mentioned, Peripheral we did see impacts early in the quarter in this space and particularly in the ESKD business and that is -- that should not be a surprise to you based on what you've probably heard from others involved in that space, but a sequential improvement through the end of March and into April and the outlook remained positive there. And then, with Surgery, no great surprise to us. Two factors driving that. Number one, hernia is not an emergent procedure. So, patients have had hernias for several years. So that is typically impacted first when a resurgence happens and they are treated later, when the recovery is initiated. And secondly, the Q2 of last year for us had a particularly high growth in ChloraPrep, I would say, higher than normal. So that's a bit of an offset, as we move into this quarter. But the sustainability of our business, I think, is demonstrated in China, for example, this past quarter. We were very significantly impacted in Q2 last year in China and it has rebounded really strongly in Q2 of this year. So we remain confident in our ability to recover our business as the resurgence abates here. Yes. So obviously, our European business was disproportionately impacted I think in the last quarter. But as Tom alluded to, we do track this every couple of weeks. We've done monthly surveys with customers. And sequentially, as I noted earlier on, it has improved across the two main businesses that are impacted PI and Surgery and some aspects of those businesses or some platforms did strike 100% of pre-COVID levels in March and that continues into April. As I noted earlier, hernia is one of those areas that's severely impacted early and recovers late. So that's a bit of a laggard. But in general, the procedures that are critical to health care are coming back. And not only do we see it in our numbers but the survey data that we gather from physicians and we typically survey about 300 a month, they are indicating that their volumes are rebounding. And obviously, patients that were put on hold are now going to start to come back over the next four to six months as well. So it's \u2013 we're in a reasonable spot."

            "name": "Dev Kurdikar",
            "content": "Thanks Tom, and hello to everyone listening to today's call. I'm incredibly excited to embark on this journey. I see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes. I'm also very humbled, to be leading this amazing organization. The Diabetes Care business has a long history of caring for patients living with the disease, dating back to BD's introduction of the world's first specialized insulin syringe, almost 100 years ago in 1924. Since then, BD has played a leading role in the delivery of insulin, including helping to drive the adoption of insulin pens, which utilize our pen needle technology, as a leading modality for insulin injection. Our Diabetes Care business now reaches more diabetic patients, than any other medical device company in the world today. We manufacture eight billion devices per year and are the global leader in insulin injection devices. As Tom mentioned earlier, the business generated nearly $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020, derived from the sale of insulin injection devices such as, pen needles and insulin syringes as well as other accessories. One factor that attracted me to this opportunity was the global breadth of the business with 48% of the revenues generated outside the United States, including 17% in emerging markets. And why is this important? As you can see on slide 21, diabetes is a growing chronic condition across the globe, with some of the higher prevalence rates expected to be in the emerging market regions. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to grow from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030 and 700 million by 2045. Most of these patients will likely continue to rely on traditional injection devices for their insulin needs. The rapid growth of the disease will likely place a significant burden on healthcare systems around the world, as patients with diabetes are often afflicted with multiple co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetic retinopathy and lower limb complications. While I've only been with the company for a few months now, I can assure you that my passion and vision for NewCo is one of growth. Injection devices like pen needle and syringes are likely to remain a key part of their treatment paradigm for people with diabetes on a global basis for the foreseeable future. We will look to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on these demographic trends. However, we'll also look to invest in novel insulin delivery technologies, including our internal type 2 patch technologies. We also plan to supplement our internal R&D product development efforts more broadly and accelerate our growth profile through strategic M&A to broaden our product offerings and enter adjacencies on new growth categories. Let me end by saying how excited and humbled I am to have this opportunity to lead NewCo. I am confident that our team will work tirelessly to advance care for our patients while building shareholder value. With that I'll turn it over back to Tom."

            "content": "Thanks Tom. And before I turn to the results, let me also share my enthusiasm for the spin-off of our Diabetes Care business. I see the transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our patients. I'm confident that we have the right leadership to navigate NewCo on this exciting journey ahead. Now let me turn to the second quarter financial results. Slide 27 summarizes our high-level revenue performance. Our revenues came in just over $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with our results. Our core segment results excluding COVID-19 diagnostic testings were ahead of our expectations across all segments. Now turning to slide 28. Our medical segment delivered 4.7% FX-neutral revenue growth led by our market leading BD Pharmaceutical Solutions Systems business, which continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. We are proceeding with our capacity expansion to support the future growth of this business unit. MDS grew a solid 8.1%, which included $43 million from COVID-19 vaccination injection device revenues. We also benefited from higher patient acuity and higher utilization internationally particularly in China where we anniversaried the impact of COVID-19. Now turning to slide 29. Our Life Science segment delivered revenue growth of nearly 38% on an FX neutral basis. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues totaled $480 million and are included in our Integrated Diagnostics Solutions business. While BD Veritor ASPs were as expected in the low to mid-teens, the market's overall demand for symptomatic COVID diagnostic testing was lower. Looking at our IDS business excluding COVID testing, our routine diagnostic testing has not yet fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. There was virtually no traditional flu this year, so we did not have our usual flu test revenues and this impacted our IDS growth rate by 540 basis points and our BD Life Sciences growth rate by 410 basis points. The impact to our overall BD growth rate was 110 basis points. Our Biosciences business unit delivered strong growth of over 12% as research lab activity has recovered nicely. We are seeing strong demand for research instruments and reagents as well as from biopharmaceutical companies for vaccine research and development. As shown on slide 30, the BD Interventional segment was flat this quarter, which was better than expected given the COVID-19 resurgences. The performance in surgery and PI reflected the early impact from the COVID resurgence. However, we did see recovery in elective procedures as the quarter progressed and this trend has continued into April. Our urology and critical care franchise continues to deliver solid growth led by our Purewick and targeted temperature management product lines. Turning to our results by geographic regions on slide 31. In the United States, revenues were up 1.9%. As we had discussed on our February earnings call, we did see some early impact from COVID-19 resurgence, which waned as the quarter progressed and we exited March with improved momentum and this continued in April.  International revenues were up 25.7% on a currency-neutral basis as we begin to anniversary the initial impact of COVID-19, particularly in China where our revenues were up 62%. We also benefited from our COVID-19 responses, our diagnostic testing and vaccine injection delivery device revenues.  Now turning to the P&L on slide 32. As expected our gross margin was sequentially lower as compared to our first quarter. Our gross margin was 53.8% driven mostly by the lower COVID diagnostic testing revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the gross margin included a 70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange and 70 basis points from reinvestment initiatives. Favorable impacts from our continuous improvement initiatives were offset by product quality-related expenses.  Our SSG&A spending rose 9% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, including a 380 basis point impact from deferred compensation, which as you know is fully offset in other income expense. The remaining increase in SSG&A is primarily related to higher shipping costs and investment spending as part of our BD Veritor profit reinvestments.  Our R&D spending ramped sequentially as planned as we reinvested some of the BD Veritor profits behind new pipeline innovations. R&D increased 18.7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis to $295 million, representing 6% of our revenues.  Our operating income grew 14.3% on a year-over-year reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Our operating margin was 24.5%, up 20 basis points on an FX-neutral basis. Deferred compensation was an 80 basis point headwind.  Our interest and other expenses totaled $111 million versus $170 million in the year ago period. The reduction of interest other net on a year-over-year basis, primarily reflects a decrease in deferred compensation offsetting increases in SSG&A as previously mentioned. It also reflects reduced interest expense due to debt repayment and refinancing activities and lower interest rates.  Our tax rate was 12% lower than expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. Our adjusted EPS increased 25.1% over the prior year to $3.19 on a reported basis and were up 22.7% on an FX-neutral basis. The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was $293.6 million.  Now turning to slide 33, I'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation priorities, but first I want to update you on the great progress we made with our cash flows and balance sheet on a year-to-date basis. For the first half of the year, our cash flows from operations have more than doubled growing from $1.2 billion to $2.8 billion, driven by the improvement in our net income as well as working capital. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio was 2.4 times, a full turn lower than a year ago.  Going forward our capital allocation strategy will be more balanced than it had been in the past as we were paying down our debt. Now more of our cash can be deployed to support our growth strategy, tuck-in M&A, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases.  As a reminder under the existing share repurchase authorization plan, we have just under 7.9 million shares or roughly $2 billion remaining. Also note that we would expect BD's dividend to be unaffected by the diabetes spin-off and therefore would increase BD's payout ratio.  Next I want to address our fiscal 2021 guidance and provide some general commentary on our overall outlook, which you can see on slide 34. From a reporting perspective, we will continue to report our diabetes business with our BD results until the spin-off of the diabetes business is complete.  We're very pleased with the results for the quarter how we are building momentum in our core, advancing our pipeline and achieving critical milestones. We are also pleased with the early progress we see from BD Veritor profit reinvestments. We believe these projects should begin to provide incremental growth beginning in late 2022.  We are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 financial guidance ranges. We continue to expect reported revenue growth of 12% to 14% for the full year 2021. This reflects FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%. BD Veritor revenues towards the higher end of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range and foreign currency adding approximately 200 basis points. We also continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which represents growth of 25% to 26% year-over-year.  Now we wanted to give you some color as you consider your models for the back half of the year. We continue to reinvest some of the Veritor profits to fund projects in line with our BD 2025 strategic pillars of growth simplify and power. Our investments continue to put temporary pressure on both our gross and operating margins in 2021. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect our operating margins in the second half of the year to be in the low 20s, reflecting our reinvestment initiatives as well as higher raw material costs. As a reminder, we expect the reinvestment pressures that you're seeing on our margins to lift next year. As you've seen in the past from time to time there can be some volatility in our tax rate. We now expect our FY 2021 tax rate to be slightly lower than FY 2020's tax rate. This helps to offset some gross margin pressure from the lower ASPs from Veritor as pricing is now approaching compared to our flu test price a bit faster than we originally anticipated. Regarding 2022 given the momentum we are seeing our progress with our R&D pipeline the reinvestments of our BD Veritor proceeds and our tuck-in acquisition strategy we have increased confidence in our core outlook. In fiscal 2022, excluding COVID-19 testing and Alaris 510(k) clearance, we expect our revenues to grow solidly in the mid-single digits. As you heard Tom mention, while we're not intending to predict the FDA's time line we recognize the desire to have some input for modeling purposes. We believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' 510(k) clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal 2022. We believe it would also be prudent to model both our revenues and our margins gradually ramping as we scale our selling and manufacturing efforts. In conclusion, we are really pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum across our businesses. We are excited about our plans to spin-off of the diabetes business and see this as an important opportunity to create value for our shareholders. With that, Tom, Alberto, Simon, Dave and I are happy to take any questions you have. Operator, please open up the line for Q&A. I would just add two comments. In terms of Interventional it actually exceeded our expectations in the quarter, because we had seen January and the resurgence from COVID and we had seen that going into the February call. And that did turn around in March and happy to see it turn around in April. But I'd also take a step back in terms of the core momentum and point to the fact that we see that improving. It's helping us with the outlook for the remainder of this year. And I would also point to the fact that we showed that confidence in what we said about 2022 by moving the core guidance for 2022 from low single to mid digits to solid mid-single digits. And that's reflective of the momentum across the business that we see as sustainable. Good morning. Yes. Let me take the first one. So you're absolutely right. We put in that, there would be growth of 30 basis points. And just think of that as a $1 billion or so of revenue, which has been relatively flattish compared to the rest of the $17 billion growing that mid-single digits. If you do that math, you can see the drag that that has of 30 basis points. And I would remind you that, our guidance is a recurring mid-single-digit kind of growth rate and so that 30 basis points gives us greater confidence in the ability to achieve that on an ongoing regular sustainable basis. So that's a positive. We haven't addressed the growth rate of spinco going forward. You heard Dev say that his emphasis is on growth. And we think that, being a separate public company, it unleashes that growth potential, because right now spinco would be fighting or diabetes care within BD is fighting for investment against other items that we are -- feel more strategic. So as a separate company, it can invest, whether that is internally more investment in R&D or through M&A, it can do that. So more to come on the growth profile of spinco as a separate entity, but that's kind of directionally the way to think about it. Yes. So as we said this strengthens -- the spin actually strengthens and gives us more confidence in both the top-line and the bottom-line. And that will be clear as we talk about the operating margins as we said from the SpinCo. So this gives us more confidence in that and so it supports that effort. You did mention Vijay that the stranded cost there would be some stranded costs in any transaction like this. We feel good about the fact that we can address those stranded costs. And obviously, we'll have a couple of years of TSA agreements that will mitigate those for a couple of years. So we're not concerned about stranded costs having an impact. Sure. So, number one is that the core is actually accelerating and so the growth rate in the core will be ramping and we're now saying we'll end the year at mid-single digits in the core. So, a couple of things going on as we think about and contemplate the remainder of 2021. So, number one that core momentum is increasing. We did mention that Veritor is still within that towards the high end of that 1% to 1.5% range. But it has moderated slightly as volumes have come down a bit from the last time we gave guidance. And so that offsets that a little bit. And when you're looking at the pure dollars it's that Veritor testing and the COVID testing that's impacting the pure dollars. So, the bottom-line is -- the good news is the momentum is in the core moderating slightly on COVID testing as we look out the second half of the year. You put all those together and we're right where we said we would be in terms of both the topline and the bottom-line. On the bottom-line, we're also seeing a little bit of an impact on the profitability of Veritor as the prices begin to move more rapidly towards the typical flu pricing. And so that's having an impact and that's being offset in the second half of the year. So, we're still within the guidance range on the top and the bottom. On a year-on-year basis. Last year there's a very large -- yes. Yeah. Just to give a little bit on the revenues the -- in last year, we had medical necessity revenues of about $130 million or thereabouts. And don't forget, we had some non-medical necessity earlier in the year. So you're thinking about $200 million of revenues last year. The run rate prior to that was about $450 million thereabouts. So you could see that step down. And then this year, we see less medical necessity a little bit over $60 million or so in the first half of the year. We see that tailing off in the second half of the year. So that gives you some things to work with to show that there is certainly a drag on growth rate from the step down offset by some of the medical necessity revenues, but certainly a step down in both 2020 and 2021. As you think about next year, what we were giving you a sense of is that we think it's prudent to model that as during the second half of the year. It could happen sooner, we'll work to try to make it happen sooner, but it's prudent to think about it in the second half of the year. And we did point to the fact that there is some ramping that will happen. The good news is that we'll get the full year benefit of that coming back to us in FY 2023 regardless. But we do expect to see some of that ramping in the second half of the year. So we did give some insights into the impact of that spending. We did point to a lot of folks don't realize that some of that actually hits our gross margin and so we pointed to the fact that there was a 70 basis point hit to the gross margin number within Q2. We -- the way to think about that spending in the $200-plus million is that it is more ratable. We do see some -- you would expect some of that to ramp a bit. And so we're not being precise about exactly how much was in each quarter. But it is -- there's more to come. And so it is putting pressure on the margins which is why we're saying that the guidance for the second half is what it is as we expected it would be. So it is important to keep in mind that that investment that we're making does drive future growth, it's not something that will impact margins going forward. It's not going to repeat. And it is as a result suppressing both gross margin and operating margins this year. Sure. So we have seen some improvement in utilization in March for example and that continue in April. But as we said, we don't expect that to get back to the 100% level. It does get up into the 90s by the back end of the year. We're more in the 80s, high 80s now. So we expect that to start creeping back but not completely get back in the second half of the year. Yes, a net good guy. So when we're doing that we're saying specifically excluding the COVID testing, which will get more clarity on as we go forward. And excluding the come back of the 510(k) from Alaris. So that would be incremental to that mid-single-digit core growth. Yes. So no that's -- those are decisions that will come as we move forward and we'll provide more details on that closer to the spin date. We do expect that the capital structure along with the existing cash profitability will provide them the flexibility to pursue inorganic growth opportunities. So we want to make sure that they have that kind of flexibility and then it will be part of what goes into the equation in terms of how much debt they'll carry."

            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "Yes. I can start with maybe just some comments on Medical, and then turn it to Simon on Interventional. So certainly, in Medical you see a couple of things happening. One is we see continued durable growth you saw last year in Pharmaceutical Systems. You saw it again in the quarter that they were in 8% plus I think last year growth, and we see that durably higher than average company growth is my intention there. And you saw us obviously communicate I think, it was last quarter or the quarter before, over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of incremental investment, capital investment in that business to support the long-term growth outlook. So that's number one. We also reaffirm that we expect -- we are in discussions and we have collaborations going on with several pharma companies about putting COVID vaccines in prefilled syringes. So again, another opportunity as we think about that business long-term. In MDS, we also commented that I remember, a year ago or less than a year ago, we were talking about that we could do up to one billion syringes to help in the COVID vaccination. We now -- today announced, we have orders -- commitments in hand for 1.7 billion syringes that spans well into FY 2022. And so we see, while we were wondering was there going to be a cliff of syringes into 2022, we see that demand in our MDS business as being durable into 2022. And certainly, as we think about potential even further demand, from things like booster shots, that would just make that demand even more durable. Overall, that business continues to do well in terms of taking share in the catheter space as well as a series of new innovations. They obviously had had some benefits from higher acuity patients in the ICU, which are maybe using products like midlines or PICCs, which have higher ASPs than peripheral catheters for shorter-time stays, but there's strong durable trends there I think in MDS. And obviously MMS, we look forward with the submission of the 510(k) to have bigger growth opportunities as we look ahead to 2022. I think I'll turn it over to Simon on BDI. But I would say what you saw is that the impact from the pandemic was very minimal in the first two months of the quarter last year for BDI. And so, I think you see just that comparable happening given our product mix. And then, we did see strong trajectory and uptake in March and we saw that continue into April. Simon."

It will be available for replay through February 11, 2021, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (855) 859-2056 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 6993448. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today\u2019s call is Ms. Kristen Stewart, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms. Stewart, you may begin.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome to BD\u2019s review of our first fiscal quarter results. Joining me today, we have Tom Polen, Chief Executive Officer and President; Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will have our three segment presidents joining us as well: Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Dave Hickey , President of the Life Sciences segment; and Simon Campion, President of the Interventional segment. A few logistics before we get into the call. This call is being made available via webcast at bd.com, where you can also find the accompanying slides for today\u2019s call. During the call, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be found in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. In particular, there continues to be significant uncertainties about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This commentary we are providing today includes our best estimate based upon the information that we currently have. We have made certain assumptions in how we are managing our business, but that could change as we move forward. business, but that could change as we move forward. We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. The reconciliations to GAAP measures that include the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. These are also available on the bd.com website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus fiscal 2020. When we discuss revenue percent changes, they are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. With all that said, it is my pleasure to turn it over to BD\u2019s CEO and President, Tom Polen. Tom.\nThomas Polen: Thank you, Kristen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our Q1 results, which were ahead of our expectations, reflecting the tremendous efforts and execution of BD\u2019s 70,000 associates. The essential role of our products and solutions and healthcare and a greater resiliency of the health care system in treating both COVID and non-COVID patients. While our fiscal year has just started, I\u2019m proud of the team for the momentum we are building and their dedication to our purpose of advancing the world of health. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis or 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis, with 20.3 percentage points of growth coming from our COVID-19 diagnostic revenues. While we did see some benefits from timing in the quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of the base business, which was up 4% against the backdrop of COVID resurgences around the world. We are seeing the early benefits of some of the actions we have taken to drive our base performance. Our adjusted EPS were $4.55 or up 72% versus the prior year. This was also well above our expectations as a result of three factors. First, our revenues came in above our plan, driven by higher acuity, driving increased demand, greater resiliency and procedural volumes and exceptional execution in COVID diagnostics. Second, we benefited from favorable product mix, like Veritor, but also from our higher acuity products. Third, our investment spending, such as in R&D, was lighter and earlier in ramping. So as you can see, we started this year with strong momentum, and that is despite the COVID resurgence. We did start to see some impact of the resurgence on our more elective procedure related businesses late in December, and that continued into January. However, we are feeling more confident in the resiliency of our base business relative to what we saw early on in the pandemic. While the health care markets continue to be dynamic with COVID-19, and there are a number of moving parts, the momentum within BD and our conviction in our strategy lead us to raise our financial guidance for fiscal 2021. Our focus is not only on fulfilling our near-term commitments, but also on advancing our strategy and creating value for our shareholders over the longer term. And I\u2019m feeling even greater confidence with the progress the BD team is making in advancing the BD 2025 Grow, Simplify and Empower initiatives and our ability to create substantial shareholder value. Today, I want to focus my remarks on three key topics, and then I will turn it over to Chris, who will provide additional remarks on our quarter\u2019s performance and comment on our outlook, then we will take your questions. So let\u2019s jump right in. First, let me start with the Alaris remediation and our overall quality and compliance initiatives. Alaris remediation has and continues to be my number one priority, and the team is making strong progress. Our focus remains on submitting a comprehensive 510(k) filing for the Alaris system, and we remain on-track to submit it in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. We also continue to make progress on executing our holistic Inspire Quality initiatives throughout the organization. Second, as you know, we have a very strong focus on growth and ensuring a durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile, so let me share some of the exciting highlights in our pipeline and other growth initiatives. We continue to increase our investments and strengthen our pipeline across three innovation themes that leverage our core strengths. First, we are applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and AI to improve care processes. Second, we are enabling new care settings to enhance patient experience and lower costs. This includes investing in products designed for use in the home markets and in sales channels to support these patients. And third, we are investing to improve diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease.  So in line with these innovation and investment priorities, in Q1, we acquired the medical assets of CUBEX, which expands our medication management offering by combining a cloud-based, easy-to-deploy analytics platform with a smart tabletop dispensing device to create solutions for the fast growing non-acute care market. This extends our medication management solution from the hospital into the long-term care surgery centers and other non-acute locations. Another smart device we plan on launching this quarter is the Sensica automated urine output system, which leverages BD\u2019s leading position in acute urology, along with BD\u2019s broad EMR interoperability capabilities and installed base. Also within BD Interventional, the BD PureWick urine collection system and catheter continues to be a significant driver of growth for our urology and critical care business. PureWick is a female external urinary catheter and urine collection system that we sell into the acute care and long-term care settings, but we are now actively extending that directly to patients with our new PureWick dry dock system for the home. And this launch is exceeding our expectations. And in fact, PureWick revenues now exceeds Lutonix. An exciting launch later this year, designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, is the U.S. launch of our new BD COR with our BD Onclarity HPV assay with extended genotyping. With BD COR, BD is going to enter the high throughput molecular testing market with a very unique, fully automated sample-to-answer platform in a highly differentiated assay with unique claims that can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management. The system has been CE-Marked and has been very well received by our customers during our launch in Europe. These are just a few of the many products in our pipeline, and you can find further details on our new innovations in the supplemental earnings presentation posted to our website. As we have previously shared, we are investing a portion of our Veritor profits to advance our BD 2025 strategy. We expanded the size of the BD Innovation and Growth Fund, and additional innovation projects are being initiated on a rolling basis. We are investing to accelerate our simplification initiatives, including recode and enhancing our quality and compliance programs. We are also increasing funding in our BD University to support advanced employee education and leadership development as part of our strategy. As we always do with our spending, we are taking a disciplined approach, and the timing of the spending was lighter in Q1, and we expect it to step up in Q2 and remain higher for the balance of the fiscal year. As we have mentioned before, we continue to actively evaluate tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our growth strategy. And we executed on three strategic tuck-in transactions so far this year, including CUBEX\u2019s medical assets that I mentioned earlier. We continue to apply a disciplined financial and strategic evaluation process to these transactions and have a robust funnel up. Lastly, I would like to update you on our COVID diagnostics outlook and specifically Veritor. Antigen testing continues to become more widely used in both traditional and nontraditional settings. We have been highly successful with our BD Veritor Plus COVID-19 launch. Veritor has been well received for the ease of use, performance and automated digital data and informatics capabilities that are provided with our handheld platform. We have nearly tripled our active reader base since the pandemic and now have more than 70,000 BD Veritor analyzers globally, which we intend to leverage in the future with planned non-COVID menu expansion, which we have already begun investing behind. As previously shared, we continue to make good progress on advancing new COVID diagnostics in our pipeline, including combination flu A/B and COVID-19 assays on both BD MAX and Veritor. We also continue to explore home testing on BD Veritor. It has been our practice we will provide updates to these programs upon launch. Turning to the quarter\u2019s performance. Our Q1 COVID-19 diagnostics revenues were higher than we expected at $867 million, which included better than expected BD Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen test revenues of $688 million and higher BD MAX COVID assays and collection swabs and transport devices. The higher than expected Veritor revenues were the result of our ability to scale our manufacturing faster, which is a testament to our manufacturing excellence, as well as realizing higher pricing than we anticipated. However, since we have been saying since last fall, we do expect pricing to move lower as capacity came online, and this is what is playing out. We recently lowered our pricing to allow the broadest patient access to our best-in-class BD Veritor Plus System. We believe this price adjustment is in the best interest of our customers and patients around the world as we have now ramped our manufacturing capacity, and there are emerging mutations that are making it more transmissible. We also believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders as we believe this move allows us to maintain a leadership position in the point-of-care market. With respect to our fiscal 2021 Veritor revenue guidance, as we have been discussing, there continues to be many variables at play besides the evolving pricing environment, including the rollout and adoption of vaccines and the circulation of new COVID variants. It is also difficult to pinpoint when the market supply for antigen tests will exceed market demand. For modeling purposes, we would suggest using an ASP in the low to mid-teens. Given all this, we expect Veritor revenues to be toward the high end of our previous range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect Veritor revenues to be more weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. And given the evolving pricing and capacity environment, we would expect our fiscal Q2 revenues to be lower than our just reported Q1 results. Before turning it over to Chris to review the financials, I want to close with a few thoughts. While we were very pleased with the performance of Veritor and other COVID diagnostic revenues in the quarter, what excites us more was the improving momentum and resiliency of the base business. While we saw some headwinds in our procedure based businesses from the resurgence late in December and that continued into January, the impact was much more limited than at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, given the momentum in our base business, the investments we are making in our BD 2025 strategy, we believe we are positioned to emerge strong. We remain on-track to submit our Alaris 510(k) filing in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3, and we are making great progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy. And I\u2019m particularly pleased with the investment programs we have identified and initiated. These investments allow us to further fulfill our purpose of advancing the world of health, bringing new innovations to patients and expand access. Increased spending will be more evident in our P&L later in this fiscal year, but we believe these initiatives will translate into revenue accretion beginning in late FY 2022 and beyond. The investments we are making are also towards simplification initiatives, which reduce complexities, drive cost efficiencies, enhance our quality programs and improve cash flows. This quarter, we made several advancements on this front, including inventory reductions that we absorbed in our gross margin in the quarter that helped us strengthen our cash flows. Our ReCoDe efforts are on-track to achieve our targeted $300 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024. We are also advancing our sustainability initiatives because we view sustainability as a strategic imperative. And we recently announced the first of our 2030 and beyond goals, our climate change targets. We are committed to reducing Scope one and two greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 and to be carbon-neutral across direct operations by 2040. The science based target is aligned with the 1.5-degree C global emissions reduction pathway. And we look forward to sharing more detail behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. And finally, I\u2019m very proud of the organization for being named for four consecutive years to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality list and for the second straight year to the Gender Quality Index. Inclusion and diversity is an important focus for BD as we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent as well as benefit from diversity of background and thought. I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A portion of this call, and I will turn it over to Chris now.\nChristopher Reidy: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3billion, in line with our January 12 pre-announcement. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis and 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis. COVID-19 diagnostic revenues accounted for 20.3 percentage points of growth. The better than expected performance came from three areas: first, our base business performed better than expected. This was a result of stronger execution from our associates, greater resiliency and procedure volumes as health care facilities manage both COVID and non-COVID patients, and higher acuity resulted in both favorable product mix and increased demand for several product lines. Keep in mind, though, that some of our business segments are still operating below pre-COVID volume levels. Second, our COVID diagnostic revenues were higher than expected. This included not only Veritor revenues but also MAX and swab and transport revenues. Lastly, we estimated about $100 million in revenues were attributable to stocking and timing. As COVID-19 surges were occurring, we observed some of our customers moving to more of a just-in-case level of inventory and maintaining higher levels of our critical need products on hand. We also saw some of our U.K. customers buying more ahead of Brexit. The $100 million includes higher than expected revenues in our MMS Infusion Systems business due to COVID-19. BD Medical revenues totaled nearly $2.3 billion and grew 6.9% on an FX-neutral basis. Our outperformance was primarily in Medication Delivery Solutions as well as in Medication Management Solutions. MDS revenues were up 5.6%, while hospital utilization remains below pre-COVID levels and has been an ongoing headwind, we benefited from the acuity of care associated with the treatment of COVID patients. We saw increased demand for Pyxis vascular prep and maintenance. As I mentioned, we believe stocking of critical need products helped the quarter. Finally, as expected, there was $37 million in revenues associated with COVID vaccination syringes and needles. Now turning to our MMS business. Revenues grew 8.4%, with growth in both Medication Dispensing and Infusion Systems. In dispensing, we had strong growth internationally and once again exited the quarter with strong committed contracts in the U.S. in Infusion Systems, we continue to support U.S. customers\u2019 response during the pandemic on the medical necessity and experienced another quarter of strong demand in Europe. In Diabetes Care, revenue growth of 5.4% was above our expectations, reflecting distributor inventory stocking in addition to an easy comparison to last year. We still view this business to be more of a flattish business on a normalized basis. Pharm systems sales remained strong, growing 9.5%, driven by ongoing demand for our market leading prefilled syringe portfolio. BD Life Science revenues totaled nearly $2 billion and were up 74.1% on an FX-neutral basis. As I mentioned previously, COVID diagnostic revenues were $867 million in the quarter. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, BD Life Sciences revenues were down 2.4%, which was better than we expected. Integrated Diagnostic Solution revenues increased by 106% due to COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues. Excluding these COVID diagnostic testing revenues, IDS revenues were down just 1.2%. There were several puts and takes in the base business. We saw a stronger than expected performance in our specimen management, blood culture and women\u2019s health and cancer product lines. We also saw some element of distributor stocking that is critical to health care testing. However, while we have seen improvements, routine diagnostic testing activities are not fully back to pre COVID-19 levels and a significantly lighter flu season negatively impacted the base revenue growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now turning to Biosciences. Revenue declined by 5.2% due to a difficult comparison as a result of prior year licensing revenue. In addition, clinical and research activities are not yet fully back to pre COVID-19 levels. Overall, operational performance in Biosciences was better than expected. BD interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, with all business units posting growth. We observed that elective procedures, particularly those conducted in an outpatient setting, had greater resiliency in Q1 compare d to the initial wave of COVID. This was likely driven by processes and care settings that enable elective procedures to continue despite the resurgence and a greater willingness on the part of patients to attend to their scheduled elective procedures. Surgery sales were up 1.3% as strong sales growth in our Infection Prevention business was offset by the ongoing headwinds related to lower procedures due to the pandemic. Peripheral Intervention sales were up 5.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance across our peripheral arterial disease platforms. Urology and Critical Care turned in another quarter of strong growth, with revenues up 8%. PureWick continues to fuel the growth in our acute urology franchise while our new connected Arctic Sun System is driving double-digit growth in our targeted temperature management business. This is another example of BD leveraging our digital capabilities and broad EMR interoperability footprint to bring new innovations to market. Now turning to the P&L. We were really pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margins were 58.2%, which expanded 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. On an FX-neutral basis, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points, which was primarily driven by COVID diagnostics and higher-acuity products. While SSG&A and R&D spending were both higher on a year-over-year basis, the level of spending was lower than we anticipated, particularly R&D, reflecting mainly timing. Operating margins were 31.6%, up 830 basis points on an FX-neutral basis, which was driven by higher gross margins and reduced SG&A and R&D spending. Net interest expense was $118 million, down slightly on a sequential basis. Other income was $30 million versus $27 million a year ago, and the adjusted tax rate came in at 14.6%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted non-GAAP EPS were $4.55. In fiscal Q1, the preferred shares are dilutive. Therefore, in calculating the adjusted non-GAAP EPS, preferred dividends amount of $23 million was excluded from the numerator, while the diluted share count would be adjusted to include the dilutive impact of the convertible preferred shares and would be 299.1 million. As we have been discussing, our BD 2025 strategy includes a focus on driving cash flow, and we were really pleased with the continued progress of these initiatives and our cash flow performance. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $1.3 billion in free cash flows. We have also been focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As we previously communicated, we paid down $265 million of debt in the first fiscal quarter. Our net leverage ratio declined to 2.5 times as of December 31, 2020, from 3.0 times at the end of September 2020. A few weeks ago, Moody\u2019s upgraded our credit to an investment grade rating, and we are committed to maintaining a full investment grade credit rating across the major credit rating agencies. We believe we are approaching a turning point in our capital allocation. In the past, a significant amount of our cash was dedicated to repaying the debt. But looking ahead, we expect to have greater flexibility to refocus our cash deployment on growth opportunities, including tuck-in M&A and other capital deployment options. Next, I want to address fiscal 2021 guidance. While we observed greater resiliency in Q1 as it relates to procedure volumes, we still view COVID-19 resurgences to be a significant risk factor to our forward outlook as it could impact general health care utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. In the latter weeks of December, as the resurgence has picked up, we started to see pressure on some of our procedure based products. This trend continued into January. We have updated our guidance to incorporate some impact from the resurgence into our forecast for fiscal Q2, and we continue to monitor the trends. Our guidance continues to assume no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Now given the strength of our Q1 performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are comfortable forecasting FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% compared to our prior range of high single to low double-digits. This would include our assumption of Veritor revenues being towards the high end of our original guidance range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 200 basis points to revenue growth versus our prior year guidance of about 100 basis points. We expect our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which is above our prior guidance range of $12.40 to $12.60, a raise of $0.30 at the midpoint of the range. So for these reasons, while we are extremely pleased with our strong execution in fiscal Q1, we want to caution against extrapolating our fiscal Q1 revenue, margin and EPS performance going forward. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, we thought it might be helpful to provide some context on this quarter\u2019s strength as you contemplate phasing for the rest of the year. Our Q1 revenues, operating margins and adjusted EPS are likely to be the highest absolute levels for the year due to two factors: Veritor pricing and the ramp of our planned investment spending. In addition, the stocking of $100 million will unwind in the remainder of the year. As Tom mentioned, we expect Veritor revenues in fiscal Q2 to be lower than Q1. As we have discussed in the past, we expected our COVID test pricing to decline, and this is playing out. We expect Veritor to be well positioned for broad access as we look ahead. Regarding our operating margins, our fiscal Q1 EPS benefited from the higher Veritor revenues and margin profile as well as the timing of investment spending. We expect investment spending, particularly in R&D, to be meaningfully stepped up in Q2. The combination of these two factors will result in our operating margins moving into the low to mid-20s in our fiscal Q2. In the second half of the year, given our expectations for lower Veritor revenues and for investment spending to continue to ramp at a similar rate to fiscal Q2, we would expect operating margins in the low 20s. We are also seeing some impact from the resurgence in January. And like many others, we are also continuing to see pressure from higher shipping costs as well as some other headwinds. However, due to the strength of our Q1 results, we are able to offset these headwinds and raise our full year EPS guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Christian, who will help moderate our Q&A.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks so much, everybody. And with that, I\u2019m going to open it up to the operator, Stephanie. Stephanie, could you please read the instruction?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Well good morning and thank you for taking the question and congrats on a nice start to the year. Just two for me, team. So first, just earnings reconciliation, Chris, obviously, beat by more than $1.50, raised by $0.30. And I know you gave some parameters there. But we had pricing reductions in our model. We had 20% reinvestment of that upside in the model, even when you make those kind of adjustments as well as stocking, it is still a little hard to reconcile the upside in the quarter relative to the guide. So I appreciate it is a less visible environment. But is there anything else? Is that investment going higher or anything else we may not be thinking about that would explain why we are not getting this sort of that pull-through in the second, third quarter? Because I think that is going to be the key question this morning of the call.\nChristopher Reidy: Sure, David. Thanks for the question. And I would say, first of all, it is early in the year, obviously. So we are raising - but some of the factors that you mentioned we do see playing out in the remainder of the year. So we had a few things going on. Obviously, we mentioned that Veritor, we would expect that revenue to come down in the remainder of the year and moderate, as we talked about. We also had timing in the base business that we would expect to moderate. And to your point, we do expect the investment spending both in the Veritor reinvestment program that we have discussed as well as R&D and quality to ramp. So we started those programs in Q1. We watch that spending with some prudence as we looked at the pandemic playing out. And so we got started, but the ramp really comes in the second, third and fourth quarter. And so when you put all of that into context, you also have to take into consideration a little bit of impact from the resurgence that we saw that we mentioned we have playing out in Q2. So with all of those factors coming into play, we felt that it was prudent to think about the guidance that we gave as appropriate at this point.\nThomas Polen: Dave, this is Tom. Thanks for the comment. Just to reiterate what Chris mentioned, that other topic is that we still are in the middle of a pandemic. We want to be prudent, right. We did see some increases on impacts in procedure volumes in this late December and throughout January. It was certainly less than what we had seen earlier in the pandemic. But there are new strains underway, et cetera. And when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said it excluded, right, the impact of a resurgence. Well, there has been a resurgence. And we have been navigating that very well and actually are raising our outlook in the middle of a resurgence. So we will continue to evaluate as things go forward, but we are certainly pleased with how we started the year.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. So the state of factors you have mentioned, but we are not missing anything, it doesn\u2019t sound like. Okay. The second question for you, maybe Tom, more strategic. This is obviously going to be very good year. We will see significant upside. The balance sheet is obviously in dramatically better shape now than it was a year ago. As you think about 2022, Tom, how are you thinking about the durability of COVID testing? I know it is a challenging question. And then the ability to sort of manage through what is likely going to be sort of a volatile or void driven earnings period as you head into 2022? How are you thinking about sort of 2022 and beyond COVID-wise and sort of managing the earnings process? Thanks so much.\nThomas Polen: Yes, I will start on that, and then I will turn it to Chris as well to share some comments. Let me maybe focus on specifically COVID testing, and then Chris can make some broader comments on the broader business. And we have shared, by the way, in the past, we still remain very confident and expect our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing, and Alaris pump revenues to grow in those mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis for 2022, and that remains our aim and our expectation. In terms of COVID testing as we go into 2022, certainly, as I had shared before, as we got into COVID rapid testing in last July, obviously, we didn\u2019t have a high expectation that there would be much testing in 2022. And as kind of each quarter has passed since that launch, in July, we have said we are feeling more confident there is going to be some level of testing in FY 2022 and that certainly remains the case. I think one of the ways to think about, as our capacity has gone up in the space, as we recognize the new strains coming in the market, as antigen testing continues to increase in its receptivity and people understand now the value in increasing ways of getting a test result in 15 minutes, you saw us take some actions this quarter to get pricing in that low to mid-teen level, which we think will be more - actually position us well to, as I said, to maintain a leadership position for whatever market continues to evolve going into FY 2022, right. That is part of the thinking. Where the actual market ends up in 2022? I don\u2019t know at this point in time. I think there definitely should be some level of testing. And our aim is to make sure that we are positioned to be a leader in however that testing evolves. And other things that we are investing in as well, be it our combination assay, which is progressing well in our pipeline, the flu COVID assay for our exploration of home testing are all aimed with that thought in mind as well. So maybe, Chris, just maybe some broader comments on FY 2022.\nChristopher Reidy: So yes, obviously, we are not going to go through 2022 with any level of precision, but I think it is important to give some high-level comments on it. And as Tom mentioned, the level of COVID testing is a variable that will have a big impact on 2022. We do see the sustainability of testing, but at what level, it is really hard to guess at this point. In addition, there is a lot of other uncertainty around COVID in general, the resurgences, mutations, the uptake of the vaccines. And in our business, obviously, Alaris and when that comes back in 2022 will have an impact. I would remind you that on our November call we said we expected our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing and the Alaris pump revenues, to grow in mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis. And we continue to see that as a reasonable assumption. We can\u2019t predict when the FDA clearance for Alaris and our focus on making a comprehensive filing to support a timely approval is there, but we would expect some clearance sometime in fiscal 2022. We would also not look at the second half of 2021 as a proxy of what to expect in 2022 because both the gross and operating margins are impacted by several factors. Our operating margin in fiscal 2021 reflects these incremental investments we are making as part of the investment program of Veritor that really helps drive durable growth aligned with our 2025 strategy. And we don\u2019t expect those investments to continue into 2022, so exiting 2021, they\u2019ll roll off and that should help margins going into 2022. The other thing I would point out is that Q1 fiscal 2022 will obviously be the most difficult comp from a margin perspective, given the very strong quarter we just reported. For example, most likely face the most difficult comparison with COVID revenues as well as from the impact of the timing and stocking that we talked about. So we would expect our operating margin to compress year-over-year from the 31.6% that we just achieved. So we will update you more on our thoughts on 2022 as we progress through the year, but we just thought it is important to provide some of those highlights.\nThomas Polen: Yes. And as you mentioned, Dave, we feel really good about the progress of our strategy overall and the underlying business momentum that we continue to build upon.\nDavid Lewis: Thanks so much for the detail.\nThomas Polen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on a good quarter also and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on one of the slides in the back you have that the underlying basis ex-COVID grew 4% in the quarter, which was a really healthy rate. How are you thinking about that base business ex-COVID growth through the cadence of the year here? That is a pretty healthy start in what was a tough quarter. How should we think about that component of the business throughout fiscal 2021?\nThomas Polen: Okay. Thanks, Robbie. I will let Chris answer that.\nChristopher Reidy: Yes. I think one way to think about that is what I mentioned about 2022 is that we expect the base business to be ramping at a mid-single digits. So that is consistent with that. So I think that we feel the underlying business is solidly in that kind of perspective and as we talked about the base business, we expect to be kind of in that low to mid-single-digit level for the full year. And so there is some pressures in the second half of the year on a business-by-business basis. As you think about MMS, there will be some issues. It is going to be lumpy in the remaining quarters. MMS had a significant amount of revenue in the third quarter during the pandemic last year. Other parts of the business will ramp nicely. China, for example, as we lap the COVID impact that really was in Q2 there in China, so we will start seeing some revenue growth from that. But again, that is more of a compare. It is not an indication of the underlying business. But the underlying business really is in that low to mid-single-digit basis. We have some general issues with compared to the - based on the Alaris ship hold. Some of that has been negated by medical necessity. So there is a number of factors going on. But the bottom line of it all is think about the base business, for the remainder of this year in that low to mid-single-digits and exiting into 2022 in the mid-single-digit basis.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. You are generating a pretty significant amount of cash here. You got the balance sheet in a great spot last year when things were looking pretty down for COVID, and now things are looking up. So how are you approaching the uses of this cash, particularly as we go into next year? And to follow-up on the last question, there is a question mark about how to bridge some of the earnings. What are you thinking about uses of cash, M&A opportunities across the business? And how much of that might get returned to shareholders?\nThomas Polen: Robbie, I will start with it and turn it over to Chris for some further details. Obviously, you see us investing behind our growth strategy. You see us making investments in capacity, for example, capacity investments in rapid testing, capacity investments in helping the vaccination campaigns, whether or not that is with needles and syringes or the $1.2 billion investment you saw us announced last quarter related to our pharmaceutical systems, pre-fillable devices. We are going to continue to invest in growth. Part of that investing for growth is also our tuck-in M&A strategy, and you saw us begin to accelerate our efforts in that. Last quarter, you are seeing that continue into this fiscal year. And you heard me mention, we have a robust funnel to continue that. We remain very focused with an emphasis on tuck-in M&A as I have been iterating since transitioning into the role that I\u2019m in today. As we think about more broad deployment of capital to create shareholder value, maybe Chris, comment on that?\nChristopher Reidy: Sure. Absolutely. And I would just say a few things first. We were very proud of the fact that we really focused on cash during the pandemic. And if you look back, in fact, at the third quarter of last year, our cash flow actually increased year-over-year despite the fact that the revenues were suppressed from COVID. And that was the result of a number of actions that we took in the business around inventories, receivables, payables. And so we are very proud of that. We are really focused on cash. As we mentioned at your conference last month, Robbie, we paid down $265 million of debt. That kind of gets us down to the target. So we see the leverage ratio floating down naturally without the need to pay down debt, which really says that the $5 billion-ish that we have paid down debt over the last couple of years, that strong cash flow that we are generating will be available to allocate to other value enhancements. So we have talked about primarily the tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. And as we get through this pandemic and as that safety net of cash that we have had to ride out the pandemic isn\u2019t as necessary, we will have the ability towards the end of this year. And you have seen our tuck-in M&A ramping up, the pipeline is good. We continue to look at a number of opportunities. And by the end of this year, I think we will be also talking about giving that cash back to shareholders. Because once we get through this period, we don\u2019t see the need to build up cash on the balance sheet. And so we would be returning that to shareholders after a certain amount of tuck-in M&As. So this puts us in a very good position. We have got great cash flow generation and better than ever, and that puts us in a great position to allocate that appropriately.\nThomas Polen: And we continue, just as Chris mentioned, these are all programs with momentum. We have a cash committee that meets basically every week, and we continue to have teams dedicated to that work. So I appreciate the recognition there, Robbie, an d we are going to continue that work.\nChristopher Reidy: I think that recognition also came from Moody\u2019s. We felt really good about the fact that they upgraded us to investment grade. In fact, not only did they upgrade us, but they kept the positive outlook, which we really appreciated as well. And so that puts us full investment grade across all three rating agencies, and we fully intend to stay that way Kristen Stewart Thanks for the question. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Good morning guys and congrats on a solid [indiscernible]. So maybe I will limit to one question, perhaps a two parter. On the revenue guidance, Tom, did anything change outside of the Veritor coming in at the high end? And the reason I ask is, you guys just did 6 80 in Q1. The guide of 1.5 implies a pretty drastic fall off in Veritor revenues in the back half. And Chris, the margins here, I think, would imply a sub-25% op margins for 2Q to 4Q to get to the guide. That is below your pre-pandemic levels. I\u2019m curious if there are any incremental expenses in the back half.\nThomas Polen: Hey Vijay, a nice approach with the two part one question. So on the revenue side on Veritor, so I think the key thing to talk about there is the pricing comment that I made is one big piece that drives that, right. We said we were above 20% in the last quarter. And as we think about looking forward, we talked about modeling low to mid-teens. So that is the number one adjustment there. And again, that is not new news at all the fact that we have been talking about that we expect pricing to head in that level as our capacity comes online and we are in a better cost position, et cetera. And as more capacity is coming into the marketplace, and so we have taken actions as planned. And that is why we gave guidance. It said expect the revenues to be highly weighted to the first half of the year, and we have said that from day one. I think there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness and timing of the vaccines, especially with additional variants that are out there, et cetera. But we can\u2019t predict what is going to happen there on the second half of the year. And so we remain projecting that there will be very strong demand for antigen testing in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year is less certain. Obviously, if demand stays very high and depending on the dynamics with capacity and demand and how those curves cross over, maybe there could be an opportunity in the back half of the year, but it is way too early for us to think about that as - because it is far from certain or able to be confirmed. So our aim is to position ourselves to be a leader in the space however it ends up evolving. And as we go forward, there will be more clarity there, but certainly a very dynamic environment. Maybe, Chris, on part two.\nChristopher Reidy: Sure. On margins, Vijay, Q1 margins were obviously very, very strong. And that was a function of a very, very strong. And that was a function of a number of things. First, the COVID testing, obviously. But the base business was very, very strong as well. And we drove some synergy and continuous improvement kind of margin improvements as well. So all things were positive in Q1. As we think about the rest of the year, you would year, you would expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model that out, obviously. And then don\u2019t forget you also have the unwind of the timing that we saw of the $100 million in Q1. That unwinds in the remainder of the year. But the most important thing is the ramping of investments that we have discussed. So we are investing in R&D. We are investing in quality. We are investing in the Veritor reinvestment program. And all of those things kind of ramp in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so don\u2019t think about that as an indication of our pre-pandemic margins. It is just completely different. And then those investments go away into 2022. The beauty of it is they begin to drive improvements in growth, in revenue generation, in margin expansion, and those things will kick in towards the latter half of FY 2022. So you get the pickup in margins by them going away and then the benefit of those investments in driving revenue growth and margin improvement going forward. So you can\u2019t look at that as - those are different than pre-pandemic margins. So that is the way to think benefit of those investments in driving revenue benefit of those investments in driving revenue about 2021 as it plays out.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nRobert Hopkins: Well thanks for taking the question and good morning. I will just stick to one topic, especially, Tom, since you mentioned it is still your number one priority. On Alaris refiling, are you guys just waiting on FDA at this point or is there more work that BD needs to do? And if there is more work, what still needs to be done? I\u2019m just looking for a little bit more detailed update there. Thank you.\nThomas Polen: Sure. And thanks, Bob, and good to connect. So as I mentioned, we remain on-track for the submission in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3. And we are not waiting on anything specific from the FDA. These are very comprehensive submissions, right, think 1,000 plus page filings that take time to prepare and have a lot of comprehensive data in them. And so, we have always said from the start, our focus isn\u2019t in rushing into a submission, but it is around ensuring a comprehensive submission that is going to achieve our ultimate goal, which is a timely FDA review an d clearance. And so that remains our focus from that perspective. Obviously, Q2, Q3 is coming up upon us here. The teams are making great progress, and we continue to iterate that time line. We will continue, as we have in the past, as we get to those dates, we will provide updates at public conferences or as appropriate.\nRobert Hopkins: Okay. So not that everything is into the agency and you are just waiting to hear back from them? You guys are still putting the package together to submit?\nThomas Polen: Correct. You can expect that, once we are still putting submit, we will communicate that in appropriate form, but we are preparing to submit in the time line that I mentioned.\nRobert Hopkins: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you very much. Just given that you are clearly accelerating tuck-in M&A from the capital deployment standpoint, which makes a ton of sense, especially with the COVID windfall and your free cash flow generation, should we be thinking about the contribution for what you might do on a more aggressive kind of M&A front going forward as maybe bringing you more towards kind of upper mid-single-digit kind of growth profile or even maybe high single digits? I\u2019m just trying to think through the shift in the reprioritization here, clearly, more aggressive, more on offense. Is that where we are headed once we return to a more normalized environment?\nThomas Polen: Okay. Thanks for your question. Obviously, our number one focus is on durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, and that is our aim here. And so we really see - we often refer to it inside as inorganic innovation. We look at our pipeline. We look at the market spaces that we participate in. I walked through three of our three key areas of innovation focus earlier in the call, and we evaluate constantly what products and initiatives we can fund organically and drive in-house to advance that strategy and create shareholder value and value for patients and providers. And we also are constantly looking at the external landscape as well to see what may be out there that could get to market sooner than we could or maybe has some great talent that create some really exciting innovations outside of BD that we can bring in-house. And so we are going to continue to do that, but it is all in line with, I would say, a more holistic approach to driving that durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile that people really have come to appreciate form BD. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just some things on Veritor. Can you just talk about your capacity now? And you mentioned that you are making additional investments in testing, so where would that you know capacity there where would that get you and just how to reconcile the capacity expansion that you are going through with the thoughts on the slowdown in demand? How do I reconcile this? Is this also about building for at-home testing and you tee some thoughts on exploration there? Can you just tell me what that means? Thanks.\nThomas Polen: Sure, Brian, and good to connect, as always. So the capacity is, as we have communicated in the past, right, that we are at going to 12 million tests in March is what we communicated on our last earnings call. And we are on-track for that. And we are also on-track for the MAX capacity expansion that we had described before. I don\u2019t think it is a fair thing to say that we continue to sell all of that capacity as we look forward. That is not known to us, particularly in the back half of the year. But we are positioned. This is a global pandemic that is going on in the world. As we think about opening up businesses and schools and other things, people are going to look at what different types of testing technology they can use, and our aim is to make sure that things are available to health care systems as needed. So we are doing that. And we have also shared, right, we are actually depreciating those assets within the year. So that as things unfold in 2022 and 2023, those assets won\u2019t be burdened on our P&L because we are able to fund that within the profits that are generated within this fiscal year. So that is our approach. Nothing more than that. At this point, we probably don\u2019t want to comment more on the home space other than to mention that we are actively exploring that, has been our practice as we advance our work in that and the combination assays that we have shared that are in development. We will really end up sharing more about those as we actually gain EUA and head towards launch if those occur. So I think that is it. Maybe we do have Dave Hickey on the phone. I can pause. And Dave, I don\u2019t know if there is any other comments to add from you.\nDave Hickey: No. I mean, Tom, you have captured it eloquently. I think capacity, we moved to 12 million tests per month from next month. You mentioned MAX. So MAX, actually, we did increase capacity to 1.9 million tests per month for the molecular assay from last month actually. And there are a variety of additional topics like the claims, home testing, OTC that we are exploring right now as well as additional menu to leverage the 70,000 plus Veritors that are going to be out there. And as those decisions take place, we will share more details as we get those decisions.\nThomas Polen: Yes. And those markets still are not well defined today, as you know, Brian. So thanks for the question.\nBrian Weinstein: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just one for me on. You have the BTK panel coming up on February 17th. As you guys know, that tends to get outsized attention by investors. So it sounds like you guys requested the panel. What do you think the hot topics or key issues are going to be? Every panel has them. Do you expect FDA and the panel to debate whether it Should be six-month efficacy, that is the focus or 12-month data? Your level of confidence in the outcome? And do you still see this as kind of a $150 million opportunity, which is kind of what Bard thought it was before the acquisition.\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Larry, and great question. Let me maybe make a short comment here, and then we have Simon Campion on the phone, and we will turn it over to him, who is deeply versed in this. So first off, just as a reminder, we have nothing in our forward-looking plan for BTK approval, right. It is not in our 2021 plan. It is in no forward-looking outlook that we have as we think about how we model things within the company. Today, Lutonix revenues are less than 1% of our overall BD revenue. And this indication, specifically, again, is not included in our forecast. As we go into the panel, and Simon will share more detail on this, the one thing that we have is we know this is a highly underserved market, and we know that our clinical trial data shows very strongly that it is safe, that Lutonix is safe in this patient population. I think it is the first product that is gone through a trial in the U.S. that has the ability to do that. Now the question is, are the clinical outcomes that were shown in our trial sufficient enough for it to be warranted for an approval. And so Simon, let me turn it over to you to talk a little bit more about that.\nSimon Campion: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So as Tom just reiterated, the safety profile of DCBs and the BTK in particular has been, I think, has been well discussed. And the data that we are providing is demonstrating continued safety of the Lutonix product. We did request the panel meeting, as you know, below the knee patients with critical limb ischemia are in a very bad way. It is the most serious from of peripheral arterial disease. They have multiple comorbidities.  And some of the most important things for this patient population are: a, options; and b, an opportunity to expand the gap between these frequent interventions that they will have. So as we move into panel, certainly, there will be a debate around the clinical data that we have acquired. But I think, more importantly, this is another tool in [indiscernible] of tools that clinicians have for BTK intervention. If you think back 20-years ago, an SFA or intervention, there were PTA balloons and off-label stents. And today, there is a wide range of technology available to them all the way up to balloons and drug-eluting stent. But in BTK today, as I said, the most serious form of peripheral arterial disease, there is one product available, and that is PTA. So we are not suggesting this is the silver bullet for all BTK patients. We are suggesting that this is another tool that can enhance the outcomes for different patients and equip physicians to assess each and every patient and have yet another tool to treat them with. So the panel is on February 17th. We have gone through a comprehensive preparation for it, and we will absolutely put our best foot forward on [indiscernible] application.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nThomas Polen: Great. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.\nLawrence Keusch: Good morning everyone. So Tom, I wanted to just touch on the investment spend that you guys talked a lot about. And certainly, you have really amped up the conversation around that over the past couple of quarters. And I guess I\u2019m really focused in on the R&D side of things. I feel like I have heard this story in the past here at BD, and there is been some challenges with innovation and really getting products out onto the market that were considered to be more than just evolutionary. So I get the sense that things are probably different this time around, but I\u2019m just trying to understand if there is a new approach or are you investing differently or anything that you can kind of speak to help us get comfortable that these investments hopefully can lead to visible new product introductions.\nThomas Polen: Truly. Yes. Good and fair question. So let me start with just over all R&D effectiveness, and I can give a little bit of color on the types of initiatives that we are investing in here and also how we think about our overall innovation system. So as you know, John DeFord joined us as our Chief Technology Officer about three years ago. And really, under his leadership, there is been tremendous progress within the organization and with the segment teams, the business teams in advancing our ability to drive innovation. Actually, over that time period, we have gone from kind of the midpoint of not being where we wanted in terms of on-time milestone delivery or on-time launches to being as we benchmark ourselves to being in the top quartile within the industry of hitting our milestones and, most importantly, hitting our launches, right. Our launches are now about 80 plus percent of our launches are on time, which is up very notably over the last three years, up over 30 percentage points or around 30 percentage points, in fact. So we see the progress being made. And that is the result of a lot of system improvements, new capabilities brought in, taking some of the best practices actually from Bard and the acquisition and applying those across the company. So that is something we are going to continue to build upon. As we think about the innovations that we are investing in, as we look at those, there is a few, as I think about them, kind of new to world innovations that are in our pipeline. I mean, one is some of the ones we have already talked about, right, non-COVID menu expansion on Veritor and MAX to capitalize on our expanded footprint. We have a strong track record of developing new assays on MAX and Veritor, right. It is just examples of that. Other initiatives are accelerating programs that we already had in our pipeline and allowing them to come to market a year or two earlier than we originally projected. That is an area of investment that we are making, and there are a number of areas in each of the segments which we are accelerating new products into the pipeline, but they are all very much in line with our strategy and areas that we are confident that we have internal capabilities in. Of course, what we are also doing that is complementing that is that tuck-in M&A strategy that I mentioned before. And we do think about often, and we will have those discussions internally, if technologies are better developed in-house or that we should be going outside because we don\u2019t have those capabilities in-house. And we will either look at do they exist today in someone else\u2019s pipeline and is that an opportunity for tuck-in M&A? Or do we need to be doing collaborations with outside groups. There is many R&D programs that we have today, I think probably a record level of R&D programs where we have external partnership s in place. Actually, the BD COR would be one that I mentioned before. We have very strong external partnerships with the robotics because that is a very advanced automation system. And so we brought in robotic experts that helped us with that launch, and it is going really well in Europe. And we will bring it to the U.S. here, but that is one that we probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to develop in the same way if we had tried to do it on our own, but we are seeing successes with that approach, and we are seeing it in many other areas as well. So that is kind of maybe just a little bit of color, Larry, in how we think about it overall. But with that progress that we have made and the way that we have thought through making these investments and how we also think about where it is smarter for us to do tuck-in M&A, we are confident in those investments.\nLawrence Keusch: Okay. very good. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi thank you for taking the questions. So I just wanted to ask about the Veritor pricing from the standpoint of how that came about. I usually would think about it as being more of a competitive dynamic, but it seems like, for your comments, you are being a little bit more proactive to lower price to make it a better value proposition for stakeholders. And so I wanted to understand: a, how that came about; and b, do you expect it to go down further in the future or do you think this is a point of equilibrium?\nThomas Polen: Yes. Good question, Matt. So yes, you are right. It is a combination of - we have always said that we believe the pricing would head in this direction. Our capacity is increasing, and we want to be proactive in maintaining that leadership position. But there is additional capacity coming in the industry now as well, too. And there will be further capacity coming in. We are not the only company who is adding in capacity. And so we think about that holistically and where pricing as a result of that is going today and where we best position our products to remain a leader in that, and that is how we develop it, and we spend a lot of time thinking those things through as to when and how we optimize our pricing, again, to also serve what is a continued evolving customer base as more nontraditional areas of health care wanting to do antigen testing and making sure that it is appropriately priced to enable the broadest access to the product while we are still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we have gotten very positive receptivity so the pricing. We have already started to roll that out a couple of weeks ago last month. And so good question. Thank you, Matt.\nMatthew Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one on Veritor, just with the U.K. and South African variants. I think the U.K. ran some studies on rapid antigen testing and confirmed that there was no change in sensitivity or specificity. If we think about the South African variant and the U.K. variant and future variants, what is back in doing to just monitor those variants and ensure that the sensitivity and specificity aren\u2019t altered by some of the mutations in the virus and then the subsequent antigens that you guys are testing for? Thanks.\nThomas Polen: Good question, Josh. And that is certainly something that our teams are all over. Let me turn it over to Dave Hicky, who we have got on the line, the President of our Life Science segment.\nDave Hickey: Thank you, Tom. And Josh, great question. So to your point, there have been obviously several newly identified variants reported recently, and there could well be others, right, recognizing that this is an RNA virus, very much like influenza and HIV that are known to mutate. And for us, we have got two different types of platforms, right. So we have obviously got the BD Veritor antigen test. We have got the BD MAX and molecular PC assays. So let me take MAX first. So for BD Max and for the assays that we have on the MAX, we have already completed an in-silico analysis, which is a computer model based on sequencing. And to look at those mutations. And from everything that we can see around those mutations and the lineage of the sequence, we have no impact on the BD MAX assays. For BD Veritor, which is obviously more a minor assay based on the top of the protein, based on early analysis again there, we have no evidence to show that the U.K., South African and, indeed, Brazilian variant will have an impact on the test. But we continue to take actions to look at that, further confirm and monitor the performance. And again, we have done that for the ones that are already out there and any potential new emerging strains. And this is a critical topic for us because I think the thing to remember here is as these variants come online and come out, which are reportedly more transmissible, it makes the importance of rapid testing and access to testing as important, if not more important, than ever. Thanks for the question Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nThomas Polen: Okay. Well, thank you, and thanks, obviously, to everyone for your questions. Just before we sign off, I would be remiss if I did not thank BD\u2019s 70,000 associates around the globe who every day rally around our purpose of advancing the world of health. Your efforts and achievements this quarter were noticed. You continue to work tirelessly to make sure that our needed products reach the frontline to combat this pandemic while executing on our strategic agenda. I\u2019m proud of how we have started our fiscal 2021, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to deliver on our goals of developing innovative devices and making meaningful health impacts to people around the world. On behalf of the entire executive team, thank you for your efforts and sacrifices. Onward we go together. And like you, I\u2019m proud to be BD. Thank you for listening today, and we look forward to connecting at in future investor meetings with everyone who is joined the call. And until then, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. Thank you.\nChristopher Reidy: Thanks, everyone.\nKristen Stewart: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our Q1 results, which were ahead of our expectations, reflecting the tremendous efforts and execution of BD's 70,000 associates. The essential role of our products and solutions and healthcare and a greater resiliency of the health care system in treating both COVID and non-COVID patients. While our fiscal year has just started, I'm proud of the team for the momentum we are building and their dedication to our purpose of advancing the world of health. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis or 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis, with 20.3 percentage points of growth coming from our COVID-19 diagnostic revenues. While we did see some benefits from timing in the quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of the base business, which was up 4% against the backdrop of COVID resurgences around the world. We are seeing the early benefits of some of the actions we have taken to drive our base performance. Our adjusted EPS were $4.55 or up 72% versus the prior year. This was also well above our expectations as a result of three factors. First, our revenues came in above our plan, driven by higher acuity, driving increased demand, greater resiliency and procedural volumes and exceptional execution in COVID diagnostics. Second, we benefited from favorable product mix, like Veritor, but also from our higher acuity products. Third, our investment spending, such as in R&D, was lighter and earlier in ramping. So as you can see, we started this year with strong momentum, and that is despite the COVID resurgence. We did start to see some impact of the resurgence on our more elective procedure related businesses late in December, and that continued into January. However, we are feeling more confident in the resiliency of our base business relative to what we saw early on in the pandemic. While the health care markets continue to be dynamic with COVID-19, and there are a number of moving parts, the momentum within BD and our conviction in our strategy lead us to raise our financial guidance for fiscal 2021. Our focus is not only on fulfilling our near-term commitments, but also on advancing our strategy and creating value for our shareholders over the longer term. And I'm feeling even greater confidence with the progress the BD team is making in advancing the BD 2025 Grow, Simplify and Empower initiatives and our ability to create substantial shareholder value. Today, I want to focus my remarks on three key topics, and then I will turn it over to Chris, who will provide additional remarks on our quarter's performance and comment on our outlook, then we will take your questions. So let's jump right in. First, let me start with the Alaris remediation and our overall quality and compliance initiatives. Alaris remediation has and continues to be my number one priority, and the team is making strong progress. Our focus remains on submitting a comprehensive 510(k) filing for the Alaris system, and we remain on-track to submit it in late fiscal Q2 or early fiscal Q3 2021. We also continue to make progress on executing our holistic Inspire Quality initiatives throughout the organization. Second, as you know, we have a very strong focus on growth and ensuring a durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile, so let me share some of the exciting highlights in our pipeline and other growth initiatives. We continue to increase our investments and strengthen our pipeline across three innovation themes that leverage our core strengths. First, we are applying smart devices, robotics, analytics and AI to improve care processes. Second, we are enabling new care settings to enhance patient experience and lower costs. This includes investing in products designed for use in the home markets and in sales channels to support these patients. And third, we are investing to improve diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease.  So in line with these innovation and investment priorities, in Q1, we acquired the medical assets of CUBEX, which expands our medication management offering by combining a cloud-based, easy-to-deploy analytics platform with a smart tabletop dispensing device to create solutions for the fast growing non-acute care market. This extends our medication management solution from the hospital into the long-term care surgery centers and other non-acute locations. Another smart device we plan on launching this quarter is the Sensica automated urine output system, which leverages BD's leading position in acute urology, along with BD's broad EMR interoperability capabilities and installed base. Also within BD Interventional, the BD PureWick urine collection system and catheter continues to be a significant driver of growth for our urology and critical care business. PureWick is a female external urinary catheter and urine collection system that we sell into the acute care and long-term care settings, but we are now actively extending that directly to patients with our new PureWick dry dock system for the home. And this launch is exceeding our expectations. And in fact, PureWick revenues now exceeds Lutonix. An exciting launch later this year, designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, is the U.S. launch of our new BD COR with our BD Onclarity HPV assay with extended genotyping. With BD COR, BD is going to enter the high throughput molecular testing market with a very unique, fully automated sample-to-answer platform in a highly differentiated assay with unique claims that can improve risk stratification and support risk-based patient management. The system has been CE-Marked and has been very well received by our customers during our launch in Europe. These are just a few of the many products in our pipeline, and you can find further details on our new innovations in the supplemental earnings presentation posted to our website. As we have previously shared, we are investing a portion of our Veritor profits to advance our BD 2025 strategy. We expanded the size of the BD Innovation and Growth Fund, and additional innovation projects are being initiated on a rolling basis. We are investing to accelerate our simplification initiatives, including recode and enhancing our quality and compliance programs. We are also increasing funding in our BD University to support advanced employee education and leadership development as part of our strategy. As we always do with our spending, we are taking a disciplined approach, and the timing of the spending was lighter in Q1, and we expect it to step up in Q2 and remain higher for the balance of the fiscal year. As we have mentioned before, we continue to actively evaluate tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our growth strategy. And we executed on three strategic tuck-in transactions so far this year, including CUBEX's medical assets that I mentioned earlier. We continue to apply a disciplined financial and strategic evaluation process to these transactions and have a robust funnel up. Lastly, I would like to update you on our COVID diagnostics outlook and specifically Veritor. Antigen testing continues to become more widely used in both traditional and nontraditional settings. We have been highly successful with our BD Veritor Plus COVID-19 launch. Veritor has been well received for the ease of use, performance and automated digital data and informatics capabilities that are provided with our handheld platform. We have nearly tripled our active reader base since the pandemic and now have more than 70,000 BD Veritor analyzers globally, which we intend to leverage in the future with planned non-COVID menu expansion, which we have already begun investing behind. As previously shared, we continue to make good progress on advancing new COVID diagnostics in our pipeline, including combination flu A/B and COVID-19 assays on both BD MAX and Veritor. We also continue to explore home testing on BD Veritor. It has been our practice we will provide updates to these programs upon launch. Turning to the quarter's performance. Our Q1 COVID-19 diagnostics revenues were higher than we expected at $867 million, which included better than expected BD Veritor rapid point-of-care antigen test revenues of $688 million and higher BD MAX COVID assays and collection swabs and transport devices. The higher than expected Veritor revenues were the result of our ability to scale our manufacturing faster, which is a testament to our manufacturing excellence, as well as realizing higher pricing than we anticipated. However, since we have been saying since last fall, we do expect pricing to move lower as capacity came online, and this is what is playing out. We recently lowered our pricing to allow the broadest patient access to our best-in-class BD Veritor Plus System. We believe this price adjustment is in the best interest of our customers and patients around the world as we have now ramped our manufacturing capacity, and there are emerging mutations that are making it more transmissible. We also believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders as we believe this move allows us to maintain a leadership position in the point-of-care market. With respect to our fiscal 2021 Veritor revenue guidance, as we have been discussing, there continues to be many variables at play besides the evolving pricing environment, including the rollout and adoption of vaccines and the circulation of new COVID variants. It is also difficult to pinpoint when the market supply for antigen tests will exceed market demand. For modeling purposes, we would suggest using an ASP in the low to mid-teens. Given all this, we expect Veritor revenues to be toward the high end of our previous range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect Veritor revenues to be more weighted to the first half of our fiscal year. And given the evolving pricing and capacity environment, we would expect our fiscal Q2 revenues to be lower than our just reported Q1 results. Before turning it over to Chris to review the financials, I want to close with a few thoughts. While we were very pleased with the performance of Veritor and other COVID diagnostic revenues in the quarter, what excites us more was the improving momentum and resiliency of the base business. While we saw some headwinds in our procedure based businesses from the resurgence late in December and that continued into January, the impact was much more limited than at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, given the momentum in our base business, the investments we are making in our BD 2025 strategy, we believe we are positioned to emerge strong. We remain on-track to submit our Alaris 510(k) filing in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3, and we are making great progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy. And I'm particularly pleased with the investment programs we have identified and initiated. These investments allow us to further fulfill our purpose of advancing the world of health, bringing new innovations to patients and expand access. Increased spending will be more evident in our P&L later in this fiscal year, but we believe these initiatives will translate into revenue accretion beginning in late FY 2022 and beyond. The investments we are making are also towards simplification initiatives, which reduce complexities, drive cost efficiencies, enhance our quality programs and improve cash flows. This quarter, we made several advancements on this front, including inventory reductions that we absorbed in our gross margin in the quarter that helped us strengthen our cash flows. Our ReCoDe efforts are on-track to achieve our targeted $300 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024. We are also advancing our sustainability initiatives because we view sustainability as a strategic imperative. And we recently announced the first of our 2030 and beyond goals, our climate change targets. We are committed to reducing Scope one and two greenhouse gas emissions 46% by 2030 and to be carbon-neutral across direct operations by 2040. The science based target is aligned with the 1.5-degree C global emissions reduction pathway. And we look forward to sharing more detail behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements. And finally, I'm very proud of the organization for being named for four consecutive years to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality list and for the second straight year to the Gender Quality Index. Inclusion and diversity is an important focus for BD as we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent as well as benefit from diversity of background and thought. I look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A portion of this call, and I will turn it over to Chris now. Dave, this is Tom. Thanks for the comment. Just to reiterate what Chris mentioned, that other topic is that we still are in the middle of a pandemic. We want to be prudent, right. We did see some increases on impacts in procedure volumes in this late December and throughout January. It was certainly less than what we had seen earlier in the pandemic. But there are new strains underway, et cetera. And when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we said it excluded, right, the impact of a resurgence. Well, there has been a resurgence. And we have been navigating that very well and actually are raising our outlook in the middle of a resurgence. So we will continue to evaluate as things go forward, but we are certainly pleased with how we started the year. Yes, I will start on that, and then I will turn it to Chris as well to share some comments. Let me maybe focus on specifically COVID testing, and then Chris can make some broader comments on the broader business. And we have shared, by the way, in the past, we still remain very confident and expect our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing, and Alaris pump revenues to grow in those mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis for 2022, and that remains our aim and our expectation. In terms of COVID testing as we go into 2022, certainly, as I had shared before, as we got into COVID rapid testing in last July, obviously, we didn't have a high expectation that there would be much testing in 2022. And as kind of each quarter has passed since that launch, in July, we have said we are feeling more confident there is going to be some level of testing in FY 2022 and that certainly remains the case. I think one of the ways to think about, as our capacity has gone up in the space, as we recognize the new strains coming in the market, as antigen testing continues to increase in its receptivity and people understand now the value in increasing ways of getting a test result in 15 minutes, you saw us take some actions this quarter to get pricing in that low to mid-teen level, which we think will be more - actually position us well to, as I said, to maintain a leadership position for whatever market continues to evolve going into FY 2022, right. That is part of the thinking. Where the actual market ends up in 2022? I don't know at this point in time. I think there definitely should be some level of testing. And our aim is to make sure that we are positioned to be a leader in however that testing evolves. And other things that we are investing in as well, be it our combination assay, which is progressing well in our pipeline, the flu COVID assay for our exploration of home testing are all aimed with that thought in mind as well. So maybe, Chris, just maybe some broader comments on FY 2022. Yes. And as you mentioned, Dave, we feel really good about the progress of our strategy overall and the underlying business momentum that we continue to build upon. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Robbie. I will let Chris answer that. Robbie, I will start with it and turn it over to Chris for some further details. Obviously, you see us investing behind our growth strategy. You see us making investments in capacity, for example, capacity investments in rapid testing, capacity investments in helping the vaccination campaigns, whether or not that is with needles and syringes or the $1.2 billion investment you saw us announced last quarter related to our pharmaceutical systems, pre-fillable devices. We are going to continue to invest in growth. Part of that investing for growth is also our tuck-in M&A strategy, and you saw us begin to accelerate our efforts in that. Last quarter, you are seeing that continue into this fiscal year. And you heard me mention, we have a robust funnel to continue that. We remain very focused with an emphasis on tuck-in M&A as I have been iterating since transitioning into the role that I'm in today. As we think about more broad deployment of capital to create shareholder value, maybe Chris, comment on that? And we continue, just as Chris mentioned, these are all programs with momentum. We have a cash committee that meets basically every week, and we continue to have teams dedicated to that work. So I appreciate the recognition there, Robbie, an d we are going to continue that work. Hey Vijay, a nice approach with the two part one question. So on the revenue side on Veritor, so I think the key thing to talk about there is the pricing comment that I made is one big piece that drives that, right. We said we were above 20% in the last quarter. And as we think about looking forward, we talked about modeling low to mid-teens. So that is the number one adjustment there. And again, that is not new news at all the fact that we have been talking about that we expect pricing to head in that level as our capacity comes online and we are in a better cost position, et cetera. And as more capacity is coming into the marketplace, and so we have taken actions as planned. And that is why we gave guidance. It said expect the revenues to be highly weighted to the first half of the year, and we have said that from day one. I think there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness and timing of the vaccines, especially with additional variants that are out there, et cetera. But we can't predict what is going to happen there on the second half of the year. And so we remain projecting that there will be very strong demand for antigen testing in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year is less certain. Obviously, if demand stays very high and depending on the dynamics with capacity and demand and how those curves cross over, maybe there could be an opportunity in the back half of the year, but it is way too early for us to think about that as - because it is far from certain or able to be confirmed. So our aim is to position ourselves to be a leader in the space however it ends up evolving. And as we go forward, there will be more clarity there, but certainly a very dynamic environment. Maybe, Chris, on part two. Sure. And thanks, Bob, and good to connect. So as I mentioned, we remain on-track for the submission in late fiscal Q2 or early Q3. And we are not waiting on anything specific from the FDA. These are very comprehensive submissions, right, think 1,000 plus page filings that take time to prepare and have a lot of comprehensive data in them. And so, we have always said from the start, our focus isn't in rushing into a submission, but it is around ensuring a comprehensive submission that is going to achieve our ultimate goal, which is a timely FDA review an d clearance. And so that remains our focus from that perspective. Obviously, Q2, Q3 is coming up upon us here. The teams are making great progress, and we continue to iterate that time line. We will continue, as we have in the past, as we get to those dates, we will provide updates at public conferences or as appropriate. Correct. You can expect that, once we are still putting submit, we will communicate that in appropriate form, but we are preparing to submit in the time line that I mentioned. Okay. Thanks for your question. Obviously, our number one focus is on durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, and that is our aim here. And so we really see - we often refer to it inside as inorganic innovation. We look at our pipeline. We look at the market spaces that we participate in. I walked through three of our three key areas of innovation focus earlier in the call, and we evaluate constantly what products and initiatives we can fund organically and drive in-house to advance that strategy and create shareholder value and value for patients and providers. And we also are constantly looking at the external landscape as well to see what may be out there that could get to market sooner than we could or maybe has some great talent that create some really exciting innovations outside of BD that we can bring in-house. And so we are going to continue to do that, but it is all in line with, I would say, a more holistic approach to driving that durable mid-single-digit revenue growth profile that people really have come to appreciate form BD. Thanks for the question. Sure, Brian, and good to connect, as always. So the capacity is, as we have communicated in the past, right, that we are at going to 12 million tests in March is what we communicated on our last earnings call. And we are on-track for that. And we are also on-track for the MAX capacity expansion that we had described before. I don't think it is a fair thing to say that we continue to sell all of that capacity as we look forward. That is not known to us, particularly in the back half of the year. But we are positioned. This is a global pandemic that is going on in the world. As we think about opening up businesses and schools and other things, people are going to look at what different types of testing technology they can use, and our aim is to make sure that things are available to health care systems as needed. So we are doing that. And we have also shared, right, we are actually depreciating those assets within the year. So that as things unfold in 2022 and 2023, those assets won't be burdened on our P&L because we are able to fund that within the profits that are generated within this fiscal year. So that is our approach. Nothing more than that. At this point, we probably don't want to comment more on the home space other than to mention that we are actively exploring that, has been our practice as we advance our work in that and the combination assays that we have shared that are in development. We will really end up sharing more about those as we actually gain EUA and head towards launch if those occur. So I think that is it. Maybe we do have Dave Hickey on the phone. I can pause. And Dave, I don't know if there is any other comments to add from you. Yes. And those markets still are not well defined today, as you know, Brian. So thanks for the question. Thanks, Larry, and great question. Let me maybe make a short comment here, and then we have Simon Campion on the phone, and we will turn it over to him, who is deeply versed in this. So first off, just as a reminder, we have nothing in our forward-looking plan for BTK approval, right. It is not in our 2021 plan. It is in no forward-looking outlook that we have as we think about how we model things within the company. Today, Lutonix revenues are less than 1% of our overall BD revenue. And this indication, specifically, again, is not included in our forecast. As we go into the panel, and Simon will share more detail on this, the one thing that we have is we know this is a highly underserved market, and we know that our clinical trial data shows very strongly that it is safe, that Lutonix is safe in this patient population. I think it is the first product that is gone through a trial in the U.S. that has the ability to do that. Now the question is, are the clinical outcomes that were shown in our trial sufficient enough for it to be warranted for an approval. And so Simon, let me turn it over to you to talk a little bit more about that. Great. Thanks for the question. Truly. Yes. Good and fair question. So let me start with just over all R&D effectiveness, and I can give a little bit of color on the types of initiatives that we are investing in here and also how we think about our overall innovation system. So as you know, John DeFord joined us as our Chief Technology Officer about three years ago. And really, under his leadership, there is been tremendous progress within the organization and with the segment teams, the business teams in advancing our ability to drive innovation. Actually, over that time period, we have gone from kind of the midpoint of not being where we wanted in terms of on-time milestone delivery or on-time launches to being as we benchmark ourselves to being in the top quartile within the industry of hitting our milestones and, most importantly, hitting our launches, right. Our launches are now about 80 plus percent of our launches are on time, which is up very notably over the last three years, up over 30 percentage points or around 30 percentage points, in fact. So we see the progress being made. And that is the result of a lot of system improvements, new capabilities brought in, taking some of the best practices actually from Bard and the acquisition and applying those across the company. So that is something we are going to continue to build upon. As we think about the innovations that we are investing in, as we look at those, there is a few, as I think about them, kind of new to world innovations that are in our pipeline. I mean, one is some of the ones we have already talked about, right, non-COVID menu expansion on Veritor and MAX to capitalize on our expanded footprint. We have a strong track record of developing new assays on MAX and Veritor, right. It is just examples of that. Other initiatives are accelerating programs that we already had in our pipeline and allowing them to come to market a year or two earlier than we originally projected. That is an area of investment that we are making, and there are a number of areas in each of the segments which we are accelerating new products into the pipeline, but they are all very much in line with our strategy and areas that we are confident that we have internal capabilities in. Of course, what we are also doing that is complementing that is that tuck-in M&A strategy that I mentioned before. And we do think about often, and we will have those discussions internally, if technologies are better developed in-house or that we should be going outside because we don't have those capabilities in-house. And we will either look at do they exist today in someone else's pipeline and is that an opportunity for tuck-in M&A? Or do we need to be doing collaborations with outside groups. There is many R&D programs that we have today, I think probably a record level of R&D programs where we have external partnership s in place. Actually, the BD COR would be one that I mentioned before. We have very strong external partnerships with the robotics because that is a very advanced automation system. And so we brought in robotic experts that helped us with that launch, and it is going really well in Europe. And we will bring it to the U.S. here, but that is one that we probably wouldn't have been able to develop in the same way if we had tried to do it on our own, but we are seeing successes with that approach, and we are seeing it in many other areas as well. So that is kind of maybe just a little bit of color, Larry, in how we think about it overall. But with that progress that we have made and the way that we have thought through making these investments and how we also think about where it is smarter for us to do tuck-in M&A, we are confident in those investments. Yes. Good question, Matt. So yes, you are right. It is a combination of - we have always said that we believe the pricing would head in this direction. Our capacity is increasing, and we want to be proactive in maintaining that leadership position. But there is additional capacity coming in the industry now as well, too. And there will be further capacity coming in. We are not the only company who is adding in capacity. And so we think about that holistically and where pricing as a result of that is going today and where we best position our products to remain a leader in that, and that is how we develop it, and we spend a lot of time thinking those things through as to when and how we optimize our pricing, again, to also serve what is a continued evolving customer base as more nontraditional areas of health care wanting to do antigen testing and making sure that it is appropriately priced to enable the broadest access to the product while we are still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we have gotten very positive receptivity so the pricing. We have already started to roll that out a couple of weeks ago last month. And so good question. Thank you, Matt. Good question, Josh. And that is certainly something that our teams are all over. Let me turn it over to Dave Hicky, who we have got on the line, the President of our Life Science segment. Okay. Well, thank you, and thanks, obviously, to everyone for your questions. Just before we sign off, I would be remiss if I did not thank BD's 70,000 associates around the globe who every day rally around our purpose of advancing the world of health. Your efforts and achievements this quarter were noticed. You continue to work tirelessly to make sure that our needed products reach the frontline to combat this pandemic while executing on our strategic agenda. I'm proud of how we have started our fiscal 2021, and I'm looking forward to continuing to deliver on our goals of developing innovative devices and making meaningful health impacts to people around the world. On behalf of the entire executive team, thank you for your efforts and sacrifices. Onward we go together. And like you, I'm proud to be BD. Thank you for listening today, and we look forward to connecting at in future investor meetings with everyone who is joined the call. And until then, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. Thank you."

            "name": "Simon Campion",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Tom. So as Tom just reiterated, the safety profile of DCBs and the BTK in particular has been, I think, has been well discussed. And the data that we are providing is demonstrating continued safety of the Lutonix product. We did request the panel meeting, as you know, below the knee patients with critical limb ischemia are in a very bad way. It is the most serious from of peripheral arterial disease. They have multiple comorbidities.  And some of the most important things for this patient population are: a, options; and b, an opportunity to expand the gap between these frequent interventions that they will have. So as we move into panel, certainly, there will be a debate around the clinical data that we have acquired. But I think, more importantly, this is another tool in [indiscernible] of tools that clinicians have for BTK intervention. If you think back 20-years ago, an SFA or intervention, there were PTA balloons and off-label stents. And today, there is a wide range of technology available to them all the way up to balloons and drug-eluting stent. But in BTK today, as I said, the most serious form of peripheral arterial disease, there is one product available, and that is PTA. So we are not suggesting this is the silver bullet for all BTK patients. We are suggesting that this is another tool that can enhance the outcomes for different patients and equip physicians to assess each and every patient and have yet another tool to treat them with. So the panel is on February 17th. We have gone through a comprehensive preparation for it, and we will absolutely put our best foot forward on [indiscernible] application."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "No. I mean, Tom, you have captured it eloquently. I think capacity, we moved to 12 million tests per month from next month. You mentioned MAX. So MAX, actually, we did increase capacity to 1.9 million tests per month for the molecular assay from last month actually. And there are a variety of additional topics like the claims, home testing, OTC that we are exploring right now as well as additional menu to leverage the 70,000 plus Veritors that are going to be out there. And as those decisions take place, we will share more details as we get those decisions. Thank you, Tom. And Josh, great question. So to your point, there have been obviously several newly identified variants reported recently, and there could well be others, right, recognizing that this is an RNA virus, very much like influenza and HIV that are known to mutate. And for us, we have got two different types of platforms, right. So we have obviously got the BD Veritor antigen test. We have got the BD MAX and molecular PC assays. So let me take MAX first. So for BD Max and for the assays that we have on the MAX, we have already completed an in-silico analysis, which is a computer model based on sequencing. And to look at those mutations. And from everything that we can see around those mutations and the lineage of the sequence, we have no impact on the BD MAX assays. For BD Veritor, which is obviously more a minor assay based on the top of the protein, based on early analysis again there, we have no evidence to show that the U.K., South African and, indeed, Brazilian variant will have an impact on the test. But we continue to take actions to look at that, further confirm and monitor the performance. And again, we have done that for the ones that are already out there and any potential new emerging strains. And this is a critical topic for us because I think the thing to remember here is as these variants come online and come out, which are reportedly more transmissible, it makes the importance of rapid testing and access to testing as important, if not more important, than ever. Thanks for the question Josh."

            "name": "Christopher Reidy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our fiscal first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share performance, both of which exceeded our expectations. Total revenues were over $5.3billion, in line with our January 12 pre-announcement. Revenues increased 25.8% on a reported basis and 24.3% on an FX-neutral basis. COVID-19 diagnostic revenues accounted for 20.3 percentage points of growth. The better than expected performance came from three areas: first, our base business performed better than expected. This was a result of stronger execution from our associates, greater resiliency and procedure volumes as health care facilities manage both COVID and non-COVID patients, and higher acuity resulted in both favorable product mix and increased demand for several product lines. Keep in mind, though, that some of our business segments are still operating below pre-COVID volume levels. Second, our COVID diagnostic revenues were higher than expected. This included not only Veritor revenues but also MAX and swab and transport revenues. Lastly, we estimated about $100 million in revenues were attributable to stocking and timing. As COVID-19 surges were occurring, we observed some of our customers moving to more of a just-in-case level of inventory and maintaining higher levels of our critical need products on hand. We also saw some of our U.K. customers buying more ahead of Brexit. The $100 million includes higher than expected revenues in our MMS Infusion Systems business due to COVID-19. BD Medical revenues totaled nearly $2.3 billion and grew 6.9% on an FX-neutral basis. Our outperformance was primarily in Medication Delivery Solutions as well as in Medication Management Solutions. MDS revenues were up 5.6%, while hospital utilization remains below pre-COVID levels and has been an ongoing headwind, we benefited from the acuity of care associated with the treatment of COVID patients. We saw increased demand for Pyxis vascular prep and maintenance. As I mentioned, we believe stocking of critical need products helped the quarter. Finally, as expected, there was $37 million in revenues associated with COVID vaccination syringes and needles. Now turning to our MMS business. Revenues grew 8.4%, with growth in both Medication Dispensing and Infusion Systems. In dispensing, we had strong growth internationally and once again exited the quarter with strong committed contracts in the U.S. in Infusion Systems, we continue to support U.S. customers' response during the pandemic on the medical necessity and experienced another quarter of strong demand in Europe. In Diabetes Care, revenue growth of 5.4% was above our expectations, reflecting distributor inventory stocking in addition to an easy comparison to last year. We still view this business to be more of a flattish business on a normalized basis. Pharm systems sales remained strong, growing 9.5%, driven by ongoing demand for our market leading prefilled syringe portfolio. BD Life Science revenues totaled nearly $2 billion and were up 74.1% on an FX-neutral basis. As I mentioned previously, COVID diagnostic revenues were $867 million in the quarter. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, BD Life Sciences revenues were down 2.4%, which was better than we expected. Integrated Diagnostic Solution revenues increased by 106% due to COVID-19 diagnostic testing revenues. Excluding these COVID diagnostic testing revenues, IDS revenues were down just 1.2%. There were several puts and takes in the base business. We saw a stronger than expected performance in our specimen management, blood culture and women's health and cancer product lines. We also saw some element of distributor stocking that is critical to health care testing. However, while we have seen improvements, routine diagnostic testing activities are not fully back to pre COVID-19 levels and a significantly lighter flu season negatively impacted the base revenue growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now turning to Biosciences. Revenue declined by 5.2% due to a difficult comparison as a result of prior year licensing revenue. In addition, clinical and research activities are not yet fully back to pre COVID-19 levels. Overall, operational performance in Biosciences was better than expected. BD interventional revenues totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up 5% on an FX-neutral basis, with all business units posting growth. We observed that elective procedures, particularly those conducted in an outpatient setting, had greater resiliency in Q1 compare d to the initial wave of COVID. This was likely driven by processes and care settings that enable elective procedures to continue despite the resurgence and a greater willingness on the part of patients to attend to their scheduled elective procedures. Surgery sales were up 1.3% as strong sales growth in our Infection Prevention business was offset by the ongoing headwinds related to lower procedures due to the pandemic. Peripheral Intervention sales were up 5.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance across our peripheral arterial disease platforms. Urology and Critical Care turned in another quarter of strong growth, with revenues up 8%. PureWick continues to fuel the growth in our acute urology franchise while our new connected Arctic Sun System is driving double-digit growth in our targeted temperature management business. This is another example of BD leveraging our digital capabilities and broad EMR interoperability footprint to bring new innovations to market. Now turning to the P&L. We were really pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margins were 58.2%, which expanded 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. On an FX-neutral basis, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points, which was primarily driven by COVID diagnostics and higher-acuity products. While SSG&A and R&D spending were both higher on a year-over-year basis, the level of spending was lower than we anticipated, particularly R&D, reflecting mainly timing. Operating margins were 31.6%, up 830 basis points on an FX-neutral basis, which was driven by higher gross margins and reduced SG&A and R&D spending. Net interest expense was $118 million, down slightly on a sequential basis. Other income was $30 million versus $27 million a year ago, and the adjusted tax rate came in at 14.6%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted non-GAAP EPS were $4.55. In fiscal Q1, the preferred shares are dilutive. Therefore, in calculating the adjusted non-GAAP EPS, preferred dividends amount of $23 million was excluded from the numerator, while the diluted share count would be adjusted to include the dilutive impact of the convertible preferred shares and would be 299.1 million. As we have been discussing, our BD 2025 strategy includes a focus on driving cash flow, and we were really pleased with the continued progress of these initiatives and our cash flow performance. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $1.3 billion in free cash flows. We have also been focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As we previously communicated, we paid down $265 million of debt in the first fiscal quarter. Our net leverage ratio declined to 2.5 times as of December 31, 2020, from 3.0 times at the end of September 2020. A few weeks ago, Moody's upgraded our credit to an investment grade rating, and we are committed to maintaining a full investment grade credit rating across the major credit rating agencies. We believe we are approaching a turning point in our capital allocation. In the past, a significant amount of our cash was dedicated to repaying the debt. But looking ahead, we expect to have greater flexibility to refocus our cash deployment on growth opportunities, including tuck-in M&A and other capital deployment options. Next, I want to address fiscal 2021 guidance. While we observed greater resiliency in Q1 as it relates to procedure volumes, we still view COVID-19 resurgences to be a significant risk factor to our forward outlook as it could impact general health care utilization, procedure volumes and diagnostic testing, including COVID testing. In the latter weeks of December, as the resurgence has picked up, we started to see pressure on some of our procedure based products. This trend continued into January. We have updated our guidance to incorporate some impact from the resurgence into our forecast for fiscal Q2, and we continue to monitor the trends. Our guidance continues to assume no major system-wide shutdowns of elective procedures. Now given the strength of our Q1 performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are comfortable forecasting FX-neutral revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% compared to our prior range of high single to low double-digits. This would include our assumption of Veritor revenues being towards the high end of our original guidance range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Using current exchange rates, we expect FX to add approximately 200 basis points to revenue growth versus our prior year guidance of about 100 basis points. We expect our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.85, which is above our prior guidance range of $12.40 to $12.60, a raise of $0.30 at the midpoint of the range. So for these reasons, while we are extremely pleased with our strong execution in fiscal Q1, we want to caution against extrapolating our fiscal Q1 revenue, margin and EPS performance going forward. While we are not giving quarterly guidance, we thought it might be helpful to provide some context on this quarter's strength as you contemplate phasing for the rest of the year. Our Q1 revenues, operating margins and adjusted EPS are likely to be the highest absolute levels for the year due to two factors: Veritor pricing and the ramp of our planned investment spending. In addition, the stocking of $100 million will unwind in the remainder of the year. As Tom mentioned, we expect Veritor revenues in fiscal Q2 to be lower than Q1. As we have discussed in the past, we expected our COVID test pricing to decline, and this is playing out. We expect Veritor to be well positioned for broad access as we look ahead. Regarding our operating margins, our fiscal Q1 EPS benefited from the higher Veritor revenues and margin profile as well as the timing of investment spending. We expect investment spending, particularly in R&D, to be meaningfully stepped up in Q2. The combination of these two factors will result in our operating margins moving into the low to mid-20s in our fiscal Q2. In the second half of the year, given our expectations for lower Veritor revenues and for investment spending to continue to ramp at a similar rate to fiscal Q2, we would expect operating margins in the low 20s. We are also seeing some impact from the resurgence in January. And like many others, we are also continuing to see pressure from higher shipping costs as well as some other headwinds. However, due to the strength of our Q1 results, we are able to offset these headwinds and raise our full year EPS guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Christian, who will help moderate our Q&A. Sure, David. Thanks for the question. And I would say, first of all, it is early in the year, obviously. So we are raising - but some of the factors that you mentioned we do see playing out in the remainder of the year. So we had a few things going on. Obviously, we mentioned that Veritor, we would expect that revenue to come down in the remainder of the year and moderate, as we talked about. We also had timing in the base business that we would expect to moderate. And to your point, we do expect the investment spending both in the Veritor reinvestment program that we have discussed as well as R&D and quality to ramp. So we started those programs in Q1. We watch that spending with some prudence as we looked at the pandemic playing out. And so we got started, but the ramp really comes in the second, third and fourth quarter. And so when you put all of that into context, you also have to take into consideration a little bit of impact from the resurgence that we saw that we mentioned we have playing out in Q2. So with all of those factors coming into play, we felt that it was prudent to think about the guidance that we gave as appropriate at this point. So yes, obviously, we are not going to go through 2022 with any level of precision, but I think it is important to give some high-level comments on it. And as Tom mentioned, the level of COVID testing is a variable that will have a big impact on 2022. We do see the sustainability of testing, but at what level, it is really hard to guess at this point. In addition, there is a lot of other uncertainty around COVID in general, the resurgences, mutations, the uptake of the vaccines. And in our business, obviously, Alaris and when that comes back in 2022 will have an impact. I would remind you that on our November call we said we expected our revenues, excluding COVID diagnostic testing and the Alaris pump revenues, to grow in mid-single digits on an FX-neutral basis. And we continue to see that as a reasonable assumption. We can't predict when the FDA clearance for Alaris and our focus on making a comprehensive filing to support a timely approval is there, but we would expect some clearance sometime in fiscal 2022. We would also not look at the second half of 2021 as a proxy of what to expect in 2022 because both the gross and operating margins are impacted by several factors. Our operating margin in fiscal 2021 reflects these incremental investments we are making as part of the investment program of Veritor that really helps drive durable growth aligned with our 2025 strategy. And we don't expect those investments to continue into 2022, so exiting 2021, they'll roll off and that should help margins going into 2022. The other thing I would point out is that Q1 fiscal 2022 will obviously be the most difficult comp from a margin perspective, given the very strong quarter we just reported. For example, most likely face the most difficult comparison with COVID revenues as well as from the impact of the timing and stocking that we talked about. So we would expect our operating margin to compress year-over-year from the 31.6% that we just achieved. So we will update you more on our thoughts on 2022 as we progress through the year, but we just thought it is important to provide some of those highlights. Yes. I think one way to think about that is what I mentioned about 2022 is that we expect the base business to be ramping at a mid-single digits. So that is consistent with that. So I think that we feel the underlying business is solidly in that kind of perspective and as we talked about the base business, we expect to be kind of in that low to mid-single-digit level for the full year. And so there is some pressures in the second half of the year on a business-by-business basis. As you think about MMS, there will be some issues. It is going to be lumpy in the remaining quarters. MMS had a significant amount of revenue in the third quarter during the pandemic last year. Other parts of the business will ramp nicely. China, for example, as we lap the COVID impact that really was in Q2 there in China, so we will start seeing some revenue growth from that. But again, that is more of a compare. It is not an indication of the underlying business. But the underlying business really is in that low to mid-single-digit basis. We have some general issues with compared to the - based on the Alaris ship hold. Some of that has been negated by medical necessity. So there is a number of factors going on. But the bottom line of it all is think about the base business, for the remainder of this year in that low to mid-single-digits and exiting into 2022 in the mid-single-digit basis. Sure. Absolutely. And I would just say a few things first. We were very proud of the fact that we really focused on cash during the pandemic. And if you look back, in fact, at the third quarter of last year, our cash flow actually increased year-over-year despite the fact that the revenues were suppressed from COVID. And that was the result of a number of actions that we took in the business around inventories, receivables, payables. And so we are very proud of that. We are really focused on cash. As we mentioned at your conference last month, Robbie, we paid down $265 million of debt. That kind of gets us down to the target. So we see the leverage ratio floating down naturally without the need to pay down debt, which really says that the $5 billion-ish that we have paid down debt over the last couple of years, that strong cash flow that we are generating will be available to allocate to other value enhancements. So we have talked about primarily the tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. And as we get through this pandemic and as that safety net of cash that we have had to ride out the pandemic isn't as necessary, we will have the ability towards the end of this year. And you have seen our tuck-in M&A ramping up, the pipeline is good. We continue to look at a number of opportunities. And by the end of this year, I think we will be also talking about giving that cash back to shareholders. Because once we get through this period, we don't see the need to build up cash on the balance sheet. And so we would be returning that to shareholders after a certain amount of tuck-in M&As. So this puts us in a very good position. We have got great cash flow generation and better than ever, and that puts us in a great position to allocate that appropriately. I think that recognition also came from Moody's. We felt really good about the fact that they upgraded us to investment grade. In fact, not only did they upgrade us, but they kept the positive outlook, which we really appreciated as well. And so that puts us full investment grade across all three rating agencies, and we fully intend to stay that way Kristen Stewart Thanks for the question. Operator. Sure. On margins, Vijay, Q1 margins were obviously very, very strong. And that was a function of a very, very strong. And that was a function of a number of things. First, the COVID testing, obviously. But the base business was very, very strong as well. And we drove some synergy and continuous improvement kind of margin improvements as well. So all things were positive in Q1. As we think about the rest of the year, you would year, you would expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model expect that COVID testing to moderate as you model that out, obviously. And then don't forget you also have the unwind of the timing that we saw of the $100 million in Q1. That unwinds in the remainder of the year. But the most important thing is the ramping of investments that we have discussed. So we are investing in R&D. We are investing in quality. We are investing in the Veritor reinvestment program. And all of those things kind of ramp in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so don't think about that as an indication of our pre-pandemic margins. It is just completely different. And then those investments go away into 2022. The beauty of it is they begin to drive improvements in growth, in revenue generation, in margin expansion, and those things will kick in towards the latter half of FY 2022. So you get the pickup in margins by them going away and then the benefit of those investments in driving revenue growth and margin improvement going forward. So you can't look at that as - those are different than pre-pandemic margins. So that is the way to think benefit of those investments in driving revenue benefit of those investments in driving revenue about 2021 as it plays out. Thanks, everyone."

I would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines terms you will hear today, such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results excluding estimated COVID-only testing. With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm extremely proud of our organization and our performance this year. We closed the year with excellent momentum, having delivered strong and consistent growth in our base business. For the full fiscal year, we exceeded our revenue and earnings guidance and achieved our margin expansion goal. Our performance this year confirms BD 2025 is the right strategy and it's working. Our results reflect our strategy in action and the focused execution and dedication of our global teams who reliably served our customers, controlled costs and increased productivity during a challenging environment. At Investor Day in November 2021, we outlined our plan to build sustained shareholder value creation in five key focus areas. Today, I'm pleased to review the progress we've made to achieve this plan. First, we delivered consistent performance and durably strengthened our growth profile. Our FY '22 results are on track with our long-range targets to deliver 5.5 plus top line and double-digit EPS growth with operating margin improvement back toward our pre-pandemic level. In FY '22, we drove 9.4% revenue growth in our base business. Additionally, we achieved our margin expansion goals in an increasing inflationary environment by both leveraging our revenue performance and realizing savings and efficiencies from several of our multiyear simplification and cost improvement initiatives. As a result, we delivered $11.35 in adjusted diluted EPS.  Second, we continue to reshape our portfolio by advancing our innovation pipeline and M&A strategy towards higher-growth markets. In FY '22, we continued to transform our innovation pipeline with about 60% of our new product development invested in three market spaces that are reshaping healthcare and helping to fuel our growth: smart, connected care; enabling new care settings; and improving chronic disease outcomes. We believe our current pipeline is the most exciting in the history of the company. In addition, we deployed over $2 billion this year towards six tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were allocated towards higher growth markets. This includes Parata Systems, our largest acquisition since Bard, which is aligned to our focus on smart, connected care and enabling new care settings. Parata makes BD the global leader in the fast-growing pharmacy automation market and enables us to provide solutions to help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages. With today's transformative solutions from pharmacy automation to biotech drug delivery devices, to high-throughput molecular diagnostic systems and new dies and instruments for immuno-oncology and multi-omics research to at-home solutions for urinary incontinence, we are systematically creating a new wave of future growth for BD. Third, we executed our simplification programs and managed our cost structure. Like every other company, we face tremendous inflationary pressure. We saw the pressure coming early on, and we took action immediately putting in place an inflation task force to attack it from every side. We also prioritized our internal cost reduction programs and significantly leveraged our selling and G&A expense, driving strong operating leverage. In addition, we actively managed our portfolio, including spinning Embecta, as well as exiting more than 2,500 SKUs as we accelerated our Project RECODE initiative to simplify our portfolio and exit products that add complexity in our plant. A leaner portfolio and less complex manufacturing processes allowed us to improve output with the same fixed cost base and optimize our mix to produce more of the products most critical to our customers. We furthered our investments in what matters to our customers, strengthening our supply chain, validating secondary suppliers and building key component inventory all factors that have been even more important in a supply-constrained environment. And finally, as we drove strong revenue growth beyond our original expectations, we leveraged our scale and excellence in manufacturing as volumes in our plants recovered from FY '20 and '21 lows due to COVID disruptions and procedures. As a result, in FY '22, we were able to absorb significant increases in inflation during the year and improved our margin profile back towards BD's pre-pandemic levels of 25% in FY '25.  Fourth, we maintained a disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. Over the last few years, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and improved flexibility. This has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support growth-enhancing investments in capital R&D and tuck-in M&A. We're now at 2.8x net leverage, and both Moody's and Fitch upgraded our debt this year, reflecting the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment. Also, this framework gave us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We just announced our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. And finally, our strong teams continue to execute and create value even during uncertain times. Our execution in FY '22 is a testament to our growth mindset at BD, where we firmly believe there's nothing we can't do, only things we haven't done yet. And by navigating successfully the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to consistently deliver strong performance. These capabilities are now all embedded in our operating principles and with the strong execution abilities across our network. They're having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability. In summary, these proof points reflect how BD 2025 and the actions we've taken in FY '22 and over the past several years, uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong and consistent results.  I'll now provide more detail on the progress we made this year on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. In FY '22, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 25 key new products. We are on track to achieve our new product revenue contribution as outlined at Investor Day and are increasing our portfolio weighting in attractive, faster-growing markets. Our product launches reinforce our leadership position in our durable core and expand our offering in higher-growth spaces across smart, connected care, enabling new care settings and improving outcomes for chronic disease. These launches strengthened our position in strategic areas such as medication safety, immunology research reagents, molecular and point-of-care diagnostics, peripheral vascular disease and incontinence. Examples include PosiFlush SafeScrub, our next-generation flush product; Prevue, our peripheral vascular access system; BD COR, our fully automated high throughput molecular system and related women's health and STI assays; and the PureWick Male External Catheter. I'm excited by the progress we've made advancing our innovation-driven growth strategy and the strides we've made to improve outcomes for patients and providers and create value for our stakeholders. I'll now share a few updates on the progress our team made this year to advance our ESG strategy and goals. Together We Advance serves as a framework for our ESG strategy. In July, we published our 2021 ESG report, which provides details about our ESG strategy and progress against our 2030 commitments. Highlights include the launch of the BD Sustainable Medical Technology Institute, efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emission, including joining the UN race to zero and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy. Just last month, BD in Sandy, Utah was awarded the Blue Sky Legacy Award for making significant strides towards Utah's environmental sustainability. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact on our communities. We also made progress on our workforce IDE goals, ending FY '22 with increased diversity at the executive and management levels, and we remain committed to having an inclusive workplace. We're proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we were named to Forbes 2022 list of the world's best employers, a recognition of BD as a great place for the world's best talent to work as part of a healthy and inclusive community. Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look forward to FY '23, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD 2025 as we move toward the second half of our strategic plan period.  Starting with the macro environment. Our BD 2025 strategy and the capabilities we have built over the past two years position us well to navigate what we expect to be some persistent macro challenges and uncertainty facing all companies. We reiterate our conviction in the three irreversible forces shaping health care and our strategy to address them. For example, as it relates to smart, connected care, there's an increasing need for digitalization and automation of healthcare processes as providers look for ways to increase efficiency and address labor and inflationary challenges. Regarding inflation and supply chain, our perspective continues to be that challenges are going to persist, not escalate at least through 2023. And although inflation could potentially start easing somewhat, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically. Companies that have processes, systems and capabilities to navigate this environment will continue to thrive over the next couple of years. And as we move forward, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of BD 2025, which will continue to serve as our true north. This includes delivering impactful innovations for our customers by expanding our leadership positions in our durable core and continuing to invest to expand our portfolio in the higher growth areas that are transforming healthcare. In addition, Alaris remains our #1 priority, and we're making good progress. While we don't comment on the status of the review or approval timing, we are taking all the steps necessary to provide the required regulatory information and support our customers upon clearance. We will also continue our investments to increase manufacturing capacity, strengthen our supply chain and increase supplier redundancy to help ensure we continue to reliably supply our products for our customers. We will continue to focus on initiatives to return our margin profile to FY '19 pre-pandemic levels in FY '25. This includes accelerating initiatives like Project RECODE, including our efforts around operating model simplification, resulting in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization. We expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. Our priorities include investing in our business through R&D and CapEx. After investing organically and returning value through dividends, we will continue to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and return value to shareholders through share repurchases. And we expect to continue to stay ahead of the curve as we navigate the macro environment, leveraging the capabilities we have built that are now embedded in our operating principles. We recently celebrated BD's 125th year anniversary as a company, demonstrating our durable model underpinned by our tradition of relentless focus on innovation and operational excellence. We're really excited about what the future holds. And with the performance of our global teams, we'll continue to grow our impact on customers and patients and advance the world of health.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year which reflects our growth strategy playing out as planned. Through execution of our BD 2025 strategy, we are fulfilling our short-term commitments while progressing towards our long-term goals. Beginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our revenue growth expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. We delivered $4.8 billion in revenue in Q4, with base business growth of 8.6% or 6.8% organic. Parata contributed about 140 basis points to growth in the quarter and about 40 basis points to the full year. COVID-only testing revenues were $37 million, which is expected decline from $316 million last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $18.9 billion in revenue with base business growth of 9.4% and or 8.5% organic. COVID-only testing revenues were $511 million, which, as expected, declined from $2 billion last year.  Total company base business growth was strong across all three segments with double-digit growth in BD Life Sciences and high single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in EMEA. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 20 basis points for the full year.  Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 10.2% with strong performance across the segment. Growth was driven by strong growth in MDS of 8%, driven by continued execution of our comprehensive vascular access management strategy; MMS growth of 11.5%, driven by strong demand of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation strategies, including our recent acquisition of Parata as customers focus on automation to drive efficiency to help address the constrained labor market, and another quarter of double-digit growth of 12.8% in Pharmaceutical Systems based on our strong leadership position in prefillable solutions for biologics and vaccines. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The decline of 11.6% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 8.3% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences. Base business growth was driven by IDS growth of 8.6%, enabled by continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD MAX installed base and continued demand for our leading clinical microbiology and specimen management platforms. And lastly, BDB growth of 7.5%, driven by continued demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry instruments as researchers are able to do even higher parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions.  BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 5.7%. Growth was driven by surgery growth of 5.4% and supported by our Advanced Repair and Reconstruction portfolio with strong market adoption of our leading Phasix hernia products. PI growth of 4.8%, which reflects continued expansion of our venous portfolio highlighted by Venclose in the U.S. and the global relaunch of Venovo. PI performance also reflects increased back orders primarily related to a BDI specific European ERP system implementation. Urology growth of 7.2% reflects continued strong demand for our PureWick Female incontinence solutions in both acute and alternative care settings. Now moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.75 increased 28%. Base business gross margin of 52.5% was up 80 basis points and base operating margin of 22.5% was up 430 basis points year-over-year. Full year adjusted diluted EPS of $11.35 grew 0.6%. As we anticipated, we made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals despite increasing inflation pressures. For the full year, base business gross margin of 53.4% was up 110 basis points and base operating margin of 22.4% was up 280 basis points. The key full year drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flowed through sales this year.  Base operating margin reflects strong operating expense leverage with base selling and G&A as a percent of sales, leveraging by 180 basis points, partially offset by significant inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping. To put this in perspective, shipping expense increased at a double-digit rate in our base business. This increase in shipping was offset with focused efforts on cost management and leverage of selling and G&A which only grew at about 1/3 the rate of sales and was the primary driver of 21% currency-neutral growth in base operating income. This is a testament to the tremendous work by our organization to mitigate inflation and execute our margin enhancement initiatives. This was also a key enabler in supporting continued investment in R&D at just over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $2.5 billion in FY '22. Operating cash flow reflects a higher inventory balance of about $600 million year-over-year. The increase reflects the impact of inflation, longer in-transit lead times and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand. As expected, our free cash flow conversion this year was below our long-term target. We remain very focused on cash flow conversion and we are taking actions to moderate inventory down. But in the short term, we believe it's a prudent trade-off to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy and supply chain constraints normalize, we expect to migrate towards our long-term cash conversion target.  In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested over $2 billion in six tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2023 and beyond. Beyond our investments in growth, consistent with what we shared regarding the planned use of Embecta proceeds, we paid down $500 million in long-term debt this fiscal year and returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Moving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Our FY '23 guidance aligns with the framework we communicated last quarter and the value creation model and long-term targets we outlined at our Investor Day to deliver 5.5% plus base revenue growth, continued margin improvement and double-digit base earnings growth on a currency-neutral basis. As a reminder, we manage our business on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance, consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar. Beyond that change, our guidance has only strengthened in a complex macro environment, where we continue to see elevated inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.  Starting with revenues. I'll provide you some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect base revenues to grow 5.25% to 6.25%, which is a strong growth of 5.75% at the midpoint. This midpoint is above our 5.5% plus target we outlined during our Investor Day, given the confidence we have in our strengthening growth profile. Our revenue guidance includes two proactive strategic portfolio management actions that are consistent with our BD 2025 strategy and support our value creation goals. First, building on our FY '22 achievements. Our base revenue guidance includes planned strategic portfolio exits as part of the acceleration of our portfolio simplification and RECODE programs. These actions will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter the most to our customers. We expect these actions to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin. Second, offsetting this revenue impact is a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions with Parata being the predominant driver. We will continue to be active in portfolio management as a lever to create value for all stakeholders. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to achieve our long-range plan commitments, and we are assuming strong performance across the segments in FY '23. And we expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comparisons and Interventional to be at the high end of the range. Consistent with what we shared, we expect COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings to be at a level significantly below FY '22, with revenues more in line with the annualization of our Q4 FY '22 results or approximately $125 million to $175 million for the full year.  Regarding Alaris, consistent with what we've done in the past, we are only modeling shipments related to medical necessity. While we will be prepared when clearance is received, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp to revenues upon clearance.  Regarding our assumptions on earnings. We expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points over the 22.6% reported in FY '22. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving pre-pandemic operating margin levels of about 25% and in FY '25. First, to give you some color on inflationary assumptions. As a reminder, outsized inflation in FY '22 was a headwind of over 200 basis points we expect a similar level of incremental outsized inflation in FY '23. The primary drivers of the incremental inflation are raw material costs and labor, which are about equally weighted. Even though we see some signs of cost normalizing in certain areas, a lot of the outsized inflation is from inventory we manufactured in FY '22 as there's about a four to six-month lag from production to sell-through. Labor costs, especially in our manufacturing plants, have continued to increase. We have taken proactive actions to ensure we are differentiating BD to retain our skilled workforce. Lastly, transportation costs have stabilized, and we've begun to see some downward movement on certain rates. However, we are still above more normalized levels. We remain committed to leading through the macro complexity while making investments to support our customers to offset these inflationary impacts we continue to leverage our strong growth profile and drive outsized cost reduction and other mitigation programs. We expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A driven by internal cost containment and leveraging. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales. Our simplification initiatives include continuing to execute on Project RECODE. You will recall when we announced RECODE, it was intended to deliver $300 million in savings by the end of fiscal year '24, with portfolio and network optimization representing about 70% of the savings. We are accelerating these efforts and are also making significant progress with the third pillar of RECODE, operating model simplification, which will result in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization. In addition, to provide some color below operating income, we expect an increase of approximately $50 million to $75 million in interest/other. This is primarily driven by increased pension expense, which we fully covered in our guidance, and is a result of the negative movement in the financial markets. For tax, based on what we know today, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13.5% and 14.5%. It would not be unusual for our rate to fluctuate above or below this range on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Our guidance assumes no material change in average common shares outstanding from our average FY '22 share balance. This takes into account the conversion of all outstanding preferred shares on June 1, 2023, the benefit from the FY '22 share repurchase and associated with the use of the impacted distribution and our commitment to mitigate the dilution from share-based compensation. So on an all-in basis, we expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 300 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing; and as a result, implies a very strong low teens base earnings growth of approximately 12% to 14%. Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in August, the U.S. dollar strengthened against all major currencies. Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 450 basis points or about $850 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This currency headwind has nearly doubled since our August call. Our guidance assumes the euro at 0.99, which is down about 4% since August. The Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian dollar have also all declined even more than the euro since August by almost 2x the euro movement. For context, these four currencies combined are in line with our total euro exposure. The currency headwind to EPS growth has also nearly doubled since our August earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 420 basis points to adjusted EPS growth. All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $11.85 and to $12.10. As you think of fiscal '23 phasing, there are three key items to consider. First, FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue will be over-indexed to the first half. For the full year, we expect the drop-through to earnings to be below our BDX operating margin. Due to the expected benefit from inventory flow-through in Q1, the drop-through is expected to start well below the full year average and most significantly impact the second and third quarters. Second is the grow-over impact of COVID-related dynamics. As a reminder, in FY '22, almost 80% of COVID-only testing revenue was realized in the first half of the year, with strong margin drop-through as reinvestment was weighted to the latter part of the year. In addition, there is also a comp to strong first half performance in FY '22 related to combo testing in the base business.  And the third is inflation. Nearly 40% of the full year inflation headwind is expected to occur in Q1 as we sell through inventory manufactured in FY '22 in the first half of the year.  As a result of these items, as you think of the progression of our total operating margin expansion through the year, for Q1, you should expect a year-over-year decline driven primarily by the year-over-year comparison of higher COVID-only testing. We expect operating expansion to ramp over the remainder of the year with the majority occurring in the second half. As a reminder, there are some tough comparisons to the prior year in Q1, such as the benefit of about $50 million in licensing revenues in Life Sciences. As a result of these dynamics, we expect Q1 base revenue growth and adjusted EPS to be under-indexed relative to an equal quarterly phasing of the full year. So this guide, coupled with our FY '22 results, has us progressing very well towards our FY '25 goals, including a two-year revenue CAGR assuming the FY '23 midpoint of 5.75% that is well above the 5.5% plus target at around 7.5%, achievement of nearly 400 basis points of margin improvement or over 70% of the way towards our FY '25 objective and two consecutive years of strong double-digit adjusted earnings growth in our base business.  In closing, we are very pleased with our performance, particularly given the macro complexity and inflationary pressure we navigated. The consistent execution we delivered and our ability to mitigate these challenges through FY '22 enabled our results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders. With that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments.\nThomas Polen : Thanks, Chris. Our BD 2025 strategy is demonstrating strong momentum and performance positioning BD to be increasingly well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders and successfully navigate and differentiate in today's challenging environment. . I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health. And before I turn it to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Mike and Rick to their new roles, leading the Medical and Interventional segments, respectively. Both Mike and Rick are highly effective leaders who have demonstrated strategic and operational excellence, and they're nearly two decades at BD. Their focus on driving growth and meaningful outcomes has been critical as we pursue our BD 2025 strategy, and they are well-rounded seasoned leaders with a track record of developing strong teams that deliver impactful results. Their broad experiences across multiple BD businesses and segments position them well for their new roles as we advance our growth agenda and build BD's future. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?\nOperator: Certainly. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen : Congratulations on a strong finish to the year. First for Chris on the top line guidance. It implies only about 4.75%, excluding Parata and testing. You just grew 6.8% organic in Q4, 8.5% for the full year. So why the deceleration in fiscal 2023? It seems conservative given the momentum. And can you talk about assumptions for pricing and those divestitures? And I have 1 follow-up.\nChristopher DelOrefice : Yes. Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with our growth rate. As you noted, I think what we're delivering is a testament to our strategy playing out, delivering consistent growth in both our durable core balanced with acceleration through transformative solutions, coupled with the actually organic contribution from the tuck-in M&A that we're starting to see as we anniversary acquisitions more than a year. There's about a 20 basis point contribution to growth.  So as you noted, 9.4 this year, really strong year, in a year by the way where we actually had an increasing complex environment. Our ability to grow double digits in China as an example with some of the dynamics we saw play out there, 8.5% organic. I think there's a few things that I think will give you some color to kind of understand. Our underlying growth rate remains extremely strong as it relates to our '23 guide. If you think of it as a two-year period at 7.5% growth over a two-year period comping over that 9.4%, this is well above our 5.5-plus even if you adjust out, from an inorganic standpoint, the growth is still at about 7%. So we -- I also think it's a strong indication that we're actually consistently delivering this growth. On the strategic portfolio exits, let me give some color on that. This is a bit different. It's certainly consistent with our simplification strategies. And really, it's the strength of our underlying business and the strong growth outlook that allows us to take these strategic bold actions to create value for our customers and our shareholders. These are the kind of things that investors should want us to do, and we're very fortunate to be able to take this opportunity. It's consistent with our relentless focus on portfolio. And what we're essentially doing different from SKU rationalization, which is really simplifying the SKUs that we go to market with, that require work, investment, reregistrations, et cetera. These are pure portfolio exits. You almost need to think of them. It's a onetime kind of divestiture as we took a step back, looked at our portfolio, trying to understand where we could best create value, again, both through the lens of our customer and through the lens of our investors. So these are areas, for example, that would fit a typical divestiture growth profile. These are not accretive to growth. These are significantly dilutive to margin, in many cases, well below half our existing margin rate and the right thing to do. I'd also point to the fact that while these were dilutive to margin, they did actually benefit our earnings. And so we had absorbed that in a very strong earnings guide, right, when you think of our bottom line of 9% to 11% double digits at the midpoint on an FX-neutral basis. And that's on an all-in comping over the COVID-only lost revenue year-over-year. And so adjusting for that, we still delivered about 12% to 14% of base earnings growth. So we think this is the right thing to do for the long term. It's the right thing to do. Our underlying business, I actually think it's fair to think of that 1% impact roughly differently, almost like an inorganic adjustment because the rest of our portfolio continues to perform strong. As a matter of fact, we -- if you look at the 5.75, it's above the 5.5 midpoint. And then I'll go back to the two year, which is, again, on an organic basis, over 7%. So hopefully, that helps kind of explain that part of the guide. We feel great about our revenue and certainly feel good about the bottom line.\nLawrence Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And just, Tom, one follow-up. It's been about -- the comments on Alaris were encouraging in your prepared remarks. It's been about 1.5 years since you filed. What can you share about the review process? And are you still confident you can bring Alaris back before 2025 since I think the BD '25 margin target assumes about 80 basis points contribution from Alaris.\nThomas Polen : Larry, as always, great to connect, and thanks for that question. So as we've mentioned on several occasions, getting Alaris back on the market is our #1 priority. We remain confident in the resources we've invested in our submission in the team and a leadership task to prioritize this in our process and we are confident that we will get clearance. What we also want to be -- continue to be prudent on Larry and thoughtful about the process with the FDA. And so therefore, that's why we're not predicting time lines given how inherently complex those submissions are -- as you said and as we've shared in the past, the relaunch of Alaris is included within our strategic plan as we provided at Investor Day, and there is no change to that. We just -- as I mentioned before, we want to not predict those time lines, but we are prepared for launch when that clearance comes so that we can best support our customers. And as you know, we did launch Alaris -- the new Alaris pump in Canada this past year, and we're getting very positive feedback from customers there. So thank you for the question. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: One, Chris, maybe I want to start with guidance and I had one for Tom. On the guidance, what -- I guess, what are you assuming for vaccine? I think vaccines were $150 million-ish of contribution in fiscal '22. Is that zero? Is that a headwind? And Alaris emergency use, is that similar to fiscal '22? Is that below? And related to that, I think in the past, you've said active discussions with the FDA, has that changed in active discussions with the FDA relative to Alaris?\nThomas Polen : This is Tom. So no, we continue to have active discussions with the FDA on Alaris. And as I mentioned, things are progressing towards our process, and we'll obviously give an update when we get ultimately clearance on that, but we don't want to try to predict the timing on that. And so therefore, again, as we have been being prudent, we haven't reflected that in our guidance specific approval timing. So we do have the same run rate of medical necessity in our guidance, which is about $100 million, same as '22. We've carried that forward into '23. And to your question on vaccines, it is a headwind in '23 that we're jumping over there. There's relatively limited vaccination demand ongoing for COVID. And so that's definitely a headwind that we're jumping over in MDS, but we have that covered.\nVijay Kumar : Understood. And Tom, sorry, can you quantify what the headwind is? And related to that, sorry, my second question here. Parata, it looks like your pro forma organic here was really strong, perhaps in the teens. Maybe talk about what's driving this strong contribution from Parata. And is that part of your revenue synergies as part as the deal?\nThomas Polen : Yes, VJ. So on the hypo, we won't share the specific number there. But it is a -- there's very limited revenue, vaccine-related in hypo that we have planned for '23. Related to Parata, you're right. We have very strong performance in Parata at/or slightly ahead of our deal model on that. So we're off to a great start, and we're seeing really strong demand. And let me turn it over to Mike Garrison here, who, of course, led that acquisition when he was leading MMS and now continues to be over that as is leading the Medical segment. So Mike?\nMike Garrison: Hi, Vijay, thanks for the question on product. Parata, yes, we're very excited about Parata, also the MedKeeper, the Medbank acquisitions that are in the portfolio. They are just great teams with a passion for their craft. And it may be the things that are differentiating it in our approach, the extensive diligence we did prior to the acquisition, a real focus on culture in the first 30 days of working with the teams. And then we also set up an integration management office within MMS with some of our senior leaders to really guide and focus on each individual work stream across the functions to make sure that the acquisition goes well out of the gate. But I think the main thing is the value proposition is very strong and clear for Parata. It directly addresses the labor shortages and the clinical efficiencies that customers are seeking, especially right now, and as well as their long-term goals around smart, connected care, data-driven decision making, things like that. So it both addresses short-term needs and long-term needs, and that's why customers are reacting so favorably to it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus : Great. Maybe to follow up on some of the '23 guidance questions. I was wondering if you could help us with some detail maybe around what you're assuming for the COVID flu combo tests. We're off to the worst start of flu in over a decade. So what you're assuming in there or just for flu in fiscal '23? And remind us where those tests ended up on sales in fiscal '22? And also, how do we think about Parata down the P&L? It's 100 bps on the top line. Just remind us of what you're assuming on the bottom line for that.\nChristopher DelOrefice : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Appreciate it. Yes, I can take the Parata question as it relates to the margin, and then either Dave and/or Tom can maybe talk about COVID flu, how we're thinking about it. Parata, what we've shared publicly is it was immediately accretive to BD. We weren't specific with the amount. But actually, we did say it's actually even accretive to our long-range outlook, which is think of it as that about 25% from an operating margin. So it is certainly a positive contributor on the bottom line. I will just reinforce, remember, as you think of our total all in. So Parata, I think, is a great example of adding a strategic asset with a strong growth profile, strong accretion on the margin standpoint. We did have to jump over the COVID-only, which was a $300 million-plus drag on the top line that also had a higher, slightly higher margin profile. So I think when you look at our total guide at 9% to 11%, that's very strong, and we kind of reversed into the math we had shared that the COVID-only was about 300 basis points headwind in total. It implies a 12% to 14% base earnings growth profile. This is really strong, well, very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, especially again in an inflationary environment, where we're going to have similar levels of inflation year-over-year.\nThomas Polen : Robbie, this is Tom. Good to connect this morning. We've got Dave on the call down in -- with our Latin America team at their kickoff meeting. But I'll tag Dave into the conversation here in just a moment. But related to flu combo. So we are in our assumptions, we do have that moderating a bit versus this past year, where we saw a lot of demand for the flu COVID combo driven by COVID. To your point, there is a potential. We don't see it as significant of a demand driven by the COVID side of the combo test necessarily as we look going forward in '23. Certainly, there can be a greater potential for the flu side demand and differentiating between flu and COVID. I think as you said, it's off to an early start, the flu season, still to be determined the scale of it. In Australia, we saw an early start to the season, but we saw a very narrow onetime peak in that demand. And so actually, the area under the curve was less than normal. And so there was a severe very short flu season in Australia that did not end up creating significant demand and testing because it was such a short duration still to be determined how that rolls out in the U.S., and so we want to be prudent upfront. Maybe Dave, I'll turn it to you to share some more comment here.\nDave Hickey: Yes. Thanks, Tom. And Robbie, thanks for the question. And just as I get into answering that, I just, given this is my first chance on the Q&A here, I do want to just recognize and thank the Life Sciences team globally and all the associates for another outstanding year in fiscal '22. I mean you saw the quarter growth of over 8% there, a record base growth of 13.8% for the year. So Life Sciences continues to be strong. On flu respiratory, I'll just build upon what Tom has said is, if you think about it pre-pandemic, we were always in this range right of the $75 million to $100 million, we were considering the normal flu season. I think also to remember that, that was on Veritor only. We have not really anticipated or seen a normal flu season during the pandemic at all. Definitely in October, we are seeing more visits to urgent care centers and things on influenza-like illness. But again, when you look at it, we think the season has started, it's about eight to nine weeks early. It peaked very quickly in Australia. So it's a little bit early to call what it would look like. I think if we were looking at the range for this year, based on just leverage of the Veritor installed base, we would expect that sort of that flu range of that Veritor base to be about 130 million to 150 million.\nRobert Marcus : Great. Really helpful. And maybe a follow-up. Chris and Tom, 100 bps margin expansion is really healthy, given all the headwinds. Maybe you gave some good color on the slides, but was hoping for maybe just a little more details on how do we think about inflation and raw materials costs? Or any of those other headwinds? If you could put any frameworks around -- and then how do we think about FX on the operating margin line as a negative?\nChristopher DelOrefice : Yes, Robbie. Thanks. So yes, as it relates to 100 basis points, as you noted, definitely another strong year of margin enhancement. That would put us about 70% on track to deliver against our FY '25 goal of about 25%. So really strong progress, having delivered almost half of that in the first year.  So not only do we feel good about what we delivered last year, continuing that momentum and driving towards our long-term objectives. Yes, there's a couple of ways to think of it. One, the predominant driver of margin improvement this year is really going to be leveraging our strong growth profile, focused on cost containment more at the operating margin level, in selling and G&A. So that's about 80% plus of that 100 basis points improvement that we're expecting. The balance is really, there's a little bit of moderating R&D back to our 6% goal. We've actually been over-indexed two years in that area. So obviously, like other areas, you'd expect to, without impacting project spend, just leverage your base with a strong growth profile, 6% is a good outcome there. The balance, which is really minor then, is in GP. So GP, you're going to kind of see that's where we're experiencing most of the inflationary impacts. As a matter of fact, you're seeing a little bit of relief in shipping. It's still above historic what we call normal levels. You're seeing some benefit there as well that's playing out mostly in the operating margin side. As it relates to where we're seeing the most inflationary pressures, it's still raw materials. It's shifted a bit more from kind of resins to other materials, such as packaging would be an example. We do have a carryover effect, too, of the inventory that was built in '22. And so a lot of that will hit in the first half of the year. And the other big area where you still continue to say, I would say, escalating pressures is labor. So labor and raw materials is about 50-50 each of what we're realizing in GP. Obviously, we're taking a ton of action within GP probably in this order in terms of how we think of them. not necessarily size, but as we always think of driving cost improvement, one, it starts with our growth profile, outsized volume in our plants, leveraging our plants portfolio, favorable mix to the extent we can drive that outsized cost improvement, again, going back to our plant mindset as it relates to growth mindset and driving more efficiency and then other factors such as price as well would be part of that equation lastly. So that's how we're thinking of inflation this year and what we're doing to mitigate it. And we're very pleased with the progress that we've had year-to-date. As it relates to FX, we gave some color. Certainly, the team can support you through that in more detail. The drop-through from sales to earnings is slightly lower as consistent with what we've shared in the past on a full year basis. You're going to see sort of quarterly phasing dynamics play out differently because you have the nuance of how FX impacts cost and inventory and how that flows through. You got that four to six-month lag. So you'll see a little bit more favorability in the first half, and it normalized to the full year drop-through that we shared by the end.\nThomas Polen : That's great. Maybe just to add to Chris' comment, and it's a good question, Robbie. Back to -- we are facing, as all companies are, serious inflationary pressures, right, that are happening across the industry and all industries. I think just want to call out our plants. They're doing a phenomenal job. The last thing that we look to do in any situation is price. And so as you heard Chris walk through the order of priorities for us, our plants really have risen and almost doubled the level of normal continuous improvement that we've done historically, they've risen to that task and working to offset as much of that cost as possible. The other thing is the action that we talked about earlier around that strategic portfolio exit, as we're bringing in M&A, and we have strong underlying growth, taking this time to evaluate our portfolio and look at where they're nonstrategic products that are diluting our operational effectiveness in our plants that we can get better performance out of our lines, out of our staffing, out of our resource deployment, and take those actions set us up for strength in the long term. We're doing that this year, and that's helping us also have a role in offsetting those inflationary pressures at making us more efficient in our plants and helping make sure that we can deliver the products that matter most that we're focusing our resources on delivering those products that matter most for our customers that are going to be driving value for us and our shareholders long term.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor : So I had two questions. I guess the first one I wanted to ask was, I know you probably won't comment on litigation, but I was hoping you could address some of the ethylene oxide issues from two angles. One is maybe just talk about some of the things that you have done already with the regulatory agencies to work with them to mitigate risk there to improve the plans? And then any commentary you can make on litigation to get investors comfortable with that risk would be helpful.\nThomas Polen : Sure. Good question, Matt, and I appreciate it. So as you know, BD is among the world's largest producers of medical products that are critical for patient care. And our devices and products, they have to meet FDA sterilization standards. And just as background, I think everyone is aware that numerous types of devices and other sensitive medical products, for many of them, EtO is the only type of sterilization that can be used. In fact, about 50% of all medical products across the industry use EtO for sterilization. And the majority of those products that use EtO for sterilization, other sterilization methods will damage the products like radiation or steam or chloride dioxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide, they actually would damage those products. That's why EtO is used. And you wouldn't be able to ensure the required level of sterility given the materials that are used in those products. And so we're very confident in the systems we've been investing in for decades and can say that our sterilization facilities use the best available EtO emissions control technology in the industry. We achieved more than 99.95% destruction of EtO from our stack admissions. And in accordance with the broad FDA challenge, we continue to invest in cycle optimization and EtO technology upgrades, extending outside of our plants now. And so we take the safety of our associates and the communities we're in very seriously and therefore, have a long history of proactively upgrading our emissions control technology supported by continuous investments back to your good question. So if you go all the way back to -- even let's go back to 1997. We proactively upgraded our emissions control equipment in Georgia to thermal oxidizers all the way back then and began routing back then exhaust in Georgia to the primary emissions control equipment. It's something that still isn't necessarily routine across the industry today. We're at the forefront of that. Today, we have programs and procedures in place to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, including EPA, OSHA, state environmental protection agencies, FDA. Our facilities are at least 20x more efficient at removing EtO per cubic meter of air than what's currently required by the Clean Air Act. And we're working with the FDA and other industry leaders to develop, look at new sterilization cycles that could even take emissions down further than what's ever been possible before. Just as it relates to our outstanding litigation, there are no new cases that have been brought since the third quarter, and we have not taken any accrual in connection with any of the outstanding EtO cases. We've gone through a rigorous process internally and externally, and we do intend to vigorously defend any such cases, given our strong position in the way that we operate.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings : Probably two for Chris, just on Alaris. I was hoping to just review just the run rate of Alaris revenues in the U.S. on medical necessity shipments and where premediation or remediation, that revenue run rate sat? And also I want to just think about what you're absorbing on the margin side without -- assuming that Alaris is not going to be back in play in the U.S. in fiscal '23, what was the margin drag in 2022 and that there is a margin drag in '23? And just how you're maintaining the structure of Alaris franchise to be ready for launch once remediation is over and you're able to fully commercialize again?\nChristopher DelOrefice : Yes. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it. Yes. So I'll just -- I'll share some things that we've shared in the past. One, from a total sales point, we had always talked about that business being roughly $400 million is the way to think of it.  From a medical necessity standpoint, we've talked about $100 million per year. That's what we had last year roughly, and we're planning sort of consistently this year. So that gives you that kind of frame as you think of the size. I will remind you when upon clearance, you would expect a gradual ramp over time. We have not shared a specific timeline that's hard to predict. But maybe just to give a little context, some folks have sort of asked like, okay, are we talking less than a year-over-year. It wouldn't be less than a year, it would ramp up over some time frame, probably over a 12-month period that should help you a little bit. But certainly well within our LRP time period. Margin, we haven't shared specifics by year. What we did share, if you go back to the deleveraging that occurred from our FY 2019, there was about an 80 basis point headwind to our margin. And it's -- that largely stays the same, and we'll adjust as the product comes back. If you think of it, we -- one, we made investments in regulatory quality, of course, we maintained our service and field organization. And so as the sales come back, you would get natural leveraging to occur as we've made those investments to continue to support our installed base and customers.\nThomas Polen : And maybe just 1 other thing to add, Josh, is, as Chris mentioned, so we kept our commercial team. We kept our service team, which as we relaunch again, we'll see the positive flow through since those expenses are already on the P&L and the recovery of that. That 80 bps of dilution that we currently have on the P&L. Just on there is a benefit that we're seeing right now is we're seeing very strong demand on other capital areas within MMS, particularly in the Pyxis area, where we're able to utilize some of those additional service capabilities that we have to actually help us in the installs on the Pyxis side, and maybe since we have Mike here today who again was recently leading that business, maybe Mike, if you just want to comment on some of the broader demand we're seeing on the capital side on the MMS.\nMike Garrison: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Even though there's a -- we recognized a tough economic environment, the uncertainty there, we're not experiencing the same degree of capital pressure that maybe have been communicated elsewhere. In fact, we finished Q4 with a record year for bookings, have a strong implementation schedule planned for, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is the strategy continues to resonate with the Connected Med Management Solutions, again, addressing the labor shortages and our ability to flex and implement both with business model, but also these highly skilled service, a lot of ex-nurses, ex-IT people. These are people that our customers are increasingly seeing the value of partnering with us because we can flex to meet their needs. So both of those things, I think, are really helping, and we're getting a lot of utilization out of the infusion side of the business. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan : Just a clarification for me. I think last quarter, you said that you would expect some organic revenue growth around like 5.5-plus percent base growth, not including Parata. At that time, were the strategic electrics included in that number? Or are those new? And if they were included, does that mean that there was a little bit of softness over the last three months versus what you were thinking?\nChristopher DelOrefice : No. I appreciate the question. Yes. No, that hadn't been contemplated at that point. Again, we took a hard look at our portfolio in the spirit of simplification. This is different from our core Recode program that has a different lens. Similar principles, but a very different lens in terms of a pure exit. We really wanted to make sure we were focusing on our organization in higher value-creating areas. And so this was an add. And again, I think there's so many puts and takes across the year. Looking at this two-year metric, however you look at it, 7-plus percent growth on an organic basis is extremely strong. And we think this is an appropriate action to think we could easily put that back in, right? And our base growth would go up by 100 bps, but this is the right thing to do for all stakeholders over the long term. And we'll be creating significant value and has not impacted our bottom line performance at all.\nThomas Polen : And they're onetime in nature?\nMike Garrison: Yes. \nOperator: We'll take our final question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nFrederick Wise : Tom, you highlighted multiple times your focus on -- among other things, on transformative solutions, M&A, the portfolio. And you and Becton's excellent Chief Financial Officer, both highlighted the balance sheet strength as maybe I think the language was new lever right now. What's your sense of urgency on the external technology M&A front? How do you view your current opportunities? And does the collapse in med tech valuations and multiple compression, does that present more opportunities? Just how are you thinking about it?\nThomas Polen : Great question, Rick, and great to connect. So -- and I agree, we have a very strong CFO, by the way, as well, too. But so we do have a very strong funnel, and we continue to be very focused specifically on tuck-in M&A. No change to our strategy there, as we've articulated many times. We're going to continue to focus our M&A as we have over 95% of our M&A to date has been in those transformative solution categories, as you called out, smart, connected care, enabling the shift to new care settings and improving outcomes in chronic disease. We've also shared that expect more Parata like in size tuck-in M&As as we look forward. So it may not be -- we've done 19 in the last 2.5 years, maybe fewer deals going forward, but of larger scale and impact, given the benefits that we have and the execution that the businesses are focused on and the ones that we've done to date. I'd say that the other thing is we're going to continue our very disciplined approach to M&A. Really proud of the team, not just for the deals that we've done, but from the deals that we've walked away from. That's something we've -- we're really pleased with, the work that we've done and how our deals are executing to plan and the return that they're delivering for our shareholders in a meaningful way. And so we're going to keep that discipline as well. But we do see opportunities will continue to be paced and appropriate about it as we go forward and staying very true to advancing our strategy, continuing to move us into those higher-growth markets. And you see us being very active. One of our portfolio management, not only through M&A, but obviously, completing the spin of Inventor earlier this year and some of the very targeted onetime portfolio exits that we shared today that are basically puts and takes with the inorganic growth that we see coming this year.\nFrederick Wise : Yes. And maybe just one final one from me. I thought it would be interesting to hear from Mike and Rick, since you throw them under the bus a little bit by mentioning their names, Mike, in your new role at BD Medical and Rick on the Interventional side, the boss just said growth and meaningful outcomes is a priority. But I'd be curious to hear about your key priorities and when we speak this time next year, what are your priorities for this year? And what should we expect to see over the coming year? We can pretend Tom is not listening.\nMike Garrison: Thanks, Rick. This is Mike. Yes. So the -- my priority is the same as it was in the MMS role, is that getting Alaris back to market. It's a top priority for the company. And so it remains my top priority. Beyond that, a lot of it has to do with making sure that our innovation is productive, that dollars that we're spending in R&D get value out to customers. And because innovation that never makes it to a customer isn't productive at all. I think that constantly creating a culture where we're developing and coaching our talent to be better each day and have a continuous improvement mentality. I think that's really critical, especially in the current environment, the same way that our customers are facing labor pressures, we are, too. And so if we're the best place to work and people feel that they can belong a greater purpose that we provide, I think that's really, really important. And then finally, I think that there's just an approach to leadership that I hope that we have a performance-based culture of commitment. So whenever we make a commitment, we meet the commitment and we keep our mindset around that. So maybe a bit of a lean processes, but in an abundant mindset would be the way that I think about it. And I'm really -- last thing is Rick actually interviewed me and hired me 18 years ago. So everything I have, I owe to Rick. So thanks, Rick.\nRick Byrd: Too kind, Mike, thanks. So Rick, thanks for the question. So as I round out pretty much 60 days in the role, I'm truly inspired by the opportunity that we have in BDI to collectively enhance patient lives. So innovations like PureWick, Phasix, Venovo, just to name a few, are truly life changers for patients. And then also, as I go around the business, the commitment, the capability of the team, from our salesperson, R&D, manufacturing technicians in the plants, doesn't matter. Everyone is really focused on the patient. And so first, as Chris mentioned, and we had a great year, right? BDI grew at 7.1%, which is at the high end of our long-range plan. And again, as we said, our commitment there for next year is right there again. So we're on track for that long-range plan. So my priority is keep driving these innovations, keep meeting our commitments as a segment and continue to have a difference in chronic disease treatment and then on the associates within BD and then all the customers that we serve. So really a great opportunity, and I appreciate the question. Thanks.\nThomas Polen : I think, Rick, maybe just to share one of the other things is, as we said, within the quarter, we saw some backorders in BDI. One of the things that I know, Rick, just you're focusing on helping the team is bringing some of the operational excellence from having led MDS for many years, bringing some of those capabilities from the broader BD operating side into the BDI segment. And maybe just a couple of comments there because that's a big focus. \nRick Byrd: Great. No, I think we have a great opportunity to improve the supply chain to give an example of the ERP system upgrade, finally, bringing in fully integrating BDI into the beauty system as well. These are going to provide efficiencies to hold deliver products to our customers reliably, on time and things like that. So again, I've spent a lot of my time first off in BDI, looking at opportunities that we can continue to streamline things, drive operational effectiveness. Exactly. So thanks, Tom, for that.\nThomas Polen : The great benefits of obviously being able to rotate talent across diverse groups of businesses. And I think Rick's background, as everyone knows, MDS is probably the most operationally heavy business within the company, just given the billions of products we make on syringes and catheters and bringing that where the BDI businesses have been very innovation-driven and growth driven. It's a very nice complementary skill and leadership to be able to bring in those capabilities over. So great question. .\nThomas Polen : Yes. Thanks, Rick, for the question. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Tom Polen for any closing remarks.\nThomas Polen: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for the very good questions today. I just want to take a moment and thank our team again around the world for an extremely strong FY '22, a challenging macro environment. And all of the work and sacrifice that all of our 75,000 associates around the world have made this past year to deliver for our customers and the patients that we mutually serve. Obviously, we've outlined a very strong outlook for FY '23, and we look forward to continuing to focus relentlessly on executing our BD 2025 strategy and bringing that to life. So thank you very much, and have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Tom. And Robbie, thanks for the question. And just as I get into answering that, I just, given this is my first chance on the Q&A here, I do want to just recognize and thank the Life Sciences team globally and all the associates for another outstanding year in fiscal '22. I mean you saw the quarter growth of over 8% there, a record base growth of 13.8% for the year. So Life Sciences continues to be strong. On flu respiratory, I'll just build upon what Tom has said is, if you think about it pre-pandemic, we were always in this range right of the $75 million to $100 million, we were considering the normal flu season. I think also to remember that, that was on Veritor only. We have not really anticipated or seen a normal flu season during the pandemic at all. Definitely in October, we are seeing more visits to urgent care centers and things on influenza-like illness. But again, when you look at it, we think the season has started, it's about eight to nine weeks early. It peaked very quickly in Australia. So it's a little bit early to call what it would look like. I think if we were looking at the range for this year, based on just leverage of the Veritor installed base, we would expect that sort of that flu range of that Veritor base to be about 130 million to 150 million."

            "name": "Mike Garrison",
            "content": "Hi, Vijay, thanks for the question on product. Parata, yes, we're very excited about Parata, also the MedKeeper, the Medbank acquisitions that are in the portfolio. They are just great teams with a passion for their craft. And it may be the things that are differentiating it in our approach, the extensive diligence we did prior to the acquisition, a real focus on culture in the first 30 days of working with the teams. And then we also set up an integration management office within MMS with some of our senior leaders to really guide and focus on each individual work stream across the functions to make sure that the acquisition goes well out of the gate. But I think the main thing is the value proposition is very strong and clear for Parata. It directly addresses the labor shortages and the clinical efficiencies that customers are seeking, especially right now, and as well as their long-term goals around smart, connected care, data-driven decision making, things like that. So it both addresses short-term needs and long-term needs, and that's why customers are reacting so favorably to it. Yes. Thanks, Tom. Even though there's a -- we recognized a tough economic environment, the uncertainty there, we're not experiencing the same degree of capital pressure that maybe have been communicated elsewhere. In fact, we finished Q4 with a record year for bookings, have a strong implementation schedule planned for, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is the strategy continues to resonate with the Connected Med Management Solutions, again, addressing the labor shortages and our ability to flex and implement both with business model, but also these highly skilled service, a lot of ex-nurses, ex-IT people. These are people that our customers are increasingly seeing the value of partnering with us because we can flex to meet their needs. So both of those things, I think, are really helping, and we're getting a lot of utilization out of the infusion side of the business. Yes. Thanks, Rick. This is Mike. Yes. So the -- my priority is the same as it was in the MMS role, is that getting Alaris back to market. It's a top priority for the company. And so it remains my top priority. Beyond that, a lot of it has to do with making sure that our innovation is productive, that dollars that we're spending in R&D get value out to customers. And because innovation that never makes it to a customer isn't productive at all. I think that constantly creating a culture where we're developing and coaching our talent to be better each day and have a continuous improvement mentality. I think that's really critical, especially in the current environment, the same way that our customers are facing labor pressures, we are, too. And so if we're the best place to work and people feel that they can belong a greater purpose that we provide, I think that's really, really important. And then finally, I think that there's just an approach to leadership that I hope that we have a performance-based culture of commitment. So whenever we make a commitment, we meet the commitment and we keep our mindset around that. So maybe a bit of a lean processes, but in an abundant mindset would be the way that I think about it. And I'm really -- last thing is Rick actually interviewed me and hired me 18 years ago. So everything I have, I owe to Rick. So thanks, Rick."

            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm extremely proud of our organization and our performance this year. We closed the year with excellent momentum, having delivered strong and consistent growth in our base business. For the full fiscal year, we exceeded our revenue and earnings guidance and achieved our margin expansion goal. Our performance this year confirms BD 2025 is the right strategy and it's working. Our results reflect our strategy in action and the focused execution and dedication of our global teams who reliably served our customers, controlled costs and increased productivity during a challenging environment. At Investor Day in November 2021, we outlined our plan to build sustained shareholder value creation in five key focus areas. Today, I'm pleased to review the progress we've made to achieve this plan. First, we delivered consistent performance and durably strengthened our growth profile. Our FY '22 results are on track with our long-range targets to deliver 5.5 plus top line and double-digit EPS growth with operating margin improvement back toward our pre-pandemic level. In FY '22, we drove 9.4% revenue growth in our base business. Additionally, we achieved our margin expansion goals in an increasing inflationary environment by both leveraging our revenue performance and realizing savings and efficiencies from several of our multiyear simplification and cost improvement initiatives. As a result, we delivered $11.35 in adjusted diluted EPS.  Second, we continue to reshape our portfolio by advancing our innovation pipeline and M&A strategy towards higher-growth markets. In FY '22, we continued to transform our innovation pipeline with about 60% of our new product development invested in three market spaces that are reshaping healthcare and helping to fuel our growth: smart, connected care; enabling new care settings; and improving chronic disease outcomes. We believe our current pipeline is the most exciting in the history of the company. In addition, we deployed over $2 billion this year towards six tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were allocated towards higher growth markets. This includes Parata Systems, our largest acquisition since Bard, which is aligned to our focus on smart, connected care and enabling new care settings. Parata makes BD the global leader in the fast-growing pharmacy automation market and enables us to provide solutions to help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages. With today's transformative solutions from pharmacy automation to biotech drug delivery devices, to high-throughput molecular diagnostic systems and new dies and instruments for immuno-oncology and multi-omics research to at-home solutions for urinary incontinence, we are systematically creating a new wave of future growth for BD. Third, we executed our simplification programs and managed our cost structure. Like every other company, we face tremendous inflationary pressure. We saw the pressure coming early on, and we took action immediately putting in place an inflation task force to attack it from every side. We also prioritized our internal cost reduction programs and significantly leveraged our selling and G&A expense, driving strong operating leverage. In addition, we actively managed our portfolio, including spinning Embecta, as well as exiting more than 2,500 SKUs as we accelerated our Project RECODE initiative to simplify our portfolio and exit products that add complexity in our plant. A leaner portfolio and less complex manufacturing processes allowed us to improve output with the same fixed cost base and optimize our mix to produce more of the products most critical to our customers. We furthered our investments in what matters to our customers, strengthening our supply chain, validating secondary suppliers and building key component inventory all factors that have been even more important in a supply-constrained environment. And finally, as we drove strong revenue growth beyond our original expectations, we leveraged our scale and excellence in manufacturing as volumes in our plants recovered from FY '20 and '21 lows due to COVID disruptions and procedures. As a result, in FY '22, we were able to absorb significant increases in inflation during the year and improved our margin profile back towards BD's pre-pandemic levels of 25% in FY '25.  Fourth, we maintained a disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. Over the last few years, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and improved flexibility. This has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support growth-enhancing investments in capital R&D and tuck-in M&A. We're now at 2.8x net leverage, and both Moody's and Fitch upgraded our debt this year, reflecting the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment. Also, this framework gave us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We just announced our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. And finally, our strong teams continue to execute and create value even during uncertain times. Our execution in FY '22 is a testament to our growth mindset at BD, where we firmly believe there's nothing we can't do, only things we haven't done yet. And by navigating successfully the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to consistently deliver strong performance. These capabilities are now all embedded in our operating principles and with the strong execution abilities across our network. They're having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability. In summary, these proof points reflect how BD 2025 and the actions we've taken in FY '22 and over the past several years, uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong and consistent results.  I'll now provide more detail on the progress we made this year on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. In FY '22, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 25 key new products. We are on track to achieve our new product revenue contribution as outlined at Investor Day and are increasing our portfolio weighting in attractive, faster-growing markets. Our product launches reinforce our leadership position in our durable core and expand our offering in higher-growth spaces across smart, connected care, enabling new care settings and improving outcomes for chronic disease. These launches strengthened our position in strategic areas such as medication safety, immunology research reagents, molecular and point-of-care diagnostics, peripheral vascular disease and incontinence. Examples include PosiFlush SafeScrub, our next-generation flush product; Prevue, our peripheral vascular access system; BD COR, our fully automated high throughput molecular system and related women's health and STI assays; and the PureWick Male External Catheter. I'm excited by the progress we've made advancing our innovation-driven growth strategy and the strides we've made to improve outcomes for patients and providers and create value for our stakeholders. I'll now share a few updates on the progress our team made this year to advance our ESG strategy and goals. Together We Advance serves as a framework for our ESG strategy. In July, we published our 2021 ESG report, which provides details about our ESG strategy and progress against our 2030 commitments. Highlights include the launch of the BD Sustainable Medical Technology Institute, efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emission, including joining the UN race to zero and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy. Just last month, BD in Sandy, Utah was awarded the Blue Sky Legacy Award for making significant strides towards Utah's environmental sustainability. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact on our communities. We also made progress on our workforce IDE goals, ending FY '22 with increased diversity at the executive and management levels, and we remain committed to having an inclusive workplace. We're proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we were named to Forbes 2022 list of the world's best employers, a recognition of BD as a great place for the world's best talent to work as part of a healthy and inclusive community. Before I turn it over to Chris, as we look forward to FY '23, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD 2025 as we move toward the second half of our strategic plan period.  Starting with the macro environment. Our BD 2025 strategy and the capabilities we have built over the past two years position us well to navigate what we expect to be some persistent macro challenges and uncertainty facing all companies. We reiterate our conviction in the three irreversible forces shaping health care and our strategy to address them. For example, as it relates to smart, connected care, there's an increasing need for digitalization and automation of healthcare processes as providers look for ways to increase efficiency and address labor and inflationary challenges. Regarding inflation and supply chain, our perspective continues to be that challenges are going to persist, not escalate at least through 2023. And although inflation could potentially start easing somewhat, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically. Companies that have processes, systems and capabilities to navigate this environment will continue to thrive over the next couple of years. And as we move forward, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of BD 2025, which will continue to serve as our true north. This includes delivering impactful innovations for our customers by expanding our leadership positions in our durable core and continuing to invest to expand our portfolio in the higher growth areas that are transforming healthcare. In addition, Alaris remains our #1 priority, and we're making good progress. While we don't comment on the status of the review or approval timing, we are taking all the steps necessary to provide the required regulatory information and support our customers upon clearance. We will also continue our investments to increase manufacturing capacity, strengthen our supply chain and increase supplier redundancy to help ensure we continue to reliably supply our products for our customers. We will continue to focus on initiatives to return our margin profile to FY '19 pre-pandemic levels in FY '25. This includes accelerating initiatives like Project RECODE, including our efforts around operating model simplification, resulting in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization. We expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. Our priorities include investing in our business through R&D and CapEx. After investing organically and returning value through dividends, we will continue to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and return value to shareholders through share repurchases. And we expect to continue to stay ahead of the curve as we navigate the macro environment, leveraging the capabilities we have built that are now embedded in our operating principles. We recently celebrated BD's 125th year anniversary as a company, demonstrating our durable model underpinned by our tradition of relentless focus on innovation and operational excellence. We're really excited about what the future holds. And with the performance of our global teams, we'll continue to grow our impact on customers and patients and advance the world of health.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Thanks, Chris. Our BD 2025 strategy is demonstrating strong momentum and performance positioning BD to be increasingly well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders and successfully navigate and differentiate in today's challenging environment. . I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health. And before I turn it to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Mike and Rick to their new roles, leading the Medical and Interventional segments, respectively. Both Mike and Rick are highly effective leaders who have demonstrated strategic and operational excellence, and they're nearly two decades at BD. Their focus on driving growth and meaningful outcomes has been critical as we pursue our BD 2025 strategy, and they are well-rounded seasoned leaders with a track record of developing strong teams that deliver impactful results. Their broad experiences across multiple BD businesses and segments position them well for their new roles as we advance our growth agenda and build BD's future. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue? Larry, as always, great to connect, and thanks for that question. So as we've mentioned on several occasions, getting Alaris back on the market is our #1 priority. We remain confident in the resources we've invested in our submission in the team and a leadership task to prioritize this in our process and we are confident that we will get clearance. What we also want to be -- continue to be prudent on Larry and thoughtful about the process with the FDA. And so therefore, that's why we're not predicting time lines given how inherently complex those submissions are -- as you said and as we've shared in the past, the relaunch of Alaris is included within our strategic plan as we provided at Investor Day, and there is no change to that. We just -- as I mentioned before, we want to not predict those time lines, but we are prepared for launch when that clearance comes so that we can best support our customers. And as you know, we did launch Alaris -- the new Alaris pump in Canada this past year, and we're getting very positive feedback from customers there. So thank you for the question. This is Tom. So no, we continue to have active discussions with the FDA on Alaris. And as I mentioned, things are progressing towards our process, and we'll obviously give an update when we get ultimately clearance on that, but we don't want to try to predict the timing on that. And so therefore, again, as we have been being prudent, we haven't reflected that in our guidance specific approval timing. So we do have the same run rate of medical necessity in our guidance, which is about $100 million, same as '22. We've carried that forward into '23. And to your question on vaccines, it is a headwind in '23 that we're jumping over there. There's relatively limited vaccination demand ongoing for COVID. And so that's definitely a headwind that we're jumping over in MDS, but we have that covered. Yes, VJ. So on the hypo, we won't share the specific number there. But it is a -- there's very limited revenue, vaccine-related in hypo that we have planned for '23. Related to Parata, you're right. We have very strong performance in Parata at/or slightly ahead of our deal model on that. So we're off to a great start, and we're seeing really strong demand. And let me turn it over to Mike Garrison here, who, of course, led that acquisition when he was leading MMS and now continues to be over that as is leading the Medical segment. So Mike? Robbie, this is Tom. Good to connect this morning. We've got Dave on the call down in -- with our Latin America team at their kickoff meeting. But I'll tag Dave into the conversation here in just a moment. But related to flu combo. So we are in our assumptions, we do have that moderating a bit versus this past year, where we saw a lot of demand for the flu COVID combo driven by COVID. To your point, there is a potential. We don't see it as significant of a demand driven by the COVID side of the combo test necessarily as we look going forward in '23. Certainly, there can be a greater potential for the flu side demand and differentiating between flu and COVID. I think as you said, it's off to an early start, the flu season, still to be determined the scale of it. In Australia, we saw an early start to the season, but we saw a very narrow onetime peak in that demand. And so actually, the area under the curve was less than normal. And so there was a severe very short flu season in Australia that did not end up creating significant demand and testing because it was such a short duration still to be determined how that rolls out in the U.S., and so we want to be prudent upfront. Maybe Dave, I'll turn it to you to share some more comment here. That's great. Maybe just to add to Chris' comment, and it's a good question, Robbie. Back to -- we are facing, as all companies are, serious inflationary pressures, right, that are happening across the industry and all industries. I think just want to call out our plants. They're doing a phenomenal job. The last thing that we look to do in any situation is price. And so as you heard Chris walk through the order of priorities for us, our plants really have risen and almost doubled the level of normal continuous improvement that we've done historically, they've risen to that task and working to offset as much of that cost as possible. The other thing is the action that we talked about earlier around that strategic portfolio exit, as we're bringing in M&A, and we have strong underlying growth, taking this time to evaluate our portfolio and look at where they're nonstrategic products that are diluting our operational effectiveness in our plants that we can get better performance out of our lines, out of our staffing, out of our resource deployment, and take those actions set us up for strength in the long term. We're doing that this year, and that's helping us also have a role in offsetting those inflationary pressures at making us more efficient in our plants and helping make sure that we can deliver the products that matter most that we're focusing our resources on delivering those products that matter most for our customers that are going to be driving value for us and our shareholders long term. Sure. Good question, Matt, and I appreciate it. So as you know, BD is among the world's largest producers of medical products that are critical for patient care. And our devices and products, they have to meet FDA sterilization standards. And just as background, I think everyone is aware that numerous types of devices and other sensitive medical products, for many of them, EtO is the only type of sterilization that can be used. In fact, about 50% of all medical products across the industry use EtO for sterilization. And the majority of those products that use EtO for sterilization, other sterilization methods will damage the products like radiation or steam or chloride dioxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide, they actually would damage those products. That's why EtO is used. And you wouldn't be able to ensure the required level of sterility given the materials that are used in those products. And so we're very confident in the systems we've been investing in for decades and can say that our sterilization facilities use the best available EtO emissions control technology in the industry. We achieved more than 99.95% destruction of EtO from our stack admissions. And in accordance with the broad FDA challenge, we continue to invest in cycle optimization and EtO technology upgrades, extending outside of our plants now. And so we take the safety of our associates and the communities we're in very seriously and therefore, have a long history of proactively upgrading our emissions control technology supported by continuous investments back to your good question. So if you go all the way back to -- even let's go back to 1997. We proactively upgraded our emissions control equipment in Georgia to thermal oxidizers all the way back then and began routing back then exhaust in Georgia to the primary emissions control equipment. It's something that still isn't necessarily routine across the industry today. We're at the forefront of that. Today, we have programs and procedures in place to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, including EPA, OSHA, state environmental protection agencies, FDA. Our facilities are at least 20x more efficient at removing EtO per cubic meter of air than what's currently required by the Clean Air Act. And we're working with the FDA and other industry leaders to develop, look at new sterilization cycles that could even take emissions down further than what's ever been possible before. Just as it relates to our outstanding litigation, there are no new cases that have been brought since the third quarter, and we have not taken any accrual in connection with any of the outstanding EtO cases. We've gone through a rigorous process internally and externally, and we do intend to vigorously defend any such cases, given our strong position in the way that we operate. And maybe just 1 other thing to add, Josh, is, as Chris mentioned, so we kept our commercial team. We kept our service team, which as we relaunch again, we'll see the positive flow through since those expenses are already on the P&L and the recovery of that. That 80 bps of dilution that we currently have on the P&L. Just on there is a benefit that we're seeing right now is we're seeing very strong demand on other capital areas within MMS, particularly in the Pyxis area, where we're able to utilize some of those additional service capabilities that we have to actually help us in the installs on the Pyxis side, and maybe since we have Mike here today who again was recently leading that business, maybe Mike, if you just want to comment on some of the broader demand we're seeing on the capital side on the MMS. And they're onetime in nature? Great question, Rick, and great to connect. So -- and I agree, we have a very strong CFO, by the way, as well, too. But so we do have a very strong funnel, and we continue to be very focused specifically on tuck-in M&A. No change to our strategy there, as we've articulated many times. We're going to continue to focus our M&A as we have over 95% of our M&A to date has been in those transformative solution categories, as you called out, smart, connected care, enabling the shift to new care settings and improving outcomes in chronic disease. We've also shared that expect more Parata like in size tuck-in M&As as we look forward. So it may not be -- we've done 19 in the last 2.5 years, maybe fewer deals going forward, but of larger scale and impact, given the benefits that we have and the execution that the businesses are focused on and the ones that we've done to date. I'd say that the other thing is we're going to continue our very disciplined approach to M&A. Really proud of the team, not just for the deals that we've done, but from the deals that we've walked away from. That's something we've -- we're really pleased with, the work that we've done and how our deals are executing to plan and the return that they're delivering for our shareholders in a meaningful way. And so we're going to keep that discipline as well. But we do see opportunities will continue to be paced and appropriate about it as we go forward and staying very true to advancing our strategy, continuing to move us into those higher-growth markets. And you see us being very active. One of our portfolio management, not only through M&A, but obviously, completing the spin of Inventor earlier this year and some of the very targeted onetime portfolio exits that we shared today that are basically puts and takes with the inorganic growth that we see coming this year. I think, Rick, maybe just to share one of the other things is, as we said, within the quarter, we saw some backorders in BDI. One of the things that I know, Rick, just you're focusing on helping the team is bringing some of the operational excellence from having led MDS for many years, bringing some of those capabilities from the broader BD operating side into the BDI segment. And maybe just a couple of comments there because that's a big focus. The great benefits of obviously being able to rotate talent across diverse groups of businesses. And I think Rick's background, as everyone knows, MDS is probably the most operationally heavy business within the company, just given the billions of products we make on syringes and catheters and bringing that where the BDI businesses have been very innovation-driven and growth driven. It's a very nice complementary skill and leadership to be able to bring in those capabilities over. So great question. . Yes. Thanks, Rick, for the question. Okay. Thank you, everyone, for the very good questions today. I just want to take a moment and thank our team again around the world for an extremely strong FY '22, a challenging macro environment. And all of the work and sacrifice that all of our 75,000 associates around the world have made this past year to deliver for our customers and the patients that we mutually serve. Obviously, we've outlined a very strong outlook for FY '23, and we look forward to continuing to focus relentlessly on executing our BD 2025 strategy and bringing that to life. So thank you very much, and have a great rest of the day."

            "name": "Christopher DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year which reflects our growth strategy playing out as planned. Through execution of our BD 2025 strategy, we are fulfilling our short-term commitments while progressing towards our long-term goals. Beginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our revenue growth expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. We delivered $4.8 billion in revenue in Q4, with base business growth of 8.6% or 6.8% organic. Parata contributed about 140 basis points to growth in the quarter and about 40 basis points to the full year. COVID-only testing revenues were $37 million, which is expected decline from $316 million last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $18.9 billion in revenue with base business growth of 9.4% and or 8.5% organic. COVID-only testing revenues were $511 million, which, as expected, declined from $2 billion last year.  Total company base business growth was strong across all three segments with double-digit growth in BD Life Sciences and high single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in EMEA. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 20 basis points for the full year.  Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 10.2% with strong performance across the segment. Growth was driven by strong growth in MDS of 8%, driven by continued execution of our comprehensive vascular access management strategy; MMS growth of 11.5%, driven by strong demand of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation strategies, including our recent acquisition of Parata as customers focus on automation to drive efficiency to help address the constrained labor market, and another quarter of double-digit growth of 12.8% in Pharmaceutical Systems based on our strong leadership position in prefillable solutions for biologics and vaccines. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The decline of 11.6% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 8.3% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences. Base business growth was driven by IDS growth of 8.6%, enabled by continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD MAX installed base and continued demand for our leading clinical microbiology and specimen management platforms. And lastly, BDB growth of 7.5%, driven by continued demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry instruments as researchers are able to do even higher parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions.  BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 5.7%. Growth was driven by surgery growth of 5.4% and supported by our Advanced Repair and Reconstruction portfolio with strong market adoption of our leading Phasix hernia products. PI growth of 4.8%, which reflects continued expansion of our venous portfolio highlighted by Venclose in the U.S. and the global relaunch of Venovo. PI performance also reflects increased back orders primarily related to a BDI specific European ERP system implementation. Urology growth of 7.2% reflects continued strong demand for our PureWick Female incontinence solutions in both acute and alternative care settings. Now moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.75 increased 28%. Base business gross margin of 52.5% was up 80 basis points and base operating margin of 22.5% was up 430 basis points year-over-year. Full year adjusted diluted EPS of $11.35 grew 0.6%. As we anticipated, we made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals despite increasing inflation pressures. For the full year, base business gross margin of 53.4% was up 110 basis points and base operating margin of 22.4% was up 280 basis points. The key full year drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flowed through sales this year.  Base operating margin reflects strong operating expense leverage with base selling and G&A as a percent of sales, leveraging by 180 basis points, partially offset by significant inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping. To put this in perspective, shipping expense increased at a double-digit rate in our base business. This increase in shipping was offset with focused efforts on cost management and leverage of selling and G&A which only grew at about 1/3 the rate of sales and was the primary driver of 21% currency-neutral growth in base operating income. This is a testament to the tremendous work by our organization to mitigate inflation and execute our margin enhancement initiatives. This was also a key enabler in supporting continued investment in R&D at just over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $2.5 billion in FY '22. Operating cash flow reflects a higher inventory balance of about $600 million year-over-year. The increase reflects the impact of inflation, longer in-transit lead times and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand. As expected, our free cash flow conversion this year was below our long-term target. We remain very focused on cash flow conversion and we are taking actions to moderate inventory down. But in the short term, we believe it's a prudent trade-off to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy and supply chain constraints normalize, we expect to migrate towards our long-term cash conversion target.  In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested over $2 billion in six tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2023 and beyond. Beyond our investments in growth, consistent with what we shared regarding the planned use of Embecta proceeds, we paid down $500 million in long-term debt this fiscal year and returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Moving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Our FY '23 guidance aligns with the framework we communicated last quarter and the value creation model and long-term targets we outlined at our Investor Day to deliver 5.5% plus base revenue growth, continued margin improvement and double-digit base earnings growth on a currency-neutral basis. As a reminder, we manage our business on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance, consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar. Beyond that change, our guidance has only strengthened in a complex macro environment, where we continue to see elevated inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.  Starting with revenues. I'll provide you some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect base revenues to grow 5.25% to 6.25%, which is a strong growth of 5.75% at the midpoint. This midpoint is above our 5.5% plus target we outlined during our Investor Day, given the confidence we have in our strengthening growth profile. Our revenue guidance includes two proactive strategic portfolio management actions that are consistent with our BD 2025 strategy and support our value creation goals. First, building on our FY '22 achievements. Our base revenue guidance includes planned strategic portfolio exits as part of the acceleration of our portfolio simplification and RECODE programs. These actions will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter the most to our customers. We expect these actions to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin. Second, offsetting this revenue impact is a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions with Parata being the predominant driver. We will continue to be active in portfolio management as a lever to create value for all stakeholders. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to achieve our long-range plan commitments, and we are assuming strong performance across the segments in FY '23. And we expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comparisons and Interventional to be at the high end of the range. Consistent with what we shared, we expect COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings to be at a level significantly below FY '22, with revenues more in line with the annualization of our Q4 FY '22 results or approximately $125 million to $175 million for the full year.  Regarding Alaris, consistent with what we've done in the past, we are only modeling shipments related to medical necessity. While we will be prepared when clearance is received, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp to revenues upon clearance.  Regarding our assumptions on earnings. We expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points over the 22.6% reported in FY '22. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving pre-pandemic operating margin levels of about 25% and in FY '25. First, to give you some color on inflationary assumptions. As a reminder, outsized inflation in FY '22 was a headwind of over 200 basis points we expect a similar level of incremental outsized inflation in FY '23. The primary drivers of the incremental inflation are raw material costs and labor, which are about equally weighted. Even though we see some signs of cost normalizing in certain areas, a lot of the outsized inflation is from inventory we manufactured in FY '22 as there's about a four to six-month lag from production to sell-through. Labor costs, especially in our manufacturing plants, have continued to increase. We have taken proactive actions to ensure we are differentiating BD to retain our skilled workforce. Lastly, transportation costs have stabilized, and we've begun to see some downward movement on certain rates. However, we are still above more normalized levels. We remain committed to leading through the macro complexity while making investments to support our customers to offset these inflationary impacts we continue to leverage our strong growth profile and drive outsized cost reduction and other mitigation programs. We expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A driven by internal cost containment and leveraging. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales. Our simplification initiatives include continuing to execute on Project RECODE. You will recall when we announced RECODE, it was intended to deliver $300 million in savings by the end of fiscal year '24, with portfolio and network optimization representing about 70% of the savings. We are accelerating these efforts and are also making significant progress with the third pillar of RECODE, operating model simplification, which will result in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization. In addition, to provide some color below operating income, we expect an increase of approximately $50 million to $75 million in interest/other. This is primarily driven by increased pension expense, which we fully covered in our guidance, and is a result of the negative movement in the financial markets. For tax, based on what we know today, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13.5% and 14.5%. It would not be unusual for our rate to fluctuate above or below this range on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Our guidance assumes no material change in average common shares outstanding from our average FY '22 share balance. This takes into account the conversion of all outstanding preferred shares on June 1, 2023, the benefit from the FY '22 share repurchase and associated with the use of the impacted distribution and our commitment to mitigate the dilution from share-based compensation. So on an all-in basis, we expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 300 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing; and as a result, implies a very strong low teens base earnings growth of approximately 12% to 14%. Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in August, the U.S. dollar strengthened against all major currencies. Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 450 basis points or about $850 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This currency headwind has nearly doubled since our August call. Our guidance assumes the euro at 0.99, which is down about 4% since August. The Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian dollar have also all declined even more than the euro since August by almost 2x the euro movement. For context, these four currencies combined are in line with our total euro exposure. The currency headwind to EPS growth has also nearly doubled since our August earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 420 basis points to adjusted EPS growth. All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $11.85 and to $12.10. As you think of fiscal '23 phasing, there are three key items to consider. First, FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue will be over-indexed to the first half. For the full year, we expect the drop-through to earnings to be below our BDX operating margin. Due to the expected benefit from inventory flow-through in Q1, the drop-through is expected to start well below the full year average and most significantly impact the second and third quarters. Second is the grow-over impact of COVID-related dynamics. As a reminder, in FY '22, almost 80% of COVID-only testing revenue was realized in the first half of the year, with strong margin drop-through as reinvestment was weighted to the latter part of the year. In addition, there is also a comp to strong first half performance in FY '22 related to combo testing in the base business.  And the third is inflation. Nearly 40% of the full year inflation headwind is expected to occur in Q1 as we sell through inventory manufactured in FY '22 in the first half of the year.  As a result of these items, as you think of the progression of our total operating margin expansion through the year, for Q1, you should expect a year-over-year decline driven primarily by the year-over-year comparison of higher COVID-only testing. We expect operating expansion to ramp over the remainder of the year with the majority occurring in the second half. As a reminder, there are some tough comparisons to the prior year in Q1, such as the benefit of about $50 million in licensing revenues in Life Sciences. As a result of these dynamics, we expect Q1 base revenue growth and adjusted EPS to be under-indexed relative to an equal quarterly phasing of the full year. So this guide, coupled with our FY '22 results, has us progressing very well towards our FY '25 goals, including a two-year revenue CAGR assuming the FY '23 midpoint of 5.75% that is well above the 5.5% plus target at around 7.5%, achievement of nearly 400 basis points of margin improvement or over 70% of the way towards our FY '25 objective and two consecutive years of strong double-digit adjusted earnings growth in our base business.  In closing, we are very pleased with our performance, particularly given the macro complexity and inflationary pressure we navigated. The consistent execution we delivered and our ability to mitigate these challenges through FY '22 enabled our results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders. With that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments. Yes. Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with our growth rate. As you noted, I think what we're delivering is a testament to our strategy playing out, delivering consistent growth in both our durable core balanced with acceleration through transformative solutions, coupled with the actually organic contribution from the tuck-in M&A that we're starting to see as we anniversary acquisitions more than a year. There's about a 20 basis point contribution to growth.  So as you noted, 9.4 this year, really strong year, in a year by the way where we actually had an increasing complex environment. Our ability to grow double digits in China as an example with some of the dynamics we saw play out there, 8.5% organic. I think there's a few things that I think will give you some color to kind of understand. Our underlying growth rate remains extremely strong as it relates to our '23 guide. If you think of it as a two-year period at 7.5% growth over a two-year period comping over that 9.4%, this is well above our 5.5-plus even if you adjust out, from an inorganic standpoint, the growth is still at about 7%. So we -- I also think it's a strong indication that we're actually consistently delivering this growth. On the strategic portfolio exits, let me give some color on that. This is a bit different. It's certainly consistent with our simplification strategies. And really, it's the strength of our underlying business and the strong growth outlook that allows us to take these strategic bold actions to create value for our customers and our shareholders. These are the kind of things that investors should want us to do, and we're very fortunate to be able to take this opportunity. It's consistent with our relentless focus on portfolio. And what we're essentially doing different from SKU rationalization, which is really simplifying the SKUs that we go to market with, that require work, investment, reregistrations, et cetera. These are pure portfolio exits. You almost need to think of them. It's a onetime kind of divestiture as we took a step back, looked at our portfolio, trying to understand where we could best create value, again, both through the lens of our customer and through the lens of our investors. So these are areas, for example, that would fit a typical divestiture growth profile. These are not accretive to growth. These are significantly dilutive to margin, in many cases, well below half our existing margin rate and the right thing to do. I'd also point to the fact that while these were dilutive to margin, they did actually benefit our earnings. And so we had absorbed that in a very strong earnings guide, right, when you think of our bottom line of 9% to 11% double digits at the midpoint on an FX-neutral basis. And that's on an all-in comping over the COVID-only lost revenue year-over-year. And so adjusting for that, we still delivered about 12% to 14% of base earnings growth. So we think this is the right thing to do for the long term. It's the right thing to do. Our underlying business, I actually think it's fair to think of that 1% impact roughly differently, almost like an inorganic adjustment because the rest of our portfolio continues to perform strong. As a matter of fact, we -- if you look at the 5.75, it's above the 5.5 midpoint. And then I'll go back to the two year, which is, again, on an organic basis, over 7%. So hopefully, that helps kind of explain that part of the guide. We feel great about our revenue and certainly feel good about the bottom line. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Appreciate it. Yes, I can take the Parata question as it relates to the margin, and then either Dave and/or Tom can maybe talk about COVID flu, how we're thinking about it. Parata, what we've shared publicly is it was immediately accretive to BD. We weren't specific with the amount. But actually, we did say it's actually even accretive to our long-range outlook, which is think of it as that about 25% from an operating margin. So it is certainly a positive contributor on the bottom line. I will just reinforce, remember, as you think of our total all in. So Parata, I think, is a great example of adding a strategic asset with a strong growth profile, strong accretion on the margin standpoint. We did have to jump over the COVID-only, which was a $300 million-plus drag on the top line that also had a higher, slightly higher margin profile. So I think when you look at our total guide at 9% to 11%, that's very strong, and we kind of reversed into the math we had shared that the COVID-only was about 300 basis points headwind in total. It implies a 12% to 14% base earnings growth profile. This is really strong, well, very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, especially again in an inflationary environment, where we're going to have similar levels of inflation year-over-year. Yes, Robbie. Thanks. So yes, as it relates to 100 basis points, as you noted, definitely another strong year of margin enhancement. That would put us about 70% on track to deliver against our FY '25 goal of about 25%. So really strong progress, having delivered almost half of that in the first year.  So not only do we feel good about what we delivered last year, continuing that momentum and driving towards our long-term objectives. Yes, there's a couple of ways to think of it. One, the predominant driver of margin improvement this year is really going to be leveraging our strong growth profile, focused on cost containment more at the operating margin level, in selling and G&A. So that's about 80% plus of that 100 basis points improvement that we're expecting. The balance is really, there's a little bit of moderating R&D back to our 6% goal. We've actually been over-indexed two years in that area. So obviously, like other areas, you'd expect to, without impacting project spend, just leverage your base with a strong growth profile, 6% is a good outcome there. The balance, which is really minor then, is in GP. So GP, you're going to kind of see that's where we're experiencing most of the inflationary impacts. As a matter of fact, you're seeing a little bit of relief in shipping. It's still above historic what we call normal levels. You're seeing some benefit there as well that's playing out mostly in the operating margin side. As it relates to where we're seeing the most inflationary pressures, it's still raw materials. It's shifted a bit more from kind of resins to other materials, such as packaging would be an example. We do have a carryover effect, too, of the inventory that was built in '22. And so a lot of that will hit in the first half of the year. And the other big area where you still continue to say, I would say, escalating pressures is labor. So labor and raw materials is about 50-50 each of what we're realizing in GP. Obviously, we're taking a ton of action within GP probably in this order in terms of how we think of them. not necessarily size, but as we always think of driving cost improvement, one, it starts with our growth profile, outsized volume in our plants, leveraging our plants portfolio, favorable mix to the extent we can drive that outsized cost improvement, again, going back to our plant mindset as it relates to growth mindset and driving more efficiency and then other factors such as price as well would be part of that equation lastly. So that's how we're thinking of inflation this year and what we're doing to mitigate it. And we're very pleased with the progress that we've had year-to-date. As it relates to FX, we gave some color. Certainly, the team can support you through that in more detail. The drop-through from sales to earnings is slightly lower as consistent with what we've shared in the past on a full year basis. You're going to see sort of quarterly phasing dynamics play out differently because you have the nuance of how FX impacts cost and inventory and how that flows through. You got that four to six-month lag. So you'll see a little bit more favorability in the first half, and it normalized to the full year drop-through that we shared by the end. Yes. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it. Yes. So I'll just -- I'll share some things that we've shared in the past. One, from a total sales point, we had always talked about that business being roughly $400 million is the way to think of it.  From a medical necessity standpoint, we've talked about $100 million per year. That's what we had last year roughly, and we're planning sort of consistently this year. So that gives you that kind of frame as you think of the size. I will remind you when upon clearance, you would expect a gradual ramp over time. We have not shared a specific timeline that's hard to predict. But maybe just to give a little context, some folks have sort of asked like, okay, are we talking less than a year-over-year. It wouldn't be less than a year, it would ramp up over some time frame, probably over a 12-month period that should help you a little bit. But certainly well within our LRP time period. Margin, we haven't shared specifics by year. What we did share, if you go back to the deleveraging that occurred from our FY 2019, there was about an 80 basis point headwind to our margin. And it's -- that largely stays the same, and we'll adjust as the product comes back. If you think of it, we -- one, we made investments in regulatory quality, of course, we maintained our service and field organization. And so as the sales come back, you would get natural leveraging to occur as we've made those investments to continue to support our installed base and customers. No. I appreciate the question. Yes. No, that hadn't been contemplated at that point. Again, we took a hard look at our portfolio in the spirit of simplification. This is different from our core Recode program that has a different lens. Similar principles, but a very different lens in terms of a pure exit. We really wanted to make sure we were focusing on our organization in higher value-creating areas. And so this was an add. And again, I think there's so many puts and takes across the year. Looking at this two-year metric, however you look at it, 7-plus percent growth on an organic basis is extremely strong. And we think this is an appropriate action to think we could easily put that back in, right? And our base growth would go up by 100 bps, but this is the right thing to do for all stakeholders over the long term. And we'll be creating significant value and has not impacted our bottom line performance at all."

            "content": "Too kind, Mike, thanks. So Rick, thanks for the question. So as I round out pretty much 60 days in the role, I'm truly inspired by the opportunity that we have in BDI to collectively enhance patient lives. So innovations like PureWick, Phasix, Venovo, just to name a few, are truly life changers for patients. And then also, as I go around the business, the commitment, the capability of the team, from our salesperson, R&D, manufacturing technicians in the plants, doesn't matter. Everyone is really focused on the patient. And so first, as Chris mentioned, and we had a great year, right? BDI grew at 7.1%, which is at the high end of our long-range plan. And again, as we said, our commitment there for next year is right there again. So we're on track for that long-range plan. So my priority is keep driving these innovations, keep meeting our commitments as a segment and continue to have a difference in chronic disease treatment and then on the associates within BD and then all the customers that we serve. So really a great opportunity, and I appreciate the question. Thanks. Great. No, I think we have a great opportunity to improve the supply chain to give an example of the ERP system upgrade, finally, bringing in fully integrating BDI into the beauty system as well. These are going to provide efficiencies to hold deliver products to our customers reliably, on time and things like that. So again, I've spent a lot of my time first off in BDI, looking at opportunities that we can continue to streamline things, drive operational effectiveness. Exactly. So thanks, Tom, for that."

I would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines terms you will hear today, such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results, excluding estimated COVID-only testing.  With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong Q3 results. We exceeded our revenue, operating margin and earnings goals and delivered another quarter of consistent strong performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 9.3%. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of BD's performance even during an uncertain market environment, with year-to-date base business growth of 9.6%.  I want to thank our team of over 75,000 talented associates, who continue to deliver on the Growth, Simplify and Empower pillars of our BD2025 strategy. Our performance reflects the team's agility and strong execution, which puts us ahead of the curve in our ability to manage inflationary pressure, mitigate supply chain challenges and optimize supply for our customers.  BD 2025 continues to serve as our true north and is proving to be the right strategy to reinvent and transform health care now and positions us to continue to deliver strong performance in the years to come. This is evident in our year-to-date results and the proof points of our performance, which include: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times. First, we've strengthened our growth profile as evidenced by our accelerating performance over the past 2 years. In part, this reflects the durability of our COR products as BD is often referred to as the backbone of health care. Our durable COR remains in high demand and creates a stable business, particularly in times of uncertainty.  Second, we've been enhancing our growth by reshaping our portfolio through our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A and the embecta spin, all increasing BD's waiting in higher growth spaces. Our investments in innovation are targeted across 3 irreversible forces that we believe will continue to transform health care over the next 10-plus years in the areas of smart connected care, the shift in new care settings and improving outcomes for patients with chronic disease. In fact, over 60% of our R&D is now invested in these high-growth areas.  Third, we've taken actions to improve our margin profile. This includes simplifying our business by reducing complexities and increasing efficiencies through initiatives like Project RECODE. Through RECODE, we're simplifying our portfolio to optimize our mix, enabling plant efficiency and producing more of the products most critical to our customers. We started this work in mid-FY '20 as part of our BD2025 strategy, and it's been a critical contributor to navigating and performing in this challenging environment. Fourth, we've built significant balance sheet flexibility that has enabled our disciplined capital deployment strategy to support our investments in growth, while also returning capital to shareholders. For example, with the close of the Parata acquisition, 90% of our M&A spend over the past 2 years has been in transformative solutions. Fifth, we continue to execute during uncertain times. By successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we're distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to deliver strong performance in today's environment. Let me share some examples of these macro factors that are impacting health care and what BD has been focused on to stay ahead of the curve. While our industry continues to face supply chain constraints and increased inflationary pressure, we determined early on that we would be best-in-class in navigating the environment and not take a wait-and-see approach.  Over the past 2-plus years, we made investments to institutionalize improvements in supply chain resilience, which are having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability. For example, we've continued our long-standing investments to systematically validate secondary suppliers for our most critical products. We've made additional investments to increase inventory to secure availability of critical raw materials and componentry.  This includes chips that have allowed us to deliver strong growth in areas such as BDB instruments. And we're contracting directly with shippers to ensure continuity of supply for our customers. These capabilities are now embedded in our operating principles, and our teams are doing an extremely good job navigating the environment and largely offsetting these pressures.  Regarding China. While the impact from restrictions lasted longer into Q3, our recovery has been faster than anticipated with a strong rebound in June. Beyond the recovery of hospital patient flow, we initiated several actions to continue manufacturing and keep warehousing largely operational by working closely with our stakeholders in China to help secure key logistics capacity for ourselves and our suppliers.  I'd like to thank a number of BD China associates, who made exceptional sacrifices to ensure product supply for our customers. As a result of the team's efforts, we expect continued strength in China in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we're on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth, assuming no additional waves occur. Finally, there's talk of constrained capital spending amidst recessionary concerns. And as a reminder, BD's revenue base is 85% recurring. As it relates to revenue generated by capital spending, BD is well positioned with only a small percentage of our revenues attributed to capital placements or instruments. In addition, in terms of hospital CapEx, we have seen many of our solutions prioritized due to the role in delivering patient outcomes, while addressing acute challenges, such as optimizing nursing workflow and reducing labor costs. These proof points are a reflection of how our BD2025 strategy and the actions we have taken uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong results. I'll now provide more detail on the progress we are making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. We continue to drive very strong R&D execution and deliver on the exciting opportunities in our pipeline, achieving over 90% year-to-date on both our critical milestones and launches, which is well into top quartile performance within our industry.  Our increased investments in strong execution and organic innovation continue to contribute to our performance. Recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include the commercialization of the IntelliVault Controlled Substance Management System, which is part of the BD Pyxis RapidRx Solutions family that extends our connected medication management offering across new care settings. That's a $700 million space growing about 10%. IntelliVault is an RFID-enabled pharmacy automation solution that provides storage and prescription filling of controlled substance medications, while reducing outpatient pharmacy labor costs. Additionally, in Q3, we received FDA approval for the BD COR MX module and a CT/GC/TV2 molecular assay on BD COR, meeting the milestones we disclosed on the Q2 call. Clearance of this assay in the U.S. gives BD access to the STI testing category, which is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR to $600 million by 2025. Overall, BD COR enables entry into the high-volume molecular diagnostics segment, which is expected to grow at a 9% CAGR to a $2.9 billion served market space by 2025. Our team has already received our first U.S. orders for the new BD COR and is getting very positive customer feedback. With COVID being a more endemic condition, we continue to expand our offering and have received CE Mark and launched combination respiratory panels on both BD COR and BD MAX for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens from one sample. In BD Interventional, we received 510(k) clearance and launched the Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system in the U.S., also meeting the milestone we disclosed on the Q2 call. Customer feedback has been very positive, and there have already been several successful cases to date since launch.  During Q3, we completed the relaunch of the Venovo venous stent in the U.S. and Europe. And last month, we launched for the first time in China. We're seeing strong demand and gaining share with Venovo driven by best-in-class clinical performance data.  Beyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. We received 510(k) clearance for BD PosiFlush SafeScrub. This is a prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, which is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. This is the first innovation in flush syringes in nearly a decade, and it's a really good example of how we're driving innovation to extend leadership in our durable COR in a $900 million addressable space. We expect to launch PosiFlush SafeScrub in the first half of fiscal '23. In our flow cytometry business, our research reagents platforms continue to be a key driver with double-digit growth in this category. Innovation and new product development are helping to fuel research reagents growth as customers continually seek to better understand human biology in the very complex immune system through new and novel experiments.  We continue to advance our innovation programs and are on track to launch more than 1,500 new flow cytometry reagent SKUs this year. The majority of these new products will expand our menu of fast-growing Sirigen reagents as well as our recently launched BD Horizon real yellow dies, allowing our customers to run higher parameter experiments with more reagent choice and flexibility. Finally, PureWick Male is the next new product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. And it's now authorized for release, and we're on track to launch this quarter. PureWick Male will provide nurses with a noninvasive option for urine management in men, enabling earlier Foley catheter removal and resulting in reduced risk of infection. Now as you're well aware, our strategy is driven by strong execution of both organic innovation and disciplined tuck-in M&A. And over this fiscal year, we continued to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and have committed over $2 billion to the completion of 6 acquisitions. A great example of our M&A playbook is our acquisition of Parata Systems completed just last month. Parata allows us to enter the new area of high-growth pharmacy automation in the U.S. and marks an important step towards advancing our BD2025 growth strategy around smart connected care and enabling new care settings. Parata's portfolio of innovative pharmacy automation solutions powers a growing network of pharmacies to reduce costs, enhance patient safety and improve the patient experience. By automating the more routine work within a pharmacy and implementing intelligent workflow solutions, pharmacists can focus more of their time on higher-value clinical work to improve medication adherence, patient safety and outcomes.  And we're seeing macro trends across the industry accelerating and growing demand for pharmacy automation solutions, such as Parata's. These trends include the centralization of pharmacy services in large fulfillment centers and increased clinical demands on pharmacists and hospital and retail settings. And of course, we're seeing increased wage inflation, labor attrition and a large percentage of pharmacists reporting burnout. And taken all together, these trends are driving a $600 million pharmacy automation market opportunity today that's expected to grow approximately 10% annually to a $1.5 billion opportunity in 10 years, and that's just in the U.S. alone. Parata's offering is complementary to our solutions in medication management. And together with BD, we expect Parata Solutions to outpace market growth as we leverage our commercial footprint, global scale and innovation capabilities. Not only is Parata a strong strategic fit, but the company has an attractive financial profile that meets all of our rigorous investment criteria on growth, profitability and returns.  The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. And it exceeds BD's 2025 sales growth and margin targets, thus enhancing the company's ability to achieve its long-range outlook. Given our current financial profile, we'll continue to deploy capital in a disciplined way to create value through tuck-in M&A. Now beyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact towards improving outcomes for patients and providers.  Now before I turn it over to Chris, let me share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 2021 ESG report, which highlights our first performance measurements and progress on our 2030 ESG commitments. This includes launching a sustainable medical technology institute, joining the race to 0 and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy and much more. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact. We're also proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we're recognized as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year. We achieved a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, demonstrating our progress in removing barriers and creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In addition, we are also named as a Noteworthy Company for the third straight year in DiversityInc.'s annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity.  In summary, our BD2025 strategy continues to serve as our true north, allowing us to demonstrate: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times. With another strong quarter, our year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase guidance, and we remain well positioned in the future to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q3 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, the investments we are making in inventory, transportation, portfolio simplification and innovation are also enabling our growth and our ability to deliver our critical health care offerings to our customers and their patients. We continue to deliver strong performance, while simultaneously managing the persistent macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. Through this balanced approach and the effectiveness of our BD2025 strategy, we're making strong progress against both our short- and long-term commitments.  So turning to our revenue performance. We delivered $4.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter, with strong base business growth of 9.3% or 8.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Importantly, however, we are benefiting from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points this quarter. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable COR portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we're bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. Price contributed 190 basis points to growth year-to-date. While this continues to be well below inflationary levels, it's one of many factors that is ensuring we can deliver our health care offerings to our customers. COVID-only testing revenues were $76 million, which is expected to decline from $300 million last year. Year-to-date, COVID-only testing revenues were $475 million. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during this uncertain environment is reflected in the performance across our segments with both Medical and Interventional growing 7.9% and Life Sciences base revenues growing 13.2%.  Total company base business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the U.S., Greater Asia, excluding China, and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in Europe. Despite the COVID-driven restrictions, we grew low single digits in China.  Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.2 billion in revenues in the third quarter, growing 7.9%, driven by strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Delivery Solutions businesses. MDS revenues increased 6.4%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable COR products. Performance in MDS reflects continued competitive gains in catheters and momentum in our comprehensive Vascular Access Management strategy despite the challenging environment in China during the quarter. Performance in MDS also reflects higher hospital utilization levels year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe. MMS revenues grew 3.6%. In our dispensing business, strong growth was driven by continued customer adoption of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation solutions. Worldwide performance in our infusion business was about flat with a similar level of demand in the U.S. for pumps under medical necessity compared to the prior year. Pharm Systems revenues grew 16.3%, driven by the continued acceleration of demand for prefilled devices for biologic drugs and our strong leadership position that is being supported by our ongoing capacity expansion and supply availability. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter. The decline of 5.1% year-over-year is due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 13.2% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences despite supply constraints and the impact from restrictions in China.  IDS revenues declined 10.5%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing, partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 12.8%. Performance in our IDS base business was driven by continued adoption of our broader respiratory panel as well as strong growth in IVD assays, leveraging our increased BD MAX install base. IDS base revenues were also driven by continued demand for specimen management products with strong growth in our durable COR products aided by price management. Biosciences revenues increased 14.2%, reflecting continued strong demand for reagents, driven by our antibody and dye strategy and continued adoption of our e-commerce platform. Performance in Biosciences also reflect strong instrument growth driven by recently launched products and strategic procurement of critical components that enabled us to fill orders to relieve some of the backlog from the end of Q2.  BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the third quarter growing 7.9% with strong performance across the segment. Revenue growth of 6.4% in Surgery reflects strong worldwide performance in advanced repair and reconstruction, driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold and the revenue contribution from the Tepha acquisition. Performance also reflects double-digit growth in biosurgery.  Revenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 9.1%. Strong performance reflects competitive gains driven by Venovo's return to the market and continued global penetration of Rotarex and the acquisition of Venclose expanding our focus across chronic disease settings. Partial backorder recovery also contributed to performance in the quarter, offsetting the impact on deferrable procedures from macroeconomic factors, such as labor constraints. Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in the acute care and alternative care settings. Strength in acute care was also aided by some backorder recovery.  Now moving to our P&L. In Q3, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations, with adjusted net income of $786 million or 14.2% reported growth and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.66 or 16.7% reported growth. As we anticipated on a year-over-year basis, margins improved significantly. We delivered base business gross margin of 52.9%, up 180 basis points and base operating margin of 22.2%, up 450 basis points year-over-year. Base operating margin includes a favorable impact of approximately 75 basis points from an employee benefit-related item that has a related negative offset in our other income and expense line and thus is neutral to our adjusted EPS.  Q3 base gross margin increased in line with our expectations. Key drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives, such as mix optimization and price management, along with increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. These actions enabled us to offset the impact of inflation and deliver margin improvement. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP this quarter as it flowed through sales.  Q3 base operating margin reflects very strong operating expense leverage with base SG&A as a percent of sales, leveraging by about 200 basis points, excluding the employee benefit-related item, partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in shipping. R&D of 6.2% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Our tax rate in Q3 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that occurred in the quarter. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $1.5 billion year-to-date. Q3 cash flow from operations reflects a higher-than-normal inventory balance by about $400 million as we continued our strategic investments in raw materials, such as electronic components as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. During Q3, we paid down approximately $500 million in debt and ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $2.6 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7x.  In addition, we are pleased by our recent debt upgrades from both Moody's and Fitch, which reflect the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on cash flow provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework in support of our BD2025 growth strategy.  Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, some macro considerations that support our guidance. Our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Our guidance also assumes there are no prolonged and larger scale restrictions and countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of any new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients.  Regarding China, specifically, we expect continued recovery from the recent restrictions over the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, while we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure in Q4, we are not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds.  Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We have increased and narrowed both our revenue and EPS ranges. We now expect base revenues to grow 8.75% to 9.25% on an FX-neutral basis. This is an increase of 125 basis points at the midpoint from our previous guidance of 7.25% to 8.25% growth. 100 basis points of the increase is driven by strong growth and continued momentum in our base business. Additionally, with the closure of Parata, we're increasing our forecast by 25 basis points. For COVID-only testing, we now assume up to $500 million in revenue. This reflects year-to-date revenues of $475 million and minimal additional revenue in Q4 as testing demand has slowed as expected.  Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 225 basis points or about $425 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of about 25 basis points or approximately $50 million compared to our prior guidance and is primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. All in, we are increasing our total reported revenue guidance by $190 million at the midpoint to a range of $18.75 billion to $18.83 billion.  We now expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 275 basis points, over 19.6% in fiscal '21. This is an increase of 25 basis points compared to our prior guidance and solely reflects the Q3 employee benefit-related item that has a corresponding negative adjustment to other income and expense and is neutral to adjusted EPS. Despite this challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures. A few additional items for your models. We now expect approximately $30 million in year-over-year improvement in interest/other compared to our prior guidance of $60 million to $75 million. This reduction reflects the offsetting impact to the Q3 employee benefit item that was recorded in G&A. Again, these items are neutral to adjusted EPS. We have narrowed our expected effective tax rate to a range of 13.5% to 14% from 13.5% to 14.5% previously.  Our updated guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume a material change in shares outstanding. Altogether, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $11.28 to $11.35 compared to $11.15 to $11.30 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.09 at the midpoint.  This reflects our strong Q3 base business revenue performance and increased outlook in Q4 and a margin profile that maintains our full year margin improvement commitments. We expect minimal impact from incremental COVID-only testing revenues as we intend to reinvest that to support our momentum into 2023. We still expect margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins for the full fiscal year. Additionally, while the Parata acquisition has an accretive margin profile, the income is expected to be offset by onetime deal-related costs.  Regarding FX, based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect minimal incremental impact as incremental translational FX headwinds are expected to be offset by favorable FX on inventory flow through. As you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. Starting with base growth in Q4, we increased our organic growth and expect strong mid-single-digit growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions, above the 5.5% plus targeted growth profile we outlined at our Investor Day.  This includes absorbing the impact of a difficult prior year comparison in Q4 of fiscal year '21 where the delta variant's surge drove high acuity and demand for infusion sets and products used in the care of COVID. Additionally, we delivered initial shipments of our combination flu COVID assays and benefited from the normalization of lab utilization and research activity. We also have a tough comparison to $316 million of COVID-only testing revenue in Q4 of last year as we expect minimal additional revenues this year with the decline in testing.  Regarding margins, we expect sequential improvement in base gross margins and at a level near year-to-date gross margin of 53.8%. While the impact of increased inflation on our business is expected to continue, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives. Regarding base operating margins, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. Sequentially, the improvement is driven by gross margin as well as continued strong leverage in selling and G&A and slightly lower R&D expense. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest in R&D at about 6% of sales.  While it is premature to provide guidance for fiscal year '23, especially in a macro environment that remains uncertain, we recognize that offering a more proactive perspective during this time is helpful. To begin, while we expect macro challenges to persist, we are not assuming they worsen and would anticipate that as we move towards the back end of the year, there may be some modest relief from some of the current supply chain complexity. We will reassess the environment ahead of providing guidance in November.  So with that caveat, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, which, based on current spot rates, would be a headwind to consider for next year, we remain confident in the strong value-creating framework we outlined at our Investor Day and expect to deliver 5.5% plus base revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This framework continues to be supported by a strong growth profile and continued margin improvement.  We expect the COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings would be at a level significantly below FY '22 and more likely at a run rate similar to the implied Q4 FY '22 or approximately $100 million for the full year. We will have a positive contribution from the full year benefit of revenue and income from Parata that will partially offset the reduced COVID testing.  So importantly, despite the anticipated reduction in COVID-only testing, on an all-in basis, we would expect adjusted EPS to be right around double-digit growth, which implies very strong double-digit base adjusted EPS growth. Based on what we see, it appears current external thinking largely reflects this. We will share more details regarding FY '23 on our year-end earnings call in November.  In closing, we are very pleased with our strong performance to date and the consistency of execution against our strategy that is enabling these results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders. With that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments.\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Chris. Our BD2025 strategy is proving to be an effective winning strategy as reflected in the proof points of our execution and our continued strong performance. We expect continued momentum and remain well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.  Before we turn to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Simon in his new role as the Head of the Medical segment and thank Alberto Mas for an exemplary nearly 30-year career at BD. We expect to announce Simon's successor in BD Interventional soon.  I'd also like to welcome Rishi Grover, our new EVP and Chief Integrated Supply Chain Officer. Rishi brings more than 20 years of experience in manufacturing and supply chain roles, and we're thrilled to have him join our executive leadership team. Rishi succeeds Alex Conroy, who will be retiring after more than 30 years at BD. I'd like to thank Alex for his contributions to BD throughout his career that include a vast array of roles and responsibilities. Most notably and recently, Alex led the organization through unprecedented challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain crisis.  For the purpose of today's Q&A session, Chris will take financials, Dave will answer life science questions, Simon will address BDI, and I will take BD Medical. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congratulations on another strong quarter here. So Tom and Chris, I wanted to just ask about 2023, a couple of follow-up questions and one on pricing. So Chris, on 2023, could you just talk about, is that base sales growth of 5.5% plus, is that organic? How much do you think at this current rates FX would impact sales and EPS? And what's assumed for Alaris returning to the market? And I just had one follow-up on pricing.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Let me -- maybe why don't we first start just with a quick comment on the Alaris, which we'll do one upfront and then I can walk you through the 2023.\nThomas Polen: Larry, this is Tom. Thanks for the good questions. So first off, just overall on '23, as you heard from Chris, we feel really good about our overall position for '23. And obviously, Chris gave some very specific color on that today. It is still early though, and we're not going to get into any specific product assumptions today. We'll click down into that level on our regular Q4 guidance call.  But specific to Alaris, really no change to what we've shared before. Alaris remains our #1 priority. We're confident in the resources that we've invested in our submission and the team and the leadership that we have working on this. And we're focused on making sure that we get all the information to the FDA that's required to get clearance on that product. And so no change from that as -- again, as we think about the Q4 and guide for '23, we'll share more, but we're not going to get any product line details at this time.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. And so I'll build on some of the comments that we made in the opening comments. So first, as we think of 2023, we certainly know there's still a lot of uncertainty that remains in the marketplace. We actually wanted to try and get some context because we know there's questions out there. One, obviously, we have significantly strong growth profile in '22, right? Our guide would apply on an organic basis about 8.25% growth when you strip out Parata.  So folks, we knew there was questions about how you're going to cycle over that growth? Can you still deliver at your 5.5% plus? In addition to that, we knew there was sort of the open question as it related to COVID testing? And how do you think of that dynamic? And what it may do in terms of your earnings profile? So I think with that as a backdrop, we wanted to just reaffirm. We're extremely confident in our 5.5% plus growth profile that we outlined. Actually, I think an interesting way to think of that is if you do kind of 2-year math, it would imply a growth rate of about 7% '22 to '23.  So any way you look at that, it's a really strong base growth profile. We do see the impact of COVID-only testing dropping significantly as we said. We're planning for roughly $25 million kind of this quarter based on what we said and kind of see that more as a more normalized run rate. Obviously, if there's upside to that, it provides that embedded hedge to our portfolio that we've always talked about. So that will be a headwind that gets contemplated. With that said, you see the power of our capital allocation strategy going to work. We're pleased to announce the closing of the Parata acquisition. So that will be an offsetting element against the COVID-only revenue. That is not part of the 5.5% plus. So you think that the 5.5% plus as pure organic. We always said we're not reliant on the onetime lift from tuck-in M&A. And when we do benefit as part of that strategy is the organic lift we get as we cycle and anniversary those acquisitions. And then from an earnings profile, we're committed to the double-digit base adjusted EPS earnings growth. I think importantly though, the most important thing that we share, despite that, kind of COVID-only headwind, we think we can get right about a double-digit adjusted EPS growth profile as well on an all-in basis given the strength of the business, and we'll continue to drive margin improvement into next year.  All of that, obviously, we always think and talk about guidance on an FX-neutral basis. So it doesn't contemplate the currency that we've been talking about. That will impact every company. We're not different in that regard. I can try and help give you a little bit of context, obviously, as we set the year. But one simple way to think about it is euro is the predominant currency that has changed and impacted BD certainly.  If you look at the change from '21 to '22 where currently we've talked about a $425 million headwind, the percentage change in the euro from '21 to '22 is exactly the same as the current average rate we're planning in '22 to the current spot rate at 1 02, which would imply basically a similar kind of year-over-year headwind on currency. I think you're going to do some sort of margin drop-through on that. For BD, the margin tends to drop through at a lower rate given mix of business and other dynamics. With that said, I do think it's important to think of underlying as the most important metric on an FX-neutral basis, right? We're still generating that local cash. We have a very efficient cash allocation model, and we'll be able to put that cash to work. So all in all, I think with where we are with '22, it's a great year. We're on track to finish out a very strong year. And I think you can see based on what we share, we feel confident having momentum going into 2023.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Right. That's super helpful. Given the time here, I'll drop there. I appreciate the comprehensive answer, guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: I'll limit myself to just one question, maybe a two-parter. One, on fiscal '23, the 5.5% organic, that does not include Parata, correct? And Chris, when you said double-digit EPS, that's on a reported basis? I just want to confirm. When you look at free cash flows year-to-date, it's been trending in below. I know there's some inventory buildup. Anything else that's going on in the free cash line item?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, just to confirm, the 5.5% plus does not include Parata. Our commitment that we outlined in Investor Day, again, you always run the business on an operational basis and think of operational commitments. So both a double-digit commitment on base revenues and then what we just shared here despite the COVID only grow over, given the drop in COVID-only revenue, we're confident in right about a double-digit growth profile on an all-in basis as well, which is a great signal on the strength of our total business and the continued momentum we have as it relates to margin improvement that we've committed to as well. If you remember, we committed to about 25% through the 2025 period. We shared that last quarter.  As it relates to FX, again, this is going to apply to any company. Actually, we've been absorbing currency this year, but those commitments we make are always on an FX-neutral basis. You will have to adjust for revenue, and there will be some translational drop-through on that, that would have to be contemplated as you think of the final growth rate. But we need to wait and see where FX lands.  But again, that's not different from anyone, and it doesn't impact your -- it's certainly not reflective of your underlying business. And it doesn't impact the underlying cash that you've earned locally. And we have a capital deployment model that we'll continue to put that to work to continue to drive our strategy as it relates to tuck-in M&A and other things. So we're feeling really good about that growth profile.  Regarding free cash flow, there's been a -- there's really 3 big dynamics. We remain extremely focused on cash. Remember, there's a few ways to look at us. One, we committed to a net leverage ratio of around 2.5x. We're right at 2.7x now. We've been executing on our M&A strategy. So you can see we're putting that at work. We paid down debt as well, consistent with what we shared as part of the embecta spin. So we continue to execute against our capital allocation strategy. In addition to that, on the strength of the business and a disciplined approach we've applied to the balance sheet and how we're navigating that, we did get 2 debt rating upgrades this past quarter. So that was great to see. There are some differences in cash flow. The biggest difference is really just the year-over-year nuances as it relates to COVID-only testing and losing the higher base on COVID-only testing. There was also we also funded the pension. You can see that in the Q.  And then the third thing that we talked about as well is the one trade-off we've made intentionally is investing in inventory. And there's about a $400 million investment we're making there that I would call outsized inventory levels, driven by 3 factors. One of the most critical ones, of course, is procuring strategic components, raw materials, et cetera, to enable the strong growth profile. As you can imagine, there's still long lead times. We have a very efficient supply chain. And a lot of our product is spending time not in the plants, but rather on the water, so to speak, getting to customers. So we've made that investment.  And you do have -- everyone will have inflation kind of flow-through inventory as well. So we're not different in that regard as well. That explains the free cash flow. We remain very focused on that. We're going to continue to look at inventory. But in the short term, I think it's a prudent trade-off and is an enabler to these strong results.\nThomas Polen: And Vijay, this is Tom. Just to add to Chris' comment on that. We view that increase in the inventory levels impact on cash flow. We call it transitory in nature. That's a strategic investment. But as we see supply chain stabilize, we can back off on that additional inventory. As shipping times, transit times, get back to a more normalized level, right, it's going to be more than a month additional nowadays. To get product, let's say, from Asia to the U.S., right, as that normalizes, that will naturally pull back inventory levels as well. And so we see that just as a temporary investment to help navigate the very dynamic circumstance that exists today. But we already have the plans on starting to pull that down as we look ahead.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Tom. Congrats on the [indiscernible].\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start, Chris, just maybe walk us through some of the drivers of operating margin expansion next year. I realize you're not giving exact numbers. But the base business has been sequentially down just a little bit each quarter in fiscal '22. With next year, how do we think about the drivers of that margin expansion?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So first, as it relates to this year, the margin has played out exactly as planned. As a matter of fact, year-to-date, we're sitting at basically 80% of our full year goal, that 250 basis points where we actually increased our margin improvement more to account for, call it, an accounting dynamic and reclass of line related to employee benefits. But we remain well on track.  We did explain at this quarter as it relates to GP specifically, would be the low watermark as you think of timing dynamics, in particular, the outsized inflation that started at the beginning of the year, how that rolls through inventory. And then from the time we started the year, things have only gotten a lot more complex. Inflation increased and supply chain complexity increased, which also increased things such as transportation, et cetera.  So as we've come into the year, just to maybe give you a little bit of context on margin, there's probably been about 100 basis points of -- to our P&L as it relates to outsized inflation above what we contemplated coming into the year given the additional complexity. It's about a 50% increase from what we originally planned. Despite all that, we're still holding our margin commitment for the year, which is really strong.  As you think of the components this year, and I share that because it will play into next year as well, our volume leverage we talked about coming into the year was supposed to be about 100 basis points. Given the strong revenue growth profile, we've done stronger there. That's been part of navigating the outsized inflation on the other end that I just articulated.  And then really beyond that, it's been cost improvement programs that we've dug into and enhanced. We've also been delivering our portfolio actions. There's multiple components to that one. Given the strong growth profile, right, we've been able to be more aggressive with navigating portfolio mix and simplifying our portfolio. We have price management as part of that, that we're fully executing against, which is a very strong. And then the third component to navigate this year has really been, again, on the strong growth profile, the leverage we're experiencing in operating margin and selling and G&A.  So as you think of '23, it's going to be all those same levers. You don't navigate this complexity doing just one thing. We certainly -- with another strong growth profile, we'd expect leverage in terms of volume flowing through our plants. We'll continue to drive a strong CIP agenda. We'll start to get more benefit from the SKU rationalization program as part of Project RECODE we talked about. You'll start getting early benefit from some of the architecture simplification work we also talked about. And you'll certainly continue to get more leverage on the operating margin with the strong growth profile on sales and G&A. In addition to that, we've always talked about kind of the simplification principle beyond just supply chain. And we're looking to also drive simplification through all of our functions. So that will also help. So we continue to build an inventory of things that we're doing that give us confidence as we move into '23. And then, again, maybe just a reminder for everyone, our goal is to get to about 25% by 2025. It implies roughly 100 basis points per year after 2022.  And if you think of that, kind of normally, you would probably just do that on a ratable basis. I think you can anticipate 2023 under-indexing that 100 basis points given you're going to have the rollover of this outsized inflation. And then on the back end, towards '25, you'll get more of the full benefits from Project RECODE. And we also talked about the leverage you get from Alaris coming back.  So those things will give you a slight lift in, call it, '24, '25. And '23 will probably slightly under-indexed versus kind of that 100 basis points equally, but it will still improve year-over-year.\nRobert Marcus: That's really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Your pricing, I think you said 190 bps positive is one of the best, if not the best, in large-cap med tech. How sustainable is that? Do we think of that as you're able to take that as a onetime? Or is this the new normal on pricing as we move forward into subsequent years?\nThomas Polen: I'll take that, Robbie. So just as we think about inflation, and Chris hit a lot of the things that we do to offset that pricing just being one and the last thing that we look at. We put an inflation task force in well over a year ago, recognizing what we saw was going to be inflation this year, and we expect to continue to be inflation in '23. And so just to make that clear, we've done a ton looking at and taking action around improving our own internal continuous improvement within our plants, restructuring our organization, getting costs out within that, looking at our supply chain and how we get costs out there and taking action, and we're seeing those things come through. It's helping our margin.  And we are -- as part of that, where we can offset those internally, we do pass on pricing. We do expect to continue to drive very large significant actions within BD to offset inflation as we look ahead. But we'll continue also where we can't fully offset that to continue to pass that through in price. And we do that in all markets around the world and across all business areas.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Great quarter. I did want to put a finer point on '23 [indiscernible] margin around [indiscernible]...\nThomas Polen: Travis, you're breaking up. We can't hear you very well.\nTravis Steed: All right. Can you hear me now? Is that better?\nThomas Polen: Yes, keep speaking.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Sure. Sorry about that. So just put a finer point on some of the FY '23 comments. I was getting around $12 in earnings for FY '23, just to make sure that's the right ballpark. And on the 100 basis points inflation versus prior expectations, talk a little bit about what's changed there. And to think through like the total inflation impact you're absorbing this year, is that closer to 150 to 200 basis points, $400 million to $500 million? Just trying to think about if there is some relief what the opportunity could be on that front.\nThomas Polen: Maybe we want to start with the $12 commentary. Chris, I'll turn that to you.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. I think as it relates to kind of sharing any specifics on a number, we wouldn't do that for sure. I think we laid out the framework that's pretty clear. We did say that we, of course, look and are aware of kind of external thinking and the time coming into this print, it seemed reasonable knowing that folks would not have contemplated the carryover on currency. Anyway, that's -- I don't think there's much more to add there. I would just go back to, again, the commitment on the 5.5% plus growth profile, double-digit adjusted EPS growth on the base and even having confidence of right around double-digit growth, adjusting for the drop-down of the COVID-only testing.\nThomas Polen: And Travis, on your comment around what changed as we went through the year. I think very similar to what probably every business around the world and particularly in the U.S. would have seen we recognized and we took the position very early on well over a year ago, again, that there was going to be no company that escapes inflation and no company that escapes supply chain challenges, and we've been taking action to that extent. Those challenges, labor became more expensive as you went through the year, right, particularly in areas, like manufacturing, where there were shortages and you had to pay more to get talent to run plants. Think about as you saw low watermarks for unemployment, trying to staff, for example, overnight shift. When now there's tons of jobs for people to work day shift, having to change that in all of our plants, which we pretty much run most of our plants 24/7. Shipping continued to increase as we went through the year, and you saw that as well. Things like power significantly, as you can imagine, we use tons of power in our manufacturing plants running large presses, et cetera. Those costs went up as well.  And so those were general inflationary pressures that you saw across the country, very much in line with inflation continued to go up as we went through the year just versus everyone's expectations, and that certainly we didn't escape any business. And so what was maybe starting the year towards that 150, 200 basis point headwind ended up being more of a 250 or so as Chris mentioned.  And again, we are really pleased with the team's work to overcome all of that and still deliver on our expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. I think that really speaks to the power of the strategic planning that the team has done, the strong execution and the foresight to make investments in areas like the strategic inventory builds that we did and navigate a very challenging environment.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Just one other frame for everyone because I know you're all navigating. Things have changed a lot from the start of the year to where we are. And when you think of that through the lens of BD, there's really been 2 key things that have changed, one kind of a macro factor, right? When we started our initial guide and talked about what the year would be like we were contemplating pretty significant outsized inflation.  As the year progressed, whether it be the conflict in Ukraine and Russia, the COVID China shutdown, the complexity only grew. Inflation grew, as I noted earlier on the call. And the supply chain complexity increased. So again, about a 50% increase on what we originally contemplated about a 100 basis point headwind.  Then when you think of what's happened from BD. Our initial guide, when you kind of restate everything for embecta, we were at 6%. We're sitting here at 9% at the midpoint, right? That's 300 basis points or about $0.5 billion. So with more complexity, we've actually strengthened our growth profile and overcome all of those headwinds. And then I know there's a lot of puts and takes quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, there was also on the revenue side. Outsized COVID testing, we benefited from. That took our number up $300 million. But when you look at the EPS drop-through, it was north of $0.60 from the beginning of the year, inclusive of absorbing FX headwinds. And when you look at that then and think of what we've done from a margin standpoint, we've delivered exactly what we can actually slightly above our commitment. So we absorbed $100 million -- 100 basis points of headwind on the cost side, delivered outside performance as we've headed through the year on top line and fully held our margin commitment both on the base and EPS.  So I know there's lots of puts and takes as you go through the quarter. Even tax as an example, when you restate our guide for the initial tax, it would have been 13% to 14% ex embecta. We're now 13.5% to 14%. So we know we had some onetime timing items in this quarter, but we're actually absorbing tax pressure as well in those numbers. So you'll have a Q4 true-up, of course, given the timing here. But we're not even benefiting there as you think of kind of updating.  So it's been a very strong year. We're really proud of what everyone has done, our 75,000 employees navigating the complexity during this time and feel good about the momentum we have going into next year.\nTravis Steed: No, that's great. And maybe just one follow-up on the overall hospital environment. You just talk about utilization trends, hospital staffing, capital spending and also the China recovery. Does China return to double-digit growth in FY '23.\nThomas Polen: And just to clarify, great question. We're expecting China, and I think this is really impressive and reflects on the strength of our China team, to still deliver right around double-digit growth this year despite the Shanghai shutdown. And even despite the Shanghai shutdown, we delivered -- we still delivered growth this quarter in China, which I think is an exceptional achievement of our team there. And to reflect on how dynamic of a year there's been for them to still be on track to deliver right around double-digit growth for this full year, again, really reflects a lot of great planning and execution on behalf of our China team.  Why don't I turn it to Simon and Dave to make some colors on utilization kind of on the procedure side and then what we're seeing in the lab side. So we'll start with Simon.\nSimon Campion: So for sure, you mentioned labor. We definitely saw some pressure on labor in Q3. I think it was particularly relevant in the Peripheral Intervention space. But despite that, we still posted really, really robust growth in BDI and PI, in particular, both domestically and internationally. And then just to follow up on Tom's comment on China, we posted in BDI another quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to invest there in Surgery with the Tissuemed acquisition in PI with the recently approved Venovo venous stent in China, which is -- which we've done cases already, and it's gone tremendously well. And we just also recently got approval on the Covera covered stent graft. So anytime we put anything into China, we get a really robust return. And as we've noted before, it's doubled since Bard is acquired by BD, and we look forward to continued robust growth there.\nThomas Polen: Great, Simon.\nDavid Hickey: Yes. Thanks, Tom. And for Life Sciences, similar theme. I mean again, another great quarter for us in terms of double-digit growth. The team continues to execute extremely well both in IDS and BDB. If I think about IDS, one of the best bellwethers or measures we have for utilization is the specimen management business. That was a big growth driver for us in the quarter. So that's a really good indication.  On the BDB side, which I think, as you know, is split into both clinical and research businesses on the -- as Tom mentioned, the Life Science research reagents and instruments and the clinical reagents growth above expectation for us. So just solid returns overall in terms of utilization and growth levers.  On labor, it's interesting. As you sensor some of the labor shortages and challenges within our health care customers might be going, that's where I think we're very well positioned with some of our automation platforms when you think about the slide we had in the back on innovation relative to BD COR that just got approved or the molecular module got approved here in the U.S.  I think if our customers do see headwind with labor shortages, we have fully automated, connected, integrated automated solutions, both for clinical microbiology, the molecular testing that we're just ready and continue to deploy to help our customers address those headwinds.\nThomas Polen: Great. And maybe just to give just a couple of other statistics that we look at, at a macro level and utilization. As we think about Q3 and what we saw versus last year in the U.S. acute care sector, the average trend we saw over -- was about 100% of pre-COVID levels in Q3. That was up just a little bit versus Q2, where we were at -- we saw 98% to 99% of pre-COVID level, so it went up a tick in Q3.  In the non-acute sector, we saw Q3 rates in the non-acute sector, we're slightly over 100% versus pre-COVID, which was also similar to what we saw in the prior quarter of Q2. And then as mentioned, we do see sequential improvements continue to occur as we look ahead.  We do see in certain areas impacts of labor shortages certainly impacting certain procedures. I think the procedures that tend to be in BDI business are less impacted by them. It can be more acute in nature, let's say, putting in a fistula for someone to get dialysis that really becomes a prioritized procedure or getting your vasculature open to prevent an amputation of your leg as another example where that's a priority procedure.  And at the same time as well, David mentioned a lot of fantastic automation solutions in the Life Science sector, but we have the same in BD Medical. And I think a great example of that is the Parata Solution. And if anything, that's become more attractive since we've acquired that. That is the answer to pharmacy labor shortages, and, it is the answer to higher labor costs. It automates routine tasks that can be done by robots and software. And we're seeing really strong demand on that herein as its early days in our hands. So we're really excited to have that as part of BD.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: It's hard to not ask a question about your capital priority thinking updated thoughts from two perspectives, both on the M&A side and the portfolio side. I mean Chris and his team are clearly doing a brilliant job in, I think, driving even more financial flexibility for you to make decisions. And I'm sort of curious, do you feel bolder about thinking about portfolio addition and subtraction generally now given that financial flexibility? And maybe talk about your thoughts, do you feel like, given the current environment and the market and valuations, are there more opportunities? Could we see your tuck-in strategy accelerate here?\nThomas Polen: Thanks for the good question, Rick. So I just -- I'm going to step back a little bit as we think about our portfolio strategy. And as you mentioned, we've been very active in executing our portfolio strategy, shifting BD into those higher-growth spaces, those 3 transformative solution spaces that you've heard us talk so much about, a smart connected care enabling new care settings and improving outcomes in patients with chronic disease, all high-growth markets that are reshaping the future of health care and where BD will be at the forefront of.  And so some of those portfolio actions that we've been doing over the last couple of years include the spin-off embecta. It also includes 19 tuck-in acquisitions over the last few years. And these are all going very well. I think that's important to also hover up and look at. You heard Chris discuss that those that have already anniversary-ed are adding 30 basis points to our underlying growth today because they're doing well. They're in high-growth markets and they're driving BD's growth rate up. Of course, the spin-off embecta also adds to that growth further.  90% of the M&A that we've done to date, of those 19 deals, 90% of it of the spend has been in transformative solutions spaces, those higher-growth spaces that are reshaping our pipeline. And so as we look ahead, we're certainly going to continue to be very disciplined and focused on executing tuck-in M&A in line with our strategy. And that's doing M&A that's strategically aligned in advancing our leadership and expanding our position in those prioritized high-growth transformative solution spaces that I talked about. Those are deals that are accretive and meet rigorous financial metrics that we have. We've walked away from a lot of deals that don't meet those metrics. We're going to stay disciplined to that. And we're proud of we walk away from that perspective.  And then finally, where we see significant leverage and synergies, and I think that's been a hallmark of all the deals that we've done. They've been able to leverage whether or not it's BD global presence, strong BD commercial channels, strong BD manufacturing or procurement capabilities, to add more value as part of BD than they could stand alone. And that's a core principle that we're going to continue to execute against.  So we certainly have a robust funnel. As we look ahead, we're obviously, in the very near term, very focused on the Parata acquisition execution and making sure that, that's a success. I know, again, we really very much welcome the Parata team to BD. And I know they're excited to be here, and we're seeing really strong early momentum with us having come together. If anything, I would just say expect to probably see a focus on more Parata-cized deals in the future, still very much tuck-in, but along that size versus smaller ones. So and again, we're very active in our funnel management from that perspective. We do see -- we certainly see whether or not in the environment before we've been very active in M&A., we still see many opportunities as we look ahead. Thanks for the question, Rick.\nOperator: There are no further questions. We'll now turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.\nThomas Polen: Okay. Well, I'm going to keep this very brief. It was a great discussion. Thank all of you for the very good questions. We wish you a great rest of the day and a wonderful summer. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's audio webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong Q3 results. We exceeded our revenue, operating margin and earnings goals and delivered another quarter of consistent strong performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 9.3%. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of BD's performance even during an uncertain market environment, with year-to-date base business growth of 9.6%.  I want to thank our team of over 75,000 talented associates, who continue to deliver on the Growth, Simplify and Empower pillars of our BD2025 strategy. Our performance reflects the team's agility and strong execution, which puts us ahead of the curve in our ability to manage inflationary pressure, mitigate supply chain challenges and optimize supply for our customers.  BD 2025 continues to serve as our true north and is proving to be the right strategy to reinvent and transform health care now and positions us to continue to deliver strong performance in the years to come. This is evident in our year-to-date results and the proof points of our performance, which include: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times. First, we've strengthened our growth profile as evidenced by our accelerating performance over the past 2 years. In part, this reflects the durability of our COR products as BD is often referred to as the backbone of health care. Our durable COR remains in high demand and creates a stable business, particularly in times of uncertainty.  Second, we've been enhancing our growth by reshaping our portfolio through our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A and the embecta spin, all increasing BD's waiting in higher growth spaces. Our investments in innovation are targeted across 3 irreversible forces that we believe will continue to transform health care over the next 10-plus years in the areas of smart connected care, the shift in new care settings and improving outcomes for patients with chronic disease. In fact, over 60% of our R&D is now invested in these high-growth areas.  Third, we've taken actions to improve our margin profile. This includes simplifying our business by reducing complexities and increasing efficiencies through initiatives like Project RECODE. Through RECODE, we're simplifying our portfolio to optimize our mix, enabling plant efficiency and producing more of the products most critical to our customers. We started this work in mid-FY '20 as part of our BD2025 strategy, and it's been a critical contributor to navigating and performing in this challenging environment. Fourth, we've built significant balance sheet flexibility that has enabled our disciplined capital deployment strategy to support our investments in growth, while also returning capital to shareholders. For example, with the close of the Parata acquisition, 90% of our M&A spend over the past 2 years has been in transformative solutions. Fifth, we continue to execute during uncertain times. By successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we're distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to deliver strong performance in today's environment. Let me share some examples of these macro factors that are impacting health care and what BD has been focused on to stay ahead of the curve. While our industry continues to face supply chain constraints and increased inflationary pressure, we determined early on that we would be best-in-class in navigating the environment and not take a wait-and-see approach.  Over the past 2-plus years, we made investments to institutionalize improvements in supply chain resilience, which are having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability. For example, we've continued our long-standing investments to systematically validate secondary suppliers for our most critical products. We've made additional investments to increase inventory to secure availability of critical raw materials and componentry.  This includes chips that have allowed us to deliver strong growth in areas such as BDB instruments. And we're contracting directly with shippers to ensure continuity of supply for our customers. These capabilities are now embedded in our operating principles, and our teams are doing an extremely good job navigating the environment and largely offsetting these pressures.  Regarding China. While the impact from restrictions lasted longer into Q3, our recovery has been faster than anticipated with a strong rebound in June. Beyond the recovery of hospital patient flow, we initiated several actions to continue manufacturing and keep warehousing largely operational by working closely with our stakeholders in China to help secure key logistics capacity for ourselves and our suppliers.  I'd like to thank a number of BD China associates, who made exceptional sacrifices to ensure product supply for our customers. As a result of the team's efforts, we expect continued strength in China in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we're on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth, assuming no additional waves occur. Finally, there's talk of constrained capital spending amidst recessionary concerns. And as a reminder, BD's revenue base is 85% recurring. As it relates to revenue generated by capital spending, BD is well positioned with only a small percentage of our revenues attributed to capital placements or instruments. In addition, in terms of hospital CapEx, we have seen many of our solutions prioritized due to the role in delivering patient outcomes, while addressing acute challenges, such as optimizing nursing workflow and reducing labor costs. These proof points are a reflection of how our BD2025 strategy and the actions we have taken uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong results. I'll now provide more detail on the progress we are making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. We continue to drive very strong R&D execution and deliver on the exciting opportunities in our pipeline, achieving over 90% year-to-date on both our critical milestones and launches, which is well into top quartile performance within our industry.  Our increased investments in strong execution and organic innovation continue to contribute to our performance. Recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include the commercialization of the IntelliVault Controlled Substance Management System, which is part of the BD Pyxis RapidRx Solutions family that extends our connected medication management offering across new care settings. That's a $700 million space growing about 10%. IntelliVault is an RFID-enabled pharmacy automation solution that provides storage and prescription filling of controlled substance medications, while reducing outpatient pharmacy labor costs. Additionally, in Q3, we received FDA approval for the BD COR MX module and a CT/GC/TV2 molecular assay on BD COR, meeting the milestones we disclosed on the Q2 call. Clearance of this assay in the U.S. gives BD access to the STI testing category, which is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR to $600 million by 2025. Overall, BD COR enables entry into the high-volume molecular diagnostics segment, which is expected to grow at a 9% CAGR to a $2.9 billion served market space by 2025. Our team has already received our first U.S. orders for the new BD COR and is getting very positive customer feedback. With COVID being a more endemic condition, we continue to expand our offering and have received CE Mark and launched combination respiratory panels on both BD COR and BD MAX for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens from one sample. In BD Interventional, we received 510(k) clearance and launched the Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system in the U.S., also meeting the milestone we disclosed on the Q2 call. Customer feedback has been very positive, and there have already been several successful cases to date since launch.  During Q3, we completed the relaunch of the Venovo venous stent in the U.S. and Europe. And last month, we launched for the first time in China. We're seeing strong demand and gaining share with Venovo driven by best-in-class clinical performance data.  Beyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. We received 510(k) clearance for BD PosiFlush SafeScrub. This is a prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, which is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. This is the first innovation in flush syringes in nearly a decade, and it's a really good example of how we're driving innovation to extend leadership in our durable COR in a $900 million addressable space. We expect to launch PosiFlush SafeScrub in the first half of fiscal '23. In our flow cytometry business, our research reagents platforms continue to be a key driver with double-digit growth in this category. Innovation and new product development are helping to fuel research reagents growth as customers continually seek to better understand human biology in the very complex immune system through new and novel experiments.  We continue to advance our innovation programs and are on track to launch more than 1,500 new flow cytometry reagent SKUs this year. The majority of these new products will expand our menu of fast-growing Sirigen reagents as well as our recently launched BD Horizon real yellow dies, allowing our customers to run higher parameter experiments with more reagent choice and flexibility. Finally, PureWick Male is the next new product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. And it's now authorized for release, and we're on track to launch this quarter. PureWick Male will provide nurses with a noninvasive option for urine management in men, enabling earlier Foley catheter removal and resulting in reduced risk of infection. Now as you're well aware, our strategy is driven by strong execution of both organic innovation and disciplined tuck-in M&A. And over this fiscal year, we continued to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and have committed over $2 billion to the completion of 6 acquisitions. A great example of our M&A playbook is our acquisition of Parata Systems completed just last month. Parata allows us to enter the new area of high-growth pharmacy automation in the U.S. and marks an important step towards advancing our BD2025 growth strategy around smart connected care and enabling new care settings. Parata's portfolio of innovative pharmacy automation solutions powers a growing network of pharmacies to reduce costs, enhance patient safety and improve the patient experience. By automating the more routine work within a pharmacy and implementing intelligent workflow solutions, pharmacists can focus more of their time on higher-value clinical work to improve medication adherence, patient safety and outcomes.  And we're seeing macro trends across the industry accelerating and growing demand for pharmacy automation solutions, such as Parata's. These trends include the centralization of pharmacy services in large fulfillment centers and increased clinical demands on pharmacists and hospital and retail settings. And of course, we're seeing increased wage inflation, labor attrition and a large percentage of pharmacists reporting burnout. And taken all together, these trends are driving a $600 million pharmacy automation market opportunity today that's expected to grow approximately 10% annually to a $1.5 billion opportunity in 10 years, and that's just in the U.S. alone. Parata's offering is complementary to our solutions in medication management. And together with BD, we expect Parata Solutions to outpace market growth as we leverage our commercial footprint, global scale and innovation capabilities. Not only is Parata a strong strategic fit, but the company has an attractive financial profile that meets all of our rigorous investment criteria on growth, profitability and returns.  The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. And it exceeds BD's 2025 sales growth and margin targets, thus enhancing the company's ability to achieve its long-range outlook. Given our current financial profile, we'll continue to deploy capital in a disciplined way to create value through tuck-in M&A. Now beyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact towards improving outcomes for patients and providers.  Now before I turn it over to Chris, let me share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 2021 ESG report, which highlights our first performance measurements and progress on our 2030 ESG commitments. This includes launching a sustainable medical technology institute, joining the race to 0 and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy and much more. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact. We're also proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we're recognized as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year. We achieved a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, demonstrating our progress in removing barriers and creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In addition, we are also named as a Noteworthy Company for the third straight year in DiversityInc.'s annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity.  In summary, our BD2025 strategy continues to serve as our true north, allowing us to demonstrate: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times. With another strong quarter, our year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase guidance, and we remain well positioned in the future to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Thanks, Chris. Our BD2025 strategy is proving to be an effective winning strategy as reflected in the proof points of our execution and our continued strong performance. We expect continued momentum and remain well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.  Before we turn to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Simon in his new role as the Head of the Medical segment and thank Alberto Mas for an exemplary nearly 30-year career at BD. We expect to announce Simon's successor in BD Interventional soon.  I'd also like to welcome Rishi Grover, our new EVP and Chief Integrated Supply Chain Officer. Rishi brings more than 20 years of experience in manufacturing and supply chain roles, and we're thrilled to have him join our executive leadership team. Rishi succeeds Alex Conroy, who will be retiring after more than 30 years at BD. I'd like to thank Alex for his contributions to BD throughout his career that include a vast array of roles and responsibilities. Most notably and recently, Alex led the organization through unprecedented challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain crisis.  For the purpose of today's Q&A session, Chris will take financials, Dave will answer life science questions, Simon will address BDI, and I will take BD Medical. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue? Larry, this is Tom. Thanks for the good questions. So first off, just overall on '23, as you heard from Chris, we feel really good about our overall position for '23. And obviously, Chris gave some very specific color on that today. It is still early though, and we're not going to get into any specific product assumptions today. We'll click down into that level on our regular Q4 guidance call.  But specific to Alaris, really no change to what we've shared before. Alaris remains our #1 priority. We're confident in the resources that we've invested in our submission and the team and the leadership that we have working on this. And we're focused on making sure that we get all the information to the FDA that's required to get clearance on that product. And so no change from that as -- again, as we think about the Q4 and guide for '23, we'll share more, but we're not going to get any product line details at this time. And Vijay, this is Tom. Just to add to Chris' comment on that. We view that increase in the inventory levels impact on cash flow. We call it transitory in nature. That's a strategic investment. But as we see supply chain stabilize, we can back off on that additional inventory. As shipping times, transit times, get back to a more normalized level, right, it's going to be more than a month additional nowadays. To get product, let's say, from Asia to the U.S., right, as that normalizes, that will naturally pull back inventory levels as well. And so we see that just as a temporary investment to help navigate the very dynamic circumstance that exists today. But we already have the plans on starting to pull that down as we look ahead. Thanks, Vijay. I'll take that, Robbie. So just as we think about inflation, and Chris hit a lot of the things that we do to offset that pricing just being one and the last thing that we look at. We put an inflation task force in well over a year ago, recognizing what we saw was going to be inflation this year, and we expect to continue to be inflation in '23. And so just to make that clear, we've done a ton looking at and taking action around improving our own internal continuous improvement within our plants, restructuring our organization, getting costs out within that, looking at our supply chain and how we get costs out there and taking action, and we're seeing those things come through. It's helping our margin.  And we are -- as part of that, where we can offset those internally, we do pass on pricing. We do expect to continue to drive very large significant actions within BD to offset inflation as we look ahead. But we'll continue also where we can't fully offset that to continue to pass that through in price. And we do that in all markets around the world and across all business areas. Travis, you're breaking up. We can't hear you very well. Yes, keep speaking. Maybe we want to start with the $12 commentary. Chris, I'll turn that to you. And Travis, on your comment around what changed as we went through the year. I think very similar to what probably every business around the world and particularly in the U.S. would have seen we recognized and we took the position very early on well over a year ago, again, that there was going to be no company that escapes inflation and no company that escapes supply chain challenges, and we've been taking action to that extent. Those challenges, labor became more expensive as you went through the year, right, particularly in areas, like manufacturing, where there were shortages and you had to pay more to get talent to run plants. Think about as you saw low watermarks for unemployment, trying to staff, for example, overnight shift. When now there's tons of jobs for people to work day shift, having to change that in all of our plants, which we pretty much run most of our plants 24/7. Shipping continued to increase as we went through the year, and you saw that as well. Things like power significantly, as you can imagine, we use tons of power in our manufacturing plants running large presses, et cetera. Those costs went up as well.  And so those were general inflationary pressures that you saw across the country, very much in line with inflation continued to go up as we went through the year just versus everyone's expectations, and that certainly we didn't escape any business. And so what was maybe starting the year towards that 150, 200 basis point headwind ended up being more of a 250 or so as Chris mentioned.  And again, we are really pleased with the team's work to overcome all of that and still deliver on our expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. I think that really speaks to the power of the strategic planning that the team has done, the strong execution and the foresight to make investments in areas like the strategic inventory builds that we did and navigate a very challenging environment. And just to clarify, great question. We're expecting China, and I think this is really impressive and reflects on the strength of our China team, to still deliver right around double-digit growth this year despite the Shanghai shutdown. And even despite the Shanghai shutdown, we delivered -- we still delivered growth this quarter in China, which I think is an exceptional achievement of our team there. And to reflect on how dynamic of a year there's been for them to still be on track to deliver right around double-digit growth for this full year, again, really reflects a lot of great planning and execution on behalf of our China team.  Why don't I turn it to Simon and Dave to make some colors on utilization kind of on the procedure side and then what we're seeing in the lab side. So we'll start with Simon. Great, Simon. Great. And maybe just to give just a couple of other statistics that we look at, at a macro level and utilization. As we think about Q3 and what we saw versus last year in the U.S. acute care sector, the average trend we saw over -- was about 100% of pre-COVID levels in Q3. That was up just a little bit versus Q2, where we were at -- we saw 98% to 99% of pre-COVID level, so it went up a tick in Q3.  In the non-acute sector, we saw Q3 rates in the non-acute sector, we're slightly over 100% versus pre-COVID, which was also similar to what we saw in the prior quarter of Q2. And then as mentioned, we do see sequential improvements continue to occur as we look ahead.  We do see in certain areas impacts of labor shortages certainly impacting certain procedures. I think the procedures that tend to be in BDI business are less impacted by them. It can be more acute in nature, let's say, putting in a fistula for someone to get dialysis that really becomes a prioritized procedure or getting your vasculature open to prevent an amputation of your leg as another example where that's a priority procedure.  And at the same time as well, David mentioned a lot of fantastic automation solutions in the Life Science sector, but we have the same in BD Medical. And I think a great example of that is the Parata Solution. And if anything, that's become more attractive since we've acquired that. That is the answer to pharmacy labor shortages, and, it is the answer to higher labor costs. It automates routine tasks that can be done by robots and software. And we're seeing really strong demand on that herein as its early days in our hands. So we're really excited to have that as part of BD. Thanks for the good question, Rick. So I just -- I'm going to step back a little bit as we think about our portfolio strategy. And as you mentioned, we've been very active in executing our portfolio strategy, shifting BD into those higher-growth spaces, those 3 transformative solution spaces that you've heard us talk so much about, a smart connected care enabling new care settings and improving outcomes in patients with chronic disease, all high-growth markets that are reshaping the future of health care and where BD will be at the forefront of.  And so some of those portfolio actions that we've been doing over the last couple of years include the spin-off embecta. It also includes 19 tuck-in acquisitions over the last few years. And these are all going very well. I think that's important to also hover up and look at. You heard Chris discuss that those that have already anniversary-ed are adding 30 basis points to our underlying growth today because they're doing well. They're in high-growth markets and they're driving BD's growth rate up. Of course, the spin-off embecta also adds to that growth further.  90% of the M&A that we've done to date, of those 19 deals, 90% of it of the spend has been in transformative solutions spaces, those higher-growth spaces that are reshaping our pipeline. And so as we look ahead, we're certainly going to continue to be very disciplined and focused on executing tuck-in M&A in line with our strategy. And that's doing M&A that's strategically aligned in advancing our leadership and expanding our position in those prioritized high-growth transformative solution spaces that I talked about. Those are deals that are accretive and meet rigorous financial metrics that we have. We've walked away from a lot of deals that don't meet those metrics. We're going to stay disciplined to that. And we're proud of we walk away from that perspective.  And then finally, where we see significant leverage and synergies, and I think that's been a hallmark of all the deals that we've done. They've been able to leverage whether or not it's BD global presence, strong BD commercial channels, strong BD manufacturing or procurement capabilities, to add more value as part of BD than they could stand alone. And that's a core principle that we're going to continue to execute against.  So we certainly have a robust funnel. As we look ahead, we're obviously, in the very near term, very focused on the Parata acquisition execution and making sure that, that's a success. I know, again, we really very much welcome the Parata team to BD. And I know they're excited to be here, and we're seeing really strong early momentum with us having come together. If anything, I would just say expect to probably see a focus on more Parata-cized deals in the future, still very much tuck-in, but along that size versus smaller ones. So and again, we're very active in our funnel management from that perspective. We do see -- we certainly see whether or not in the environment before we've been very active in M&A., we still see many opportunities as we look ahead. Thanks for the question, Rick. Okay. Well, I'm going to keep this very brief. It was a great discussion. Thank all of you for the very good questions. We wish you a great rest of the day and a wonderful summer. Thank you."

            "name": "Christopher DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q3 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, the investments we are making in inventory, transportation, portfolio simplification and innovation are also enabling our growth and our ability to deliver our critical health care offerings to our customers and their patients. We continue to deliver strong performance, while simultaneously managing the persistent macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. Through this balanced approach and the effectiveness of our BD2025 strategy, we're making strong progress against both our short- and long-term commitments.  So turning to our revenue performance. We delivered $4.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter, with strong base business growth of 9.3% or 8.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Importantly, however, we are benefiting from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points this quarter. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable COR portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we're bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. Price contributed 190 basis points to growth year-to-date. While this continues to be well below inflationary levels, it's one of many factors that is ensuring we can deliver our health care offerings to our customers. COVID-only testing revenues were $76 million, which is expected to decline from $300 million last year. Year-to-date, COVID-only testing revenues were $475 million. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during this uncertain environment is reflected in the performance across our segments with both Medical and Interventional growing 7.9% and Life Sciences base revenues growing 13.2%.  Total company base business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the U.S., Greater Asia, excluding China, and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in Europe. Despite the COVID-driven restrictions, we grew low single digits in China.  Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.2 billion in revenues in the third quarter, growing 7.9%, driven by strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Delivery Solutions businesses. MDS revenues increased 6.4%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable COR products. Performance in MDS reflects continued competitive gains in catheters and momentum in our comprehensive Vascular Access Management strategy despite the challenging environment in China during the quarter. Performance in MDS also reflects higher hospital utilization levels year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe. MMS revenues grew 3.6%. In our dispensing business, strong growth was driven by continued customer adoption of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation solutions. Worldwide performance in our infusion business was about flat with a similar level of demand in the U.S. for pumps under medical necessity compared to the prior year. Pharm Systems revenues grew 16.3%, driven by the continued acceleration of demand for prefilled devices for biologic drugs and our strong leadership position that is being supported by our ongoing capacity expansion and supply availability. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter. The decline of 5.1% year-over-year is due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 13.2% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences despite supply constraints and the impact from restrictions in China.  IDS revenues declined 10.5%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing, partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 12.8%. Performance in our IDS base business was driven by continued adoption of our broader respiratory panel as well as strong growth in IVD assays, leveraging our increased BD MAX install base. IDS base revenues were also driven by continued demand for specimen management products with strong growth in our durable COR products aided by price management. Biosciences revenues increased 14.2%, reflecting continued strong demand for reagents, driven by our antibody and dye strategy and continued adoption of our e-commerce platform. Performance in Biosciences also reflect strong instrument growth driven by recently launched products and strategic procurement of critical components that enabled us to fill orders to relieve some of the backlog from the end of Q2.  BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the third quarter growing 7.9% with strong performance across the segment. Revenue growth of 6.4% in Surgery reflects strong worldwide performance in advanced repair and reconstruction, driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold and the revenue contribution from the Tepha acquisition. Performance also reflects double-digit growth in biosurgery.  Revenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 9.1%. Strong performance reflects competitive gains driven by Venovo's return to the market and continued global penetration of Rotarex and the acquisition of Venclose expanding our focus across chronic disease settings. Partial backorder recovery also contributed to performance in the quarter, offsetting the impact on deferrable procedures from macroeconomic factors, such as labor constraints. Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in the acute care and alternative care settings. Strength in acute care was also aided by some backorder recovery.  Now moving to our P&L. In Q3, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations, with adjusted net income of $786 million or 14.2% reported growth and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.66 or 16.7% reported growth. As we anticipated on a year-over-year basis, margins improved significantly. We delivered base business gross margin of 52.9%, up 180 basis points and base operating margin of 22.2%, up 450 basis points year-over-year. Base operating margin includes a favorable impact of approximately 75 basis points from an employee benefit-related item that has a related negative offset in our other income and expense line and thus is neutral to our adjusted EPS.  Q3 base gross margin increased in line with our expectations. Key drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives, such as mix optimization and price management, along with increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. These actions enabled us to offset the impact of inflation and deliver margin improvement. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP this quarter as it flowed through sales.  Q3 base operating margin reflects very strong operating expense leverage with base SG&A as a percent of sales, leveraging by about 200 basis points, excluding the employee benefit-related item, partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in shipping. R&D of 6.2% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Our tax rate in Q3 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that occurred in the quarter. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $1.5 billion year-to-date. Q3 cash flow from operations reflects a higher-than-normal inventory balance by about $400 million as we continued our strategic investments in raw materials, such as electronic components as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. During Q3, we paid down approximately $500 million in debt and ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $2.6 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7x.  In addition, we are pleased by our recent debt upgrades from both Moody's and Fitch, which reflect the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on cash flow provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework in support of our BD2025 growth strategy.  Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, some macro considerations that support our guidance. Our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Our guidance also assumes there are no prolonged and larger scale restrictions and countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of any new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients.  Regarding China, specifically, we expect continued recovery from the recent restrictions over the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, while we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure in Q4, we are not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds.  Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We have increased and narrowed both our revenue and EPS ranges. We now expect base revenues to grow 8.75% to 9.25% on an FX-neutral basis. This is an increase of 125 basis points at the midpoint from our previous guidance of 7.25% to 8.25% growth. 100 basis points of the increase is driven by strong growth and continued momentum in our base business. Additionally, with the closure of Parata, we're increasing our forecast by 25 basis points. For COVID-only testing, we now assume up to $500 million in revenue. This reflects year-to-date revenues of $475 million and minimal additional revenue in Q4 as testing demand has slowed as expected.  Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 225 basis points or about $425 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of about 25 basis points or approximately $50 million compared to our prior guidance and is primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. All in, we are increasing our total reported revenue guidance by $190 million at the midpoint to a range of $18.75 billion to $18.83 billion.  We now expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 275 basis points, over 19.6% in fiscal '21. This is an increase of 25 basis points compared to our prior guidance and solely reflects the Q3 employee benefit-related item that has a corresponding negative adjustment to other income and expense and is neutral to adjusted EPS. Despite this challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures. A few additional items for your models. We now expect approximately $30 million in year-over-year improvement in interest/other compared to our prior guidance of $60 million to $75 million. This reduction reflects the offsetting impact to the Q3 employee benefit item that was recorded in G&A. Again, these items are neutral to adjusted EPS. We have narrowed our expected effective tax rate to a range of 13.5% to 14% from 13.5% to 14.5% previously.  Our updated guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume a material change in shares outstanding. Altogether, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $11.28 to $11.35 compared to $11.15 to $11.30 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.09 at the midpoint.  This reflects our strong Q3 base business revenue performance and increased outlook in Q4 and a margin profile that maintains our full year margin improvement commitments. We expect minimal impact from incremental COVID-only testing revenues as we intend to reinvest that to support our momentum into 2023. We still expect margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins for the full fiscal year. Additionally, while the Parata acquisition has an accretive margin profile, the income is expected to be offset by onetime deal-related costs.  Regarding FX, based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect minimal incremental impact as incremental translational FX headwinds are expected to be offset by favorable FX on inventory flow through. As you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. Starting with base growth in Q4, we increased our organic growth and expect strong mid-single-digit growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions, above the 5.5% plus targeted growth profile we outlined at our Investor Day.  This includes absorbing the impact of a difficult prior year comparison in Q4 of fiscal year '21 where the delta variant's surge drove high acuity and demand for infusion sets and products used in the care of COVID. Additionally, we delivered initial shipments of our combination flu COVID assays and benefited from the normalization of lab utilization and research activity. We also have a tough comparison to $316 million of COVID-only testing revenue in Q4 of last year as we expect minimal additional revenues this year with the decline in testing.  Regarding margins, we expect sequential improvement in base gross margins and at a level near year-to-date gross margin of 53.8%. While the impact of increased inflation on our business is expected to continue, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives. Regarding base operating margins, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. Sequentially, the improvement is driven by gross margin as well as continued strong leverage in selling and G&A and slightly lower R&D expense. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest in R&D at about 6% of sales.  While it is premature to provide guidance for fiscal year '23, especially in a macro environment that remains uncertain, we recognize that offering a more proactive perspective during this time is helpful. To begin, while we expect macro challenges to persist, we are not assuming they worsen and would anticipate that as we move towards the back end of the year, there may be some modest relief from some of the current supply chain complexity. We will reassess the environment ahead of providing guidance in November.  So with that caveat, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, which, based on current spot rates, would be a headwind to consider for next year, we remain confident in the strong value-creating framework we outlined at our Investor Day and expect to deliver 5.5% plus base revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This framework continues to be supported by a strong growth profile and continued margin improvement.  We expect the COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings would be at a level significantly below FY '22 and more likely at a run rate similar to the implied Q4 FY '22 or approximately $100 million for the full year. We will have a positive contribution from the full year benefit of revenue and income from Parata that will partially offset the reduced COVID testing.  So importantly, despite the anticipated reduction in COVID-only testing, on an all-in basis, we would expect adjusted EPS to be right around double-digit growth, which implies very strong double-digit base adjusted EPS growth. Based on what we see, it appears current external thinking largely reflects this. We will share more details regarding FY '23 on our year-end earnings call in November.  In closing, we are very pleased with our strong performance to date and the consistency of execution against our strategy that is enabling these results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders. With that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments. Let me -- maybe why don't we first start just with a quick comment on the Alaris, which we'll do one upfront and then I can walk you through the 2023. Yes. And so I'll build on some of the comments that we made in the opening comments. So first, as we think of 2023, we certainly know there's still a lot of uncertainty that remains in the marketplace. We actually wanted to try and get some context because we know there's questions out there. One, obviously, we have significantly strong growth profile in '22, right? Our guide would apply on an organic basis about 8.25% growth when you strip out Parata.  So folks, we knew there was questions about how you're going to cycle over that growth? Can you still deliver at your 5.5% plus? In addition to that, we knew there was sort of the open question as it related to COVID testing? And how do you think of that dynamic? And what it may do in terms of your earnings profile? So I think with that as a backdrop, we wanted to just reaffirm. We're extremely confident in our 5.5% plus growth profile that we outlined. Actually, I think an interesting way to think of that is if you do kind of 2-year math, it would imply a growth rate of about 7% '22 to '23.  So any way you look at that, it's a really strong base growth profile. We do see the impact of COVID-only testing dropping significantly as we said. We're planning for roughly $25 million kind of this quarter based on what we said and kind of see that more as a more normalized run rate. Obviously, if there's upside to that, it provides that embedded hedge to our portfolio that we've always talked about. So that will be a headwind that gets contemplated. With that said, you see the power of our capital allocation strategy going to work. We're pleased to announce the closing of the Parata acquisition. So that will be an offsetting element against the COVID-only revenue. That is not part of the 5.5% plus. So you think that the 5.5% plus as pure organic. We always said we're not reliant on the onetime lift from tuck-in M&A. And when we do benefit as part of that strategy is the organic lift we get as we cycle and anniversary those acquisitions. And then from an earnings profile, we're committed to the double-digit base adjusted EPS earnings growth. I think importantly though, the most important thing that we share, despite that, kind of COVID-only headwind, we think we can get right about a double-digit adjusted EPS growth profile as well on an all-in basis given the strength of the business, and we'll continue to drive margin improvement into next year.  All of that, obviously, we always think and talk about guidance on an FX-neutral basis. So it doesn't contemplate the currency that we've been talking about. That will impact every company. We're not different in that regard. I can try and help give you a little bit of context, obviously, as we set the year. But one simple way to think about it is euro is the predominant currency that has changed and impacted BD certainly.  If you look at the change from '21 to '22 where currently we've talked about a $425 million headwind, the percentage change in the euro from '21 to '22 is exactly the same as the current average rate we're planning in '22 to the current spot rate at 1 02, which would imply basically a similar kind of year-over-year headwind on currency. I think you're going to do some sort of margin drop-through on that. For BD, the margin tends to drop through at a lower rate given mix of business and other dynamics. With that said, I do think it's important to think of underlying as the most important metric on an FX-neutral basis, right? We're still generating that local cash. We have a very efficient cash allocation model, and we'll be able to put that cash to work. So all in all, I think with where we are with '22, it's a great year. We're on track to finish out a very strong year. And I think you can see based on what we share, we feel confident having momentum going into 2023. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, just to confirm, the 5.5% plus does not include Parata. Our commitment that we outlined in Investor Day, again, you always run the business on an operational basis and think of operational commitments. So both a double-digit commitment on base revenues and then what we just shared here despite the COVID only grow over, given the drop in COVID-only revenue, we're confident in right about a double-digit growth profile on an all-in basis as well, which is a great signal on the strength of our total business and the continued momentum we have as it relates to margin improvement that we've committed to as well. If you remember, we committed to about 25% through the 2025 period. We shared that last quarter.  As it relates to FX, again, this is going to apply to any company. Actually, we've been absorbing currency this year, but those commitments we make are always on an FX-neutral basis. You will have to adjust for revenue, and there will be some translational drop-through on that, that would have to be contemplated as you think of the final growth rate. But we need to wait and see where FX lands.  But again, that's not different from anyone, and it doesn't impact your -- it's certainly not reflective of your underlying business. And it doesn't impact the underlying cash that you've earned locally. And we have a capital deployment model that we'll continue to put that to work to continue to drive our strategy as it relates to tuck-in M&A and other things. So we're feeling really good about that growth profile.  Regarding free cash flow, there's been a -- there's really 3 big dynamics. We remain extremely focused on cash. Remember, there's a few ways to look at us. One, we committed to a net leverage ratio of around 2.5x. We're right at 2.7x now. We've been executing on our M&A strategy. So you can see we're putting that at work. We paid down debt as well, consistent with what we shared as part of the embecta spin. So we continue to execute against our capital allocation strategy. In addition to that, on the strength of the business and a disciplined approach we've applied to the balance sheet and how we're navigating that, we did get 2 debt rating upgrades this past quarter. So that was great to see. There are some differences in cash flow. The biggest difference is really just the year-over-year nuances as it relates to COVID-only testing and losing the higher base on COVID-only testing. There was also we also funded the pension. You can see that in the Q.  And then the third thing that we talked about as well is the one trade-off we've made intentionally is investing in inventory. And there's about a $400 million investment we're making there that I would call outsized inventory levels, driven by 3 factors. One of the most critical ones, of course, is procuring strategic components, raw materials, et cetera, to enable the strong growth profile. As you can imagine, there's still long lead times. We have a very efficient supply chain. And a lot of our product is spending time not in the plants, but rather on the water, so to speak, getting to customers. So we've made that investment.  And you do have -- everyone will have inflation kind of flow-through inventory as well. So we're not different in that regard as well. That explains the free cash flow. We remain very focused on that. We're going to continue to look at inventory. But in the short term, I think it's a prudent trade-off and is an enabler to these strong results. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So first, as it relates to this year, the margin has played out exactly as planned. As a matter of fact, year-to-date, we're sitting at basically 80% of our full year goal, that 250 basis points where we actually increased our margin improvement more to account for, call it, an accounting dynamic and reclass of line related to employee benefits. But we remain well on track.  We did explain at this quarter as it relates to GP specifically, would be the low watermark as you think of timing dynamics, in particular, the outsized inflation that started at the beginning of the year, how that rolls through inventory. And then from the time we started the year, things have only gotten a lot more complex. Inflation increased and supply chain complexity increased, which also increased things such as transportation, et cetera.  So as we've come into the year, just to maybe give you a little bit of context on margin, there's probably been about 100 basis points of -- to our P&L as it relates to outsized inflation above what we contemplated coming into the year given the additional complexity. It's about a 50% increase from what we originally planned. Despite all that, we're still holding our margin commitment for the year, which is really strong.  As you think of the components this year, and I share that because it will play into next year as well, our volume leverage we talked about coming into the year was supposed to be about 100 basis points. Given the strong revenue growth profile, we've done stronger there. That's been part of navigating the outsized inflation on the other end that I just articulated.  And then really beyond that, it's been cost improvement programs that we've dug into and enhanced. We've also been delivering our portfolio actions. There's multiple components to that one. Given the strong growth profile, right, we've been able to be more aggressive with navigating portfolio mix and simplifying our portfolio. We have price management as part of that, that we're fully executing against, which is a very strong. And then the third component to navigate this year has really been, again, on the strong growth profile, the leverage we're experiencing in operating margin and selling and G&A.  So as you think of '23, it's going to be all those same levers. You don't navigate this complexity doing just one thing. We certainly -- with another strong growth profile, we'd expect leverage in terms of volume flowing through our plants. We'll continue to drive a strong CIP agenda. We'll start to get more benefit from the SKU rationalization program as part of Project RECODE we talked about. You'll start getting early benefit from some of the architecture simplification work we also talked about. And you'll certainly continue to get more leverage on the operating margin with the strong growth profile on sales and G&A. In addition to that, we've always talked about kind of the simplification principle beyond just supply chain. And we're looking to also drive simplification through all of our functions. So that will also help. So we continue to build an inventory of things that we're doing that give us confidence as we move into '23. And then, again, maybe just a reminder for everyone, our goal is to get to about 25% by 2025. It implies roughly 100 basis points per year after 2022.  And if you think of that, kind of normally, you would probably just do that on a ratable basis. I think you can anticipate 2023 under-indexing that 100 basis points given you're going to have the rollover of this outsized inflation. And then on the back end, towards '25, you'll get more of the full benefits from Project RECODE. And we also talked about the leverage you get from Alaris coming back.  So those things will give you a slight lift in, call it, '24, '25. And '23 will probably slightly under-indexed versus kind of that 100 basis points equally, but it will still improve year-over-year. Yes. I think as it relates to kind of sharing any specifics on a number, we wouldn't do that for sure. I think we laid out the framework that's pretty clear. We did say that we, of course, look and are aware of kind of external thinking and the time coming into this print, it seemed reasonable knowing that folks would not have contemplated the carryover on currency. Anyway, that's -- I don't think there's much more to add there. I would just go back to, again, the commitment on the 5.5% plus growth profile, double-digit adjusted EPS growth on the base and even having confidence of right around double-digit growth, adjusting for the drop-down of the COVID-only testing. Just one other frame for everyone because I know you're all navigating. Things have changed a lot from the start of the year to where we are. And when you think of that through the lens of BD, there's really been 2 key things that have changed, one kind of a macro factor, right? When we started our initial guide and talked about what the year would be like we were contemplating pretty significant outsized inflation.  As the year progressed, whether it be the conflict in Ukraine and Russia, the COVID China shutdown, the complexity only grew. Inflation grew, as I noted earlier on the call. And the supply chain complexity increased. So again, about a 50% increase on what we originally contemplated about a 100 basis point headwind.  Then when you think of what's happened from BD. Our initial guide, when you kind of restate everything for embecta, we were at 6%. We're sitting here at 9% at the midpoint, right? That's 300 basis points or about $0.5 billion. So with more complexity, we've actually strengthened our growth profile and overcome all of those headwinds. And then I know there's a lot of puts and takes quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, there was also on the revenue side. Outsized COVID testing, we benefited from. That took our number up $300 million. But when you look at the EPS drop-through, it was north of $0.60 from the beginning of the year, inclusive of absorbing FX headwinds. And when you look at that then and think of what we've done from a margin standpoint, we've delivered exactly what we can actually slightly above our commitment. So we absorbed $100 million -- 100 basis points of headwind on the cost side, delivered outside performance as we've headed through the year on top line and fully held our margin commitment both on the base and EPS.  So I know there's lots of puts and takes as you go through the quarter. Even tax as an example, when you restate our guide for the initial tax, it would have been 13% to 14% ex embecta. We're now 13.5% to 14%. So we know we had some onetime timing items in this quarter, but we're actually absorbing tax pressure as well in those numbers. So you'll have a Q4 true-up, of course, given the timing here. But we're not even benefiting there as you think of kind of updating.  So it's been a very strong year. We're really proud of what everyone has done, our 75,000 employees navigating the complexity during this time and feel good about the momentum we have going into next year."

But despite that, we still posted really, really robust growth in BDI and PI, in particular, both domestically and internationally. And then just to follow up on Tom's comment on China, we posted in BDI another quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to invest there in Surgery with the Tissuemed acquisition in PI with the recently approved Venovo venous stent in China, which is -- which we've done cases already, and it's gone tremendously well. And we just also recently got approval on the Covera covered stent graft. So anytime we put anything into China, we get a really robust return. And as we've noted before, it's doubled since Bard is acquired by BD, and we look forward to continued robust growth there."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay through May 12, 2022, on BD's Investor Relations website at bd.com or by phone at 866-342-8591 for domestic calls and list the Area Code +1-203-518-9713 for international calls. The replay bridges are now dedicated, so you no longer need a conference ID to hear the replay. For today's call. All parties have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the call over to BD.\nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com. Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide highlights of our performance and the continued execution of our BD2025 strategy. Chris will then provide a financial review and our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. The Q2 results, we'll be discussing today include the results of our former diabetes care business as a spin-off of embecta, that was completed on April 01, subsequent to quarter end. On April 14, an 8-K was filed to provide re-casted historical financial information reflecting the results of operations of our former diabetes care business as discontinued operations for the 2019, 2022 and 2021 fiscal years and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. On today's call, we'll give an updated outlook for fiscal '22 for both legacy BD, which includes our former diabetes care business and BD RemainCo. We anticipate recasted financial information for the second quarter of FY '22 will be available by the end of May. In the meantime, to assist you with FY '22 RemainCo models, we're providing estimated impacts of excluding our former diabetes care business from our Q2 results. We don\u2019t expect the Q2 recated financial information to differ material from the estimated impact nor affect the updated outlook for FY '22 that we're providing today. We also do not plan to comment on diabetes care after this quarter. In addition to our prepared remarks, you can find this information on our earnings presentation that is posted on our IR website. Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A session by our segment presidents, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of the Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in earnings presentation slides and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically note it as a calendar period. I would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines term you'll hear today, such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results excluding estimated COVID-only testing. With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 with revenues of $5 billion and base revenue growth of over 10%. These results reflect the continued focused execution of our BD 2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business. We exceeded our revenue, margin and earnings goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy, and year-to-date, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. In addition, we successfully executed the spin of our diabetes care business on April 1, which is now a standalone and publicly traded company named Embecta. It trades on NASDAQ under the ticker EMBC. I'm very pleased with how our strategy is progressing and coming to life. Through our efforts to grow, simplify and empower our company, we are creating an agile and resilient organization that is well positioned to deliver strong performance. Our durable core reflects our leadership position in areas of healthcare that remain in high demand. These are the products and solutions that form the backbone of healthcare around the world and create a very stable business, that weather storms and uncertainty. Through the performance of our durable core and our cash flow initiatives, we are fuelling our growth strategy with investments in organic innovation and tuck-in M&A. The investments we are making are targeted toward higher growth spaces aligned to the irreversible forces that are transforming the future of global healthcare across smart connected care, a shift to alternative care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. You are beginning to see the impacts of that shift in our growth. Through the simplified pillar of our BD 2025 strategy, we are reducing complexity and driving excellence across supply chain operations, which delivers efficiencies and enhances our margin profile while improving customer satisfaction. And we're doing this by improving asset utilization and labor productivity while also enhancing our supply chain resilience, responsiveness and sustainability, all of which are more critical than ever in today's environment. Our focused execution of our strategy is creating momentum and gives us confidence in our outlook, despite the challenging macro environment, which has evolved dramatically since our last earnings call. The conflict in Ukraine, increased supply chain challenges, energy price escalation, increased inflation and COVID-driven shutdowns in China are impacting nearly every company in the world. And while BD is not immune to these challenges, we believe the actions we've taken to drive our growth and simplification initiatives and empower our talented organization of over 75,000 associates, uniquely position us to lead in this environment and give me continued confidence in our ability to execute during these times. I'd like to take a few minutes to share some additional thoughts on the evolving macroeconomic environment. Starting with supply chain and inflation. Like most organizations across healthcare, BD has faced increased inflationary pressure and supply chain constraints. However, our simplification strategy is driving our ability to largely offset these pressures and enabling our associates to respond to these rising challenges. An example is every year as part of our enterprise risk management process, we invest to systematically validate alternative suppliers for our most critical products and this isn't something we started this year. We've been doing this for a decade and it's showing benefits in this environment. More recently, we were able to, we've invested in additional inventory to secure access to scarce raw materials and electronic components such as semiconductor chips, and we've directly contracted for alternative transportation methods to ensure the continuity of supply for our customers. In addition, we're investing in capacity expansion and regional sourcing to create an agile supply chain that will be more responsive to events around the world. A key piece of our Simplify strategy is our ReCoDe effort, which includes a focus on portfolio simplification, including SKU rationalization. Our strong growth profile has enabled us to accelerate the elimination of lower margin SKUs and optimize our mix, which enables plant efficiency and for us to produce more of the products that are most critical to our customers. All of these strategic actions have helped us to move with speed and efficiency to mitigate the challenges of this environment. And we believe we are unique in our response. Now regarding COVID, the global healthcare system continues to be more agile and better prepared, amid the emergence of new variants and spikes in COVID cases. And thus, while COVID 19 isn't behind us, healthcare utilization levels, deferrable procedure volumes and lab activities are consistently returning to pre-COVID levels in much of the world. However, the medical industry continues to be impacted when new variants develop and waves of COVID emerge. As you know, this is currently happening in China, as the government takes meaningful steps to prevent the spread of new variants. These efforts have had an unexpected impact on healthcare procedures, lab testing and the supply chain as reflected in our second quarter China results. And while this is continuing into the third quarter, we expect to mitigate most of the impact over the balance of the year assuming there isn't any additional extended waves that require more significant COVID prevention actions. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. Despite the above complexities, the need for critical healthcare products and services has never proven to be more important and our portfolio is well positioned to support clinicians and patients around the world. Moving on, I'll now provide more detail on the progress we're making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. As we shared in the November Investor Day, we've been focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. We significantly improved our on-time milestones and on-time launch metrics, which are both over 90% year-to-date. In addition to enhanced productivity, our increased investments in organic innovation are contributing to our performance. Some recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include BD Evolve, which is a fill at time of use, time delayed drug delivery system and was released for clinical trials in January. Multiple clinical trials are now underway by our pharmaceutical customers, and we see significant commercial interest with several signed development agreements. We also launched new-to-world BD reagent technology in April, which was developed with novel dye technology and AI guidance. The new BD Horizon RealYellow 586 flow psychometry reagents are the first in the series and they have the potential to accelerate discovery and drug development by enabling greater insights from biological samples. And we received 510-K clearance of our TREK bone biopsy device that was submitted to the FDA last quarter with launch expected later this fiscal year. This device allows for faster sampling and is available on a broad range of sizes to accommodate variety of procedural needs. Beyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. Consistent with our strategy to bring new transformative solutions to our portfolio that improved chronic disease outcomes, we released BD Libertas a pre-filled wearable injector that enables simple self-administration of larger volume doses for chronic disease. We've completed five clinical trials with our 5 ML product and are accelerating development of our 10 ML product with clinical release targeted in late FY '23, or early '24. The BD Core MX module and the CTGCTV2 Assay on BD Core are now under FDA review. Already CE marked outside of the US clearance in the US will give BD access to the high volume sexually transmitted infections testing market on a fully automated and integrated platform. This assay already cleared on BD Max as the only FDA cleared triplex assay for the three most prevalent non-viral STIs. The Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system is also currently under FDA review and is expected to launch this fiscal year. Already CE marked outside the US, the system is uniquely designed with a three-in-one method of action that removes fresh thrombus and to our thromboembolic material and peripheral vasculature. Also expanding our venous portfolio is the recent FDA approval of the Venovo venous stent. The relaunch of Venovo reflects strong execution by the team with shipments to customers already occurring this month. In addition to organic innovation, our strong cash flows are also enabling execution of our tuck-in M&A strategy. Fiscal year-to-date we've complete -- we've committed approximately $500 million through the completion of four acquisitions. In addition to three acquisitions in the prior quarter, in Q2, we closed Cytognos, whose differentiated flow cytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer brings an important addition to our Biosciences business and accelerates our strategy to support chronic disease management. We believe that the current environment coupled with our strong cash flow and robust M&A funnel positions us well to create value through our tuck-in M&A strategy while remaining disciplined. Beyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our discipline capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share purchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact toward improving outcomes for patients and providers and in that spirit, we also recently announced the inaugural members of our external Scientific Advisory Board. The SAB is comprised of top medical key opinion leaders, science and technology experts and experienced innovation leaders. The SAB is a new governance mechanism for BD, which will meet to review and advise on BD's technology capabilities, our innovation pipeline, tuck M&A opportunities and early stage investments. Finally, I'd like to comment on the strong progress we're making, advancing our ESG strategy and goals. One of the actions we announced this quarter that I'm particularly pleased with is the formation of our sustainable medical technology institute. This is another step forward as we advance our 2030 ESG commitments and BD's focus on ensuring our portfolio leads the way on reducing the environment impacts of medical products. We are proud to receive continued external recognitions for our ESG efforts, including recently being named Newsweek's inaugural list of America's most trusted companies and the Forbes 2022 list of best employers for diversity, as well as ranking number one in the healthcare equipment and services industry informs America's best large employers list. In summary, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making, advancing our BD 2025 strategy and our strong execution navigating a challenging environment, which is reflected in our strong Q2 performance. This performance gives us confidence in our updated guidance, which raises the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges. We remain well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth and create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks Tom. So echoing Tom's comments, our Q2 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, we remain committed to supporting our customers and their patients and have made investments in many areas, including inventory, transportation, portfolio, simplification, and innovation, so that we can continue to do our best to ensure continuity of delivering critical healthcare offerings. We are delivering strong performance while simultaneously managing the increasing macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. This balanced approach is helping us make strong progress against both our short and longer term commitments. Turning to our revenue performance, we delivered $5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 10.2% or 9.6% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Our revenue performance is supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions, we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. Price contributed 180 basis points to growth in Q2. While this is well below inflationary levels, it is one of many factors that is enabling our investments to ensure we can continue to deliver our healthcare all offerings to our customers. COVID only testing revenues were $214 million, which is expected to decline from $474 million last year. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times is reflected in the performance across our segments with medical growing 6.4%, life sciences base revenues growing 17.1% and interventional growing 11.2%. Total company base business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the US and Europe, along with mid-single digit growth in Latin America, which helped to offset lower the normal mid-single digit growth in China, which was impacted by restrictions implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID late in the quarter. Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the second quarter growing 6.4%. Strong performance across our pharmaceutical systems, medication management solutions and medication delivery solutions businesses was partially offset by an expected decline in diabetes care. Excluding diabetes care, BD medical revenues grew 7.5%. MDS revenues increased 5.3%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable core products. Performance in MDS reflects execution of our comprehensive vascular access management strategy, including early momentum of our one stick hospital stay, which is driving competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices, particularly in the US. Performance also reflects a tough comparison due to a decline in syringe utilization for vaccinations. MMS revenues grew 7.8%. In our dispensing business, high single digit revenue growth was driven by continued strong worldwide demand for connected medication management solutions in both acute and non-acute care settings. Within our infusion business, revenue growth reflects strong performance in infusion sets driven by increased pump placements outside the US during the course of the COVID pandemic. Farm systems' revenue grew 12.2% driven by continued strong demand for prefill devices supported by our differentiated and expanding supply capacity. Demand for these devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs. Growth was also aided by the expansion of services provided to small and mid-sized pharma customers through the recent acquisition of ZebraSci. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the second quarter. The decline of 4.2% year-over-year is solely due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.1%. IDS revenues declined 6.8%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 21.8%. Performance in our IDS base business includes sales of our new combination flu COVID assays for BD Veritor and BD MAX that were ahead of our expectations and also reflects the soft comparison to the prior year where the flu season was limited. Demand for our combination assays was driven by strong adoption of a broader respiratory panel in timing of dealer stocking. IDS-base revenues were also driven by strong demand for specimen management products and strong performance in our molecular diagnostics portfolio, driven by growth in both BD Core and BD MAX reagents with increased utilization across our larger install base. Biosciences revenues increased 5.6% driven by continued strong demand for research reagents as a result of lab utilization, having returned to more normal pre-COVID levels and increasing adoption of our e-commerce platform. Instrument production in the quarter was limited by supply challenges for electronic components and as a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog. We expect to fulfil those orders over the balance of the year. BD interventional revenues totalled $1.1 billion in the second quarter, growing 11.2%. This reflects strong performance across the segment with double-digit growth in the US and China. Our strong global performance is driving our ability to offset the impact of planned product line discontinuations, particularly in PI and UCC of lower margin and nonstrategic products as part of our portfolio simplification strategy. The segment's result also reflect the easier prior year comparison resulting from the Delta variant. Revenues in surgery grew 17.5%. Again, as a reminder, Q2 reflects a soft comparison to the prior year when revenues declined 7.7%. Excluding the soft comparison, revenues grew in the high single digits driven by hernia, biosurgery and infection prevention including the recent acquisitions of Tepha and Tissuemed. Revenues in peripheral intervention grew 8.5%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the US with strength across our peripheral vascular disease, end stage kidney disease and oncology platforms. We continue to expand our peripheral vascular innovations and are driving strong growth through share gains from our recent acquisition of Straub and Venclose. Urology and critical care revenues grew 8.8% driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in both acute and non-acute cares settings as we continue to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was continued back order recovery in acute urology and continued solid performance in targeted temperature management with our smart, connected care enabled Arctic Sun platform. Now moving to our P&L. In Q2, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations with adjusted net income of $937 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.18. We delivered base gross margin of 55.2% and base operating margin of 24% in Q2. Key drivers of gross margin include a benefit from our strategic portfolio initiatives, including mixed optimization and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. And while inflation was broadly in line with our expectations, we did realize an escalating impact during the quarter that was largely offset by our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory in 2021 that benefited our GP this quarter as a blow-through sales. We leveraged our base SSG&A as a percent of sales by over 200 basis points, driven by our focus on leveraging our base G&A expenses partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in customer shipping. R&D of 6.4% of sales reflects some accelerated phasing of investments and planned increases year over year, consistent with our strategy to support our long-term growth outlook. Our tax rating Q2 was higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of sales. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, cash flows from operations totaled approximately $1.1 billion year to date. Q2 cash flow from operations reflects a higher than normal inventory balance as we may strategic investments to increase stocking of raw materials, such as electronic components, as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. We ended Q2 with a strong cash balance of $3.1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8 times. Our cash balance includes the receipt of a cash distribution from embecta at the end of Q2. In accordance with the tax free nature of the spin and consistent with our capital allocation priorities, including our net leverage goals, we intend to utilize $1 billion of the embecta distribution over the coming quarters for debt pay-down. The remaining $400 million of the distribution provides additional flexibility and will likely be deployed early in fiscal '23 with a bias towards share purchases, subject to market conditions and other strategic considerations. With the spin of embecta now complete, we've achieved our targeted dividend payout ratio of about 30% as we've maintained our dividend. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows, provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A. As Francesca mentioned to assist you with your FY '22 models, we provided our best estimates of the impact of the spin on certain line items for Q2 in today's slide presentation. We estimate a $260 million impact to revenue, a 100 basis points to adjusted gross margin and 160 basis points to adjusted operating margin and $0.45 to adjusted EPS. Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions; first, some macro considerations that support our guidance; while we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes that continued easing of COVID 19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Regarding China specifically, we expect to mitigate the impact from the current lockdowns over the balance of the fiscal year as we are assuming the restrictions will ease in May with recovery ramping up through fiscal Q3. In addition, our guidance assumes that the core congestion does begin to ease and will not have a lasting impact on our China business and other markets. While there could be additional lockdowns in China and other markets, our guidance assumes countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients. Additionally, we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year and into next fiscal year, but we are not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds. While these pressures are meaningful, we believe we are on track with our margin recovery initiatives and will continue to proactively manage this. We expect to be able to largely offset these incremental inflationary impacts, given our strong performance in Q2, an increased focus in the back half of our fiscal year to execute our company-wide mitigation initiatives. As our first half results include diabetes care, we are providing guidance today on a legacy BD basis that includes diabetes care. So you have a like-for-like comparison versus our February guidance. Then we are also providing remain guidance for the full fiscal year, which excludes diabetes care in all four quarters, along with the spin impact for each guidance metric. This is also laid out on the FY '22 guidance summary slide in the guidance section in our RemainCo earnings presentation. As a reminder, going forward, our first half diabetes care results will be reflected as discontinued operations, and we will only be discussing RemainCo performance. Now moving to our updated guidance for are fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our three segments, given our performance and momentum in our base business and thus on a legacy BD basis, before adjusting for the diabetes care spin, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. We now expect legacy BD base news to grow 6.75% to 7.75% on an FX neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase of a 100 basis points from our previous guidance of 5.75% to 6.75% growth. On a RemainCo basis, we expect base revenues to grow 7.25% to 8.25% on an FX neutral basis. This is an acceleration of approximately 50 basis points over BD legacy growth as our diabetes care business was a negative contributor to growth rates. The spin impact also includes a small contribution of revenues BD will earn in connection with agreements with embecta. For COVID-only testing, we continue to assume approximately $450 million in revenue. As expected, testing demand has slowed and our full-year COVID-only revenue expectations are waited to the first half of the year. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points or about $400 million to total company revenues on both a BD Legacy and RemainCo basis on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of 75 basis points or $150 million compared to our prior guidance and is driven by of the strengthening of the US dollar. So all in, we are increasing our legacy BD total reported revenue guidance by $50 million to a range of $19.6 billion to $19.8 billion. On a RemainCo basis, we expect total revenues of $18.5 billion to $18.7 billion. On a Legacy BD basis, we still expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 200 basis points over 21.7% in fiscal '21. Despite a more challenging macro environment anticipated over the back half of the year, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the competence that we will be able to offset the incremental inflationary pressures. On a RemainCo basis, the embecta spin enhances our anticipated base margin expansion by approximately 50 basis points. And as a result, we expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 250 basis points in comparison to 19.6% in FY '21 as recasted. We also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models; on a RemainCo basis, we expect $60 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest other which reflects a minimal benefit from the use of embecta proceeds compared to our legacy BD expectation of $50 million to $75 million. On a Legacy BD basis, we now expect an effective tax rate of 13% to 14% for the full year compared to 12.5% to 13.5% previously due to geographic mix as reflected in our revised guidance. For RemainCo, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14.5%, which reflects the tax rate, excluding our diabetes care business. Our updated guidance still assume share purchases that at a minimum offset, any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume material change in shares outstanding. All in on a Legacy BD basis, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.85 and $13 compared to $12.80 to $13 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.025 at the midpoint. The core drivers of the increase include $0.125 [ph] driven by the momentum and strength in our base business with the series of strategic mitigation actions we discussed earlier expected the largely offset increased inflationary pressures and a $0.05 headwind from a higher effective tax rate. So operationally, this is an increase of $0.750. We expect an estimated incremental negative impact from currency of about $0.05 resulting in a $0.025 increase to our adjusted reported earnings guidance at the midpoint. On a RemainCo basis, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $11.15 to $11.30 cents. This reflects an adjustment from the embecta spin of about a $1.70. This accounts for a half year of TSA income of about $35 million that will be realized in the second half of the fiscal year and recorded in other operating income on an adjusted basis and it includes the contribution from supply agreements, with embecta and the benefit from financing, which are both expected to be minimal. As you think about the TSA income next year for your models, it would not be accurate to double the half year of TSA income as the services provided and income received will decline over time. As a reminder, BD shareholders received embecta shares upon completion of the spin. As you think of the commitments we made during our Investor Day on a BD RemainCo basis, our long-term targeted growth profile has been enhanced and increases our confidence in our ability to deliver our 5.5% plus base revenue growth target. Additionally, we are now targeting more than 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through fiscal year '25 against the re-casted fiscal year '21 margin. And notably, based on what we know today, all things being equal, we think BD RemainCo can deliver the absolute pre-pandemic operating margin level of legacy BD, which was about 25% by the end of that same time period. As we previously shared, this will lend itself nicely to double-digit EPS growth and a strong value proposition. As you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of your RemainCo base revenue and earnings. We continue to expect base revenue growth to be fairly rateable in the back half of the year. Regarding our margins and P&L, first on a year-over-year basis for Q3, we expect significant improvement in base operating margin compared the re-casted 17.7% in the prior year. Additionally, we expect the Q3 year-over-year improvement to be larger than what we delivered in Q2. Sequentially from Q2 to Q3, we expect a modest step down due to a stronger Q2, primarily driven by product mix most notably our flu COVID combo test and increased inflationary pressures in the second half. As a result, Q3 is now projected to be the low watermark for the year. In Q4, we expect the impact of increased inflation on our business to continue. However, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives flowing through. In addition, we continue to see our SSG&A and RD dollars relatively evenly spread over the remainder of the year, which will drive strong operating leverage on Q4's higher revenue dollars. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, our average tax rate for the balance of the year is about 14.5%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters. So in summary, we are advancing our BD 2025 strategic objectives. Our underlying business is strong as evidenced by our strong base revenue and earnings performance. We remain focused on execution and our confident in delivering against our performance goals, despite navigating a complex macro environment as evidenced by our updated guidance, which increases the midpoint of both our reported revenue and adjusted EPS. Further, we are well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable value with our long-term commitments enhancing with the completion of the spin. I'll now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now active.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats in a good print here and thanks for taking my question. My first one maybe on the updated guidance here. We did close to 9% organic for first half and I'm looking at the legacy BD [rate] (ph). The midpoint of 7.25%, which implies mid-single 5.5-ish for the back half. I just want to make sure this is a comp issue or is there any timing impact first half versus the second half? Any change in first half or second half organic cadence on an underlying basis?\nChristopher DelOrefice: I appreciate the question. It's Chris. Hope you're well. Your math is correct. So again, our first half growth extremely strong here at about 9% on a year-to-date basis. Obviously we had benefited from some one-time items, but we also overcome some headwinds in that period too. I think when we talked last quarter and we would frame this quarter as probably from call it underlying adjusting for some of those puts and takes around seven-ish percent growth, the back half, you're right, 5.5% growth. I think there's a couple things to contemplate there. Of course, China, there will be a pretty significant impact in Q3 as they recover. We expect that recovery -- the recovery started in May. We expect that to ramp through June and we expect to make the majority of that up in the back half. Additionally, we do have some comps as you think of the back half of the year in particular our life sciences business. We did have our Triplex launch there. So if you look at Q4 that was a peak performance period for that business. So there's a couple kind of comps along with the China situation that will cycle through Q3 into Q4 to consider there in the back half, but 5.5% growth is consistent with our long-term outlook of 5.5-plus on top of a front half of 9%. So all in a really strong year. I think the other thing I would point to, if you look at the quarter performance from a top line standpoint, we actually increased our organic guide more than the beep on the base business in Q2. So it actually implies stronger second half performance. So we actually did strengthen our second half outlook, despite some of those headwinds that I noted. So hopefully that helps.\nVijay Kumar: Yeah. That was helpful for us. And maybe one on the longer-term LRP guidance that you laid out at the Analyst Day. Appreciate all the details in the earning deck and making comparison easier. The longer term 5.5 on top $400 plus and margins in double-ish earnings. Are there any cadence issues when we think Chris for fiscal '23, and I'm not asking for a specific '23 guidance, I know it's early for that, but just thinking about any moving pieces here, I think FX, COVID diagnostic testing drop off, comes to my mind. So when you think about the base of $11.15 to $11.30 in fiscal '22, should we still expect that LRP to be intact for fiscal '23 over the base?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah, it's a great question. Obviously, to your point, there's a lot of moving parts and one, if you remember our Investor Day guide, we actually stripped out testing. We see testing as something that'll move more to kind of the endemic opportunity here that gets more embedded in the base. So we need to see how that plays out this year. Obviously I think an important caveat just to see how COVID dynamics, the macro-inflationary environment plays out as well. So I think some big considerations, but what I would point you to over the long term horizon, definitely over the long term horizon, obviously there's can be fluctuations year-to-year, but you're seeing it play out this year. One definitely the enhanced growth profile, the five-five plus we're well north of that this year, given our strong focus on innovation and R&D, the benefit we're getting from tuck in acquisitions. As a matter of fact, just as a reminder, you'll see that we did provide the one-time lift associated with the tuck-in acquisitions, which was roughly 60 basis points. That was never part of our five, five plus. What was part of our five, five plus was taking those acquisitions and growing them. These are profitable double-digit growth opportunities. They're actually enhancing our growth profile on a year-to-date basis by about 30 basis points above that 60 basis points. So true organic growth once we've cycled over the anniversary. So I think we're going to continue to focus on our growth strategy. We remain confident in the five, five plus the spin of diabetes certainly enhances that confidence. You did see a 50 basis point lift here, just in this year alone, as a result of that. As we've talked about, that was a drag on growth. As you think of operating margin, I shared a couple key things. One, this was a very important year for us is when we had committed the 400 basis points, we were going to deliver half of that in one year. So doing that in the face of the inflationary environment we're in with inflation, normal inflation being 2%, we're talking about 8%, 4X inflation happening is quite a testament to cost improvement. I don\u2019t know if you picked up in the talk track, but we did commit that we are going to do better than 400 basis points over that timeframe. Not only that, we think that by 2025, we can get back to the legacy operating margin of about 25%. And if you ask how we're going to do that, if you think of all the structural change we've made this year, it's a compensating for the inflation. We've actually done more cost improvement and enhancement through our simplification programs. That are actually creating more underlying value that we expect to carry over the long term. So definitely we feel really good about our long-term Investor Day outlook, of course, assuming this environment that we're in at some point kind of settles back to more normal here, hopefully as we exit this year into next year. There may be a little bit of typical choppiness from year-to-year within that. But we certainly expect to deliver continued strong growth in each year and strong margin improvement this year.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Chris. And thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTravis Steed: Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. Chris, I'd just love to get a little bit more color on some of the operating margin bridge. I see you have 19.6% as the base for FY '21, 250 basis points on top of that gets you to kind of the low 22% range. When I'm thinking about '23, it sounds like you're comfortable somewhere around 50 basis points to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion in '23. Just love to see if that's how we should be thinking about it, which gets me to like a low $12 range for earning next year. If you have any early comments to that.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah, no, thanks. I appreciate the question. Look, again, I think as it relates to '23 it's a little premature to give specifics at this stage. I think certainly though with, call it my 200 basis points delivered this year, 250 basis points, if you adjust for Embecta. And with -- to get to what I said by the end of 2025, to get back to the 25% operating margin legacy, you're going to expect kind of a relatively ratable call it glide path to get there. The only thing I would point out is I do think '23 will be a transition period, because you're still going to have the structural impact of inflation that's been ongoing, that'll carry over into '23. So I do view that a little bit as a transition year and you'll get more lift as the environment normalizes over that time is how I would probably think of a ramp curve if that makes sense.\nTravis Steed: Yeah, it does. Thank you for that. I appreciate the extra color. And then when we look at some of the incremental inflation impacts that that you're offsetting pretty much essentially all the way offsetting, love to get a little bit more color on some of the pressures that you've seen and also when you think about pricing, it was 1.1% last quarter, 1.8% this quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it going forward, kind of the high 1% to 2% range, into '23 as well?\nTom Polen: Hey Travis, this is Tom and good morning, I'll start in and turn it over to Chris. I think in terms of what we're seeing on the inflation side, we saw earlier on quite sometime early last year, we recognized obviously the impacts of inflation as well as supply chain challenges. And we made a very clear statement that while there is going to be no company that would -- was going to avoid inflation and supply chain challenges, that we were very committed to looking to be the best in our industry at navigating those. And that's been the mindset that our entire team has approached this environment over the last two years. And I think you can see the commitment and actions of our team coming through in our performance from as well. And so I've got our team empowered and focused on executing our strategy. And as part of that, they're navigating this complex environment and we're pulling a number of levers to overcome what are shipping chips, resin, just general raw material and inflation points that we see and those levers that the teams are pulling range from continuous improvement being notably increased in our plants in this environment. We're taking additional cost containment actions across all areas of the business. We're driving an acceleration of our portfolio optimization and product mix. That's always been part of our recode simplification initiative. We saw this as an opportunity, particularly with the strong revenue growth that we're seeing to accelerate, exiting lower margin products and products that are adding complexity in our plants, that when we move those out, we can actually run our plants more efficiently and get out more of the products that our customers need most, which is really important in this environment. And then lastly, we looked at as a last resort. We are taking pricing actions as well and as you can see, we're able to to get those, which are just a portion of the overall inflationary costs that people are seeing in this environment. So all of that's being done to ensure that we're positioned to best serve our customers and our patients and really proud of the team's work there, Chris, any additional comments?\nChristopher DelOrefice: I think the only build is just to reinforce I think the strong underlying growth profile is really creating opportunities to drive some of that simplification. For example, the strategic skew rationalization efforts, right? We're absorbing that within our growth rate. It unlocks value in the form of margin, drives enhanced mix, new product innovation launches is a way that will more look to create value in the marketplace and get value back for that versus thinking of things just as price. It's really a bigger picture though. The price is actually extremely modest relative to the level of inflation but thanks.\nTravis Steed: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. Sorry to kind of follow up here, but maybe if I, I focus in on the second half implied guide here, it looks like there's something like $0.30 benefit from FX. And I was wondering if we're going to start to see, it sounds like, you're adding more into inventories. I would imagine it's at a slightly higher cost than previously. If we're going to start to see the impact of that flow through in fiscal second half, or if that's more a '23 impact. I'm just really trying to get to sort of the normalized earnings power going forward. Thanks.\nTom Polen: I would just say, maybe I'll make a comment, Robbie, this is Tom good morning. On the inventory situation, that's a very strategic investment that we're making to increase inventory on what I would describe a scarce raw materials. So think about raw materials like semiconductors and chips or other components that are difficult to get. You can see companies across the industry running into challenges on those. We have a very systematic approach to secure those assets and we'll take the higher impact in our inventory to be able to best serve our customers. And that's a commitment that we make. I don't think that -- we'll end up taking that down as situations stabilize over time. So we don't see that as a long term, we've been very, very focused on our cash flow as, you know, moving that from 75% free cash flow conversion to 90% as an ongoing 90% plus as an ongoing target. We're not changing that at all. And we continue to have a very strong focus on inventory. We just see this as a transient and strategic investment that's paying off for us and it's paying off for our customers.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thanks Robbie, for the question, let me let me, let me just anchor on kind of the full year and then I'll provide you some set. I can second half context, and of course as always we can engage further in the discussion. But in terms of the guide adjustment, the best way to think of it is sort of the a 100 basis points of organic growth. We actually increased our top line by about $180 million at the midpoint. If you look at the EPS walk that we had provided, we're dropping about just under $0.13 through, which is basically at a BD margin drop through with that raise. So nothing's changed. We've actually reconfirmed our margin profile as a result, we've taken the guide up for the, the stronger growth profile above actually what was delivered in Q2. So from a full year standpoint everything remains intact. There there's no currency really just drops through it at a margin rate. The margin obviously fluctuates based on currency mix dynamics and/or margin mix in those respective markets. I don't think there's anything unexpected there. As a matter of fact, the currency that we talked about that was a carryover benefit into the year has played out as expected. So I don't think there's anything there to contemplate and then I think as you think of second half margins what you can expect to see there will be a small sequential decline on Op margin from Q2 to Q3 is really primarily driven by the fact that last year Q2 to Q3, you had nearly a 250 basis point decline from Q2 to Q3, and it was our low watermark, and we're actually going to be increasing the improvement in operating margin in the quarter year-over-year, versus what we did this quarter. We did 180 basis points this quarter. We will have a step increase there. So you'll see it relatively stable, but a small dropdown accounting for that low point base that we're jumping off of from last year. And then we'll continue to increase from there is sort of the glide as you think of the second half. But again, so if I tie this into your question about going forward, I think the important way to think about this is on track for the 200 basis point of margin improvement for the full year 250 basis points adjusted when you do the pro forma for embecta, which was half of what we said as part of our full year Investor Day commitment. Quite a big progression in one year, especially in phase of the inflationary pressures, which should set us up nicely over the long term.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe just sneak in two very quick questions here, one what was the size of the combo flu COVID 19 testing revenues in quarter, and should we assume going forward that there's no revenue from the cannula agreement with embecta, or was this more just a timing issue? Thanks.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah, I can, I can take the second one maybe holistically. There will be, as, as noted in some of the public documents there will be various third party agree between Veta and BD. There will be a small contribution to top line, which would contemplate more supply agreements. We highlighted that as part of the 50 basis points lift. There was a small contribution. There there'll be a full year benefit next year. Obviously, but again, it was, it was not substantive. We had the TSA we said it was worth $35 million this year. It won't quite double next year because what's typical in the spin. Really the spirit of the TSA is to support and beta standing up as a standalone public company. And it gives us an opportunity to support them. We leverage our, our stranded costs to do that. So basically it keeps us whole from a supporting BECTA stranded cost standpoint. And then we, we shed those down as the TSA goes down in parallel. So there's no impact on a net basis from an income. So you should expect the 35 to lift next year, but not quite double,\nTom Polen: Maybe just we could turn it over to Dave's answer, not just the, the COVID combo test question, but maybe just give some overall color and what was a, a strong momentum in life sciences across both IDs and, and significant demand we're seeing in BDB as well. So, Dave?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thank, thank you Tom. Robbie, thanks for the question. I mean, just pulling back a little bit, I mean, just want to recognize the life science segment colleagues around the world for just a tremendous quarter. And that's two successive quarters now, 17% growth excluding testing. If I talk about the test, just the overall testing dynamics at that highest level, so, you remember that we have the COVID testing piece, which is like the single antigen and molecular tests. And you hear Chris talk about, that was 214 million for us in the quarter 400 million year to date. I think you'll recall that we'd also said that, we were biasing our sort of all COVID performance to the, to the first half of the year because we are seeing Moderate some moderation in testing. We expect that moderation to continue through the balance of the year. So that overall testing dynamics are playing out with what we said. I mean, we're very close to 90% of the full year testing expectation for the combo. This is obviously the flu and COVID assay both on our max and our veal platforms. We've not given that number specifically because that's, that's in a mix of a lot of puts and takes in the overall base business. There was growth there as, as Chris had said, if you think about that as a, as a compared to the prior to the same period prior year, that's where we saw some of the growth come from. We do expect from a strategy perspective going forward, we do see value in the overall COVID combo portfolio. As we think Colby will move to more of an endemic situation. It's just too early to call out as to what that number would be for the, for the full year, even getting into early Q1 '23 when nobody knows what the dynamics of the flu are going to be right now. Yeah.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks David and Robbie, maybe just a couple other small things to just give you a little color in terms of what would've comprised the, the revenue there, obviously there was almost no flu season last year, so you kind of got back to flu season. Additionally obviously the combo has a slightly higher value proposition. You benefited from that. Additionally there was a little bit of stocking giving. It was, it was new and you did have a lot of testing demand in that period where it was hard to get access to tests. So those were sort of the factors that, that played into where we were. But again, adjusting for that really strong underlying, especially in the back of still having back water in, in certain areas, both in life sciences and total.\nTom Polen: And Robbie, this is Tom, as, as Dave said, I think we've said from the moment we launched the test that the combo test will be the go to kind of replacement for the base flu test. And so we, we do think flu testing, which was as, as Chris mentioned, was base was completely absent last year that this year we did see flu back as something that was causing infections, we expect that that would continue going forward. Of course, the rate at which that, and the size of that market every year varies each year. But we do believe that that combo test now back in our, our revenue will continue to be persistent as the go-to product for flu test.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. And Rob, we just one just on strategy piece, just one more piece, there would be, we're very committed to just looking at what, what are the unmet needs for, our patients around the world on a go forward basis. So we, we are committed to, developing more combo tests and we talk to the analyst day around the potential for an at home combo test, using the, the platform that we acquired in, in December. So the innovation piece of the strategy still continues and, and obviously as timelines firm up on that, we'll commune as it gets better though.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on nice quarter here. Tom, on Alaris any update on the timing is it is fiscal 2023, reasonable assumption for, for when that's back in the us and at the investor last year, you talked about a new pump launching outside the us in fiscal 2022, I believe. Sorry if I'm wrong on the date. I can't remember if it was '22 or three, but any update on that? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Thank you, Larry, for the question. We've mentioned on several occasions that getting Alaris back on the mark, it is our number one priority. And while we're not providing any updates on, on timing, as, as we had had shared before, we are confident in the resources that we're investing in our submission and the team and the leadership that's tasked to make that happen. And so, we, we still think it's not prudent to predict the timeline given just how inherently complex these submissions are. And particularly that, that certainly applies to our filing. So as we had said, we don't expect clearance in '22, therefore any of our guidance doesn't factor that in, into our numbers for 20 gone what's in medical necessity and we'll continue to provide an update as, as that progresses, but we continue to remain focused on making sure that the FDA has the proper information for us to get clearance on that. And that will remain our focus in terms of the new pump for Europe. No, we remain very excited on that product and it is launching later this, later this year. So absolutely, Yeah.\nLawrence Biegelsen: And then thank you. Thank you for that just quickly, the supply constraint in Biosciences. Can you quantify that and, were there other supply constraints that hurt you this quarter? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Larry, let me make a, maybe a comment overall on supply constraints and then ask Dave to comment on, on Biosciences. We certainly saw record backlogs across the company. So demand was even much higher than what you saw as post in our revenue. And that's across every one of the segments. We saw demand in a number of categories, outstrip our ability to supply, even though we were producing at record levels. And, that's part of what gives us confidence as we look ahead you, we are working each and every day to, to get more out of our plants. We certainly see shortages in longer transit times for raw materials. We see shortages from certain suppliers. We work very aggressively with suppliers to help them secure raw materials. We even go so far as to put our own folks to help run supplier factories in certain cases, but we take, we take that part, those partnerships very seriously to optimize getting product to our customers, but we did end with a, a record backlog across each of the segments. And specifically to Biosciences turn to Dave. Yeah.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Larry, thanks for the question. So we, we've got, I mean, when you look at the backlog overall, we, we've not quantified it in terms of, the absolute number of instruments. This is, this is an instrument topic for us. It primarily sort of relates to the clinical side of the business. But as Chris had said in his in remarks, we anticipate with the supply with some of the supply securements that we've done the procurement leverage that we've been able to get. We expect this to clear up over the course of the year. So it just becomes a timing topic for us in the year. And the team is very confident about that. What we are doing to sort of mitigate any short term is we're obviously working on an allocation strategy. the research instrument base is, is still very strong. So we're prioritizing what we have to get everything out. And then we're just driving hard and aggressive on procurements Of those chips and those electronic components. We have a lot of the instruments sort of ready, built, ready to go. So as those things come in, we'll just execute and chip in the back half of the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel your line is now open.\nRick Wise: Hi Tom. Hi, Chris. Let's start off perhaps with BD interventional, we haven't had a chance to dive into that strong quarter. Clearly comps helped a couple things. Maybe you could comment on and, and more expansively. I was a little surprised by that China double digits help us understand, what's happening there and how sustainable that performance is. And curious in general, are you all seeing the electric procedure volume recovery continue into April and maybe last on interventional help us think about the key drivers beyond recovery, beyond comps as we look at not just the next quarter, but the next sort of year ahead. Is, is it product, is it execution? Is it pipeline, help us think through the, the drivers there? Thank you.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Go ahead, Simon.\nSimon Campion: Good morning, Rick. Listen, fir firstly again, just reflection on the quarter really solid quarter across all, all three of our business units and, and, the soft compare in, in some areas certainly helped helped us, but I'm still, very proud of the team for executing across are broad and complex and clinically relevant portfolio. And then you might recall from, from analyst day all the plans that we had and please to say that all, all those, you know programs that we that we shared with the broad community at analyst day, that they, they are all on track now specifically about perform in, in the quarter in China, in particular the peripheral inter intervention business is extremely strong in China. And you, you you'll have heard us say in the past that BDI in China has doubled in, in revenue since since bar was acquired by BDI. And that has been led by, by peripheral intervention and the oncology business in particular. We, we had some background challenges with Encore probes over the past several months, and that's, that's begun to alleviate, we had a, a backlog in, in sterilization and that's begun to alleviate and that has certainly helped drive our business forward. But even in, in ESKD and [indiscernible] in China they, they performed a extra ordinary well in the last quarter as they do as they do very, very frequently and that performance NPI was also reflected in surgery. And, and to a lesser extent in, in UCC as well now, moving forward our, our outlook for the future, as, as we're, we're focused on, on innovation and trying to out execute the competition. And, I've heard Tom mention in his, in his prepared remarks about the relaunch of the, of Ben Novo. So we've just brought that back into the market in the last in the last two weeks. And, and that's supported by the three year vernacular data which, which I think is unparalleled data in the in the Venus space. We're super pleased with the response from our sales team and our customers to the relaunch of that product. And that will certainly be a driver this year and next year, particularly when we couple that with the with the expected clearance anticipated clearance of the thrombectomy catheter which we hope to receive this quarter or, or next quarter. And that will put us in a very, very strong position in the venous space the track biopsy device, the Tom refer to as well, that's, that's due for launch imminently. And then in our UCC business the puric platform continues to, to, I would say, exceed our expectations and in late Q3, early Q4 we do expect to launch the mail version of puric, which we hold will be a, a driver of growth. And then finally a comment on our, our acquisitions NAFA acquisition has really performed very, very well. The tissue made acquisition, which was a acquisition for the China biosurgery market that we hope to bring to other geographies, but the Chinese team again, has executed on that. And then and then van close as well has performed very, very well in in the PI space. And just referring back to TIFA and, and the plans that we shared with you about our, our, our anticipated expansion to the breast space over the next several, several years now, we do expect to begin enrolling patients in a pilot study here in Q4 in one of the categories that we're investigating for breast. So a lot of, a lot of momentum behind the PDI team across all businesses and in the usual ways innovation in organic M&A and executing the field.\nRick Wise: Great. if I could follow up Tom you highlight, and I love your language, you're investing in three irreversible forces. That sounds great. So my question is just reflecting on Chris's commentary about your cash position and your priorities. I was a little surprised that you're going to deploy the 2 billion more towards share repo as opposed to M&A clearly it's going so well. So just wondering if you could put all that in perspective, help us think about your priorities and maybe on the M&A side. Okay. Is it AI informatics, robotics, new care? What's top of mind for you. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Sure. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Rick, and, and I'll, I'll start off and then I'll turn it to Chris. So, as we had described that at, at analyst day, we've really rethought how we view our portfolio and our approach to growth. And we, are looking at how we invest in our, in our large essential to healthcare durable core portfolio and fast growing transformative solutions. And those three areas that you mentioned, smart, connected care, new care settings, chronic disease outcomes. And we're, we're really pleased with the performance of both. Hopefully there's something I said in the in my prepared remarks that, that I think is an important takeaway for everyone, which is our for we've had a focus over the last several years of increasing BDS R&D execution capabilities. And you may have heard me say that we reached a peak performance past actually year to date where over 90% on time milestone deliveries and on time launches, that's absolutely top quartile in the industry and something that we're really proud of, the momentum that we've had there. If you look at the pipeline that we shared at analyst day as well, all very much on track, and you're seeing a us announce those executions. And as we look at milestones for those things also very much on track, which is giving us a lot of confidence as we look out over the LRP and the years ahead to your point, we've been, we're really pleased with how we're executing that tuck and M&A strategy, right? We've got very strong core growth. We're staying very disciplined to making sure that we're creating value for our shareholders through the, in the acquisitions that we're doing. We don't have to go out and buy growth. We've got strong growth in our core, and we're adding value on top of that with 80% of those tuck and M&A focused in those high growth transformative solutionaries. And you heard Chris describe that. So we're gonna continue there. We have a very strong, robust pipeline. We think that actually this men, if anything, is creating incremental opportunities for us as we look ahead, and so we're gonna stay active and disciplined in there, but we do see the opportunity for that to continue to shift BDS growth rate upward. As we look ahead over the next coming years in terms of our decision and how we're using the cash from the, the spin. Let me turn it over to Chris on that.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Yeah. Rick, thanks for the question. So first of all, the, the tax free nature of the spin requires you to think about allocating between either debt and or share purchase. What we actually outlined in the script was we're going to prioritize a billion dollars of debt. Paydown, that's very consistent actually with our capital allocation strategy, maintaining a strong net leverage ratio, which gives us a lot of financial flex to actually support the strategy that, that Tom just outlined the, the balance of about 400 million plus will be opportunistic about. We do have a bias for that smaller remaining portion towards Sherry purchase, but of course will be dependent on market conditions and, and other strategic considerations. And then just to double down a little bit on, so that that's discreet and separate decision that, that we're taking associated with the spin beyond that our capital allocation strategy remains exactly intact as, as Tom articulated the most important thing. Actually that I think he shared is we're doing all this from a position of strength, underlying strength. It allows us to be extremely disciplined and identify S that have strong margin profile, strong growth profiles strategically fit against those three irreversible forces drive transformative solutions. So we will look to continue to drive strong cash flow with, by the way, higher R&D investments. We of course have continued to prioritize our, our dividend which actually the payout ratio know increased post spin another value to BD shareholders. And then we expected about one and a half to 2 billion of excess cash after doing all of those things where tuck in M&A would continue to absolutely be our, our priority. But importantly, we did agree that we would make sure at minimum we would do repurchases that avoid any dilution from share base comp. So that's the capital allocation strategy that we're, we're executing now. Thanks.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Tom Polen for any additional or closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay. Thank you operator. And thank you today for, for joining our call and for all of the questions. I hope everyone took away a couple key points from our discussion today. BD is very well positioned to continue to deliver value in uncertain times. And we're seeing that driven by the execution of our BD 2025 strategy, which has led by our innovation driven growth strategy. This is we had strong base business performance across all three segments. We're continuing execution, delivering enhanced margin profile, amidst macroeconomic pressures. We've now successfully completed the spinoff of our diabetes care business as part of our simplification strategy. And today we further increased revenue and EPS guidance on strong results. Despite continued market uncertainty. As we wrap up today's call, I want to just take a moment to thank the 75,000 members of the BD team and those listening today who are working around the clock to ensure production and availability of essential products for patients and providers and who are going above and beyond to support our customers. I want to thank our teams who are working to bring new innovations to market that improve outcomes for patients and providers, and that are reshaping the future of healthcare through both our durable core and transformative solutions. And I want to thank our teams who are working to make BD stronger by simplifying our network, our portfolio, and our processes, as I've said many times while every company is navigating macro challenges, we're focused on being the best in our industry at doing so and to approach every challenge and every opportunity with a growth mindset. And we're doing exactly that. So thank all of you for attending today and be well,\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's audio webcast. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 with revenues of $5 billion and base revenue growth of over 10%. These results reflect the continued focused execution of our BD 2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business. We exceeded our revenue, margin and earnings goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy, and year-to-date, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. In addition, we successfully executed the spin of our diabetes care business on April 1, which is now a standalone and publicly traded company named Embecta. It trades on NASDAQ under the ticker EMBC. I'm very pleased with how our strategy is progressing and coming to life. Through our efforts to grow, simplify and empower our company, we are creating an agile and resilient organization that is well positioned to deliver strong performance. Our durable core reflects our leadership position in areas of healthcare that remain in high demand. These are the products and solutions that form the backbone of healthcare around the world and create a very stable business, that weather storms and uncertainty. Through the performance of our durable core and our cash flow initiatives, we are fuelling our growth strategy with investments in organic innovation and tuck-in M&A. The investments we are making are targeted toward higher growth spaces aligned to the irreversible forces that are transforming the future of global healthcare across smart connected care, a shift to alternative care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. You are beginning to see the impacts of that shift in our growth. Through the simplified pillar of our BD 2025 strategy, we are reducing complexity and driving excellence across supply chain operations, which delivers efficiencies and enhances our margin profile while improving customer satisfaction. And we're doing this by improving asset utilization and labor productivity while also enhancing our supply chain resilience, responsiveness and sustainability, all of which are more critical than ever in today's environment. Our focused execution of our strategy is creating momentum and gives us confidence in our outlook, despite the challenging macro environment, which has evolved dramatically since our last earnings call. The conflict in Ukraine, increased supply chain challenges, energy price escalation, increased inflation and COVID-driven shutdowns in China are impacting nearly every company in the world. And while BD is not immune to these challenges, we believe the actions we've taken to drive our growth and simplification initiatives and empower our talented organization of over 75,000 associates, uniquely position us to lead in this environment and give me continued confidence in our ability to execute during these times. I'd like to take a few minutes to share some additional thoughts on the evolving macroeconomic environment. Starting with supply chain and inflation. Like most organizations across healthcare, BD has faced increased inflationary pressure and supply chain constraints. However, our simplification strategy is driving our ability to largely offset these pressures and enabling our associates to respond to these rising challenges. An example is every year as part of our enterprise risk management process, we invest to systematically validate alternative suppliers for our most critical products and this isn't something we started this year. We've been doing this for a decade and it's showing benefits in this environment. More recently, we were able to, we've invested in additional inventory to secure access to scarce raw materials and electronic components such as semiconductor chips, and we've directly contracted for alternative transportation methods to ensure the continuity of supply for our customers. In addition, we're investing in capacity expansion and regional sourcing to create an agile supply chain that will be more responsive to events around the world. A key piece of our Simplify strategy is our ReCoDe effort, which includes a focus on portfolio simplification, including SKU rationalization. Our strong growth profile has enabled us to accelerate the elimination of lower margin SKUs and optimize our mix, which enables plant efficiency and for us to produce more of the products that are most critical to our customers. All of these strategic actions have helped us to move with speed and efficiency to mitigate the challenges of this environment. And we believe we are unique in our response. Now regarding COVID, the global healthcare system continues to be more agile and better prepared, amid the emergence of new variants and spikes in COVID cases. And thus, while COVID 19 isn't behind us, healthcare utilization levels, deferrable procedure volumes and lab activities are consistently returning to pre-COVID levels in much of the world. However, the medical industry continues to be impacted when new variants develop and waves of COVID emerge. As you know, this is currently happening in China, as the government takes meaningful steps to prevent the spread of new variants. These efforts have had an unexpected impact on healthcare procedures, lab testing and the supply chain as reflected in our second quarter China results. And while this is continuing into the third quarter, we expect to mitigate most of the impact over the balance of the year assuming there isn't any additional extended waves that require more significant COVID prevention actions. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. Despite the above complexities, the need for critical healthcare products and services has never proven to be more important and our portfolio is well positioned to support clinicians and patients around the world. Moving on, I'll now provide more detail on the progress we're making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. As we shared in the November Investor Day, we've been focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. We significantly improved our on-time milestones and on-time launch metrics, which are both over 90% year-to-date. In addition to enhanced productivity, our increased investments in organic innovation are contributing to our performance. Some recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include BD Evolve, which is a fill at time of use, time delayed drug delivery system and was released for clinical trials in January. Multiple clinical trials are now underway by our pharmaceutical customers, and we see significant commercial interest with several signed development agreements. We also launched new-to-world BD reagent technology in April, which was developed with novel dye technology and AI guidance. The new BD Horizon RealYellow 586 flow psychometry reagents are the first in the series and they have the potential to accelerate discovery and drug development by enabling greater insights from biological samples. And we received 510-K clearance of our TREK bone biopsy device that was submitted to the FDA last quarter with launch expected later this fiscal year. This device allows for faster sampling and is available on a broad range of sizes to accommodate variety of procedural needs. Beyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. Consistent with our strategy to bring new transformative solutions to our portfolio that improved chronic disease outcomes, we released BD Libertas a pre-filled wearable injector that enables simple self-administration of larger volume doses for chronic disease. We've completed five clinical trials with our 5 ML product and are accelerating development of our 10 ML product with clinical release targeted in late FY '23, or early '24. The BD Core MX module and the CTGCTV2 Assay on BD Core are now under FDA review. Already CE marked outside of the US clearance in the US will give BD access to the high volume sexually transmitted infections testing market on a fully automated and integrated platform. This assay already cleared on BD Max as the only FDA cleared triplex assay for the three most prevalent non-viral STIs. The Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system is also currently under FDA review and is expected to launch this fiscal year. Already CE marked outside the US, the system is uniquely designed with a three-in-one method of action that removes fresh thrombus and to our thromboembolic material and peripheral vasculature. Also expanding our venous portfolio is the recent FDA approval of the Venovo venous stent. The relaunch of Venovo reflects strong execution by the team with shipments to customers already occurring this month. In addition to organic innovation, our strong cash flows are also enabling execution of our tuck-in M&A strategy. Fiscal year-to-date we've complete -- we've committed approximately $500 million through the completion of four acquisitions. In addition to three acquisitions in the prior quarter, in Q2, we closed Cytognos, whose differentiated flow cytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer brings an important addition to our Biosciences business and accelerates our strategy to support chronic disease management. We believe that the current environment coupled with our strong cash flow and robust M&A funnel positions us well to create value through our tuck-in M&A strategy while remaining disciplined. Beyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our discipline capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share purchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact toward improving outcomes for patients and providers and in that spirit, we also recently announced the inaugural members of our external Scientific Advisory Board. The SAB is comprised of top medical key opinion leaders, science and technology experts and experienced innovation leaders. The SAB is a new governance mechanism for BD, which will meet to review and advise on BD's technology capabilities, our innovation pipeline, tuck M&A opportunities and early stage investments. Finally, I'd like to comment on the strong progress we're making, advancing our ESG strategy and goals. One of the actions we announced this quarter that I'm particularly pleased with is the formation of our sustainable medical technology institute. This is another step forward as we advance our 2030 ESG commitments and BD's focus on ensuring our portfolio leads the way on reducing the environment impacts of medical products. We are proud to receive continued external recognitions for our ESG efforts, including recently being named Newsweek's inaugural list of America's most trusted companies and the Forbes 2022 list of best employers for diversity, as well as ranking number one in the healthcare equipment and services industry informs America's best large employers list. In summary, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making, advancing our BD 2025 strategy and our strong execution navigating a challenging environment, which is reflected in our strong Q2 performance. This performance gives us confidence in our updated guidance, which raises the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges. We remain well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth and create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. Hey Travis, this is Tom and good morning, I'll start in and turn it over to Chris. I think in terms of what we're seeing on the inflation side, we saw earlier on quite sometime early last year, we recognized obviously the impacts of inflation as well as supply chain challenges. And we made a very clear statement that while there is going to be no company that would -- was going to avoid inflation and supply chain challenges, that we were very committed to looking to be the best in our industry at navigating those. And that's been the mindset that our entire team has approached this environment over the last two years. And I think you can see the commitment and actions of our team coming through in our performance from as well. And so I've got our team empowered and focused on executing our strategy. And as part of that, they're navigating this complex environment and we're pulling a number of levers to overcome what are shipping chips, resin, just general raw material and inflation points that we see and those levers that the teams are pulling range from continuous improvement being notably increased in our plants in this environment. We're taking additional cost containment actions across all areas of the business. We're driving an acceleration of our portfolio optimization and product mix. That's always been part of our recode simplification initiative. We saw this as an opportunity, particularly with the strong revenue growth that we're seeing to accelerate, exiting lower margin products and products that are adding complexity in our plants, that when we move those out, we can actually run our plants more efficiently and get out more of the products that our customers need most, which is really important in this environment. And then lastly, we looked at as a last resort. We are taking pricing actions as well and as you can see, we're able to to get those, which are just a portion of the overall inflationary costs that people are seeing in this environment. So all of that's being done to ensure that we're positioned to best serve our customers and our patients and really proud of the team's work there, Chris, any additional comments? I would just say, maybe I'll make a comment, Robbie, this is Tom good morning. On the inventory situation, that's a very strategic investment that we're making to increase inventory on what I would describe a scarce raw materials. So think about raw materials like semiconductors and chips or other components that are difficult to get. You can see companies across the industry running into challenges on those. We have a very systematic approach to secure those assets and we'll take the higher impact in our inventory to be able to best serve our customers. And that's a commitment that we make. I don't think that -- we'll end up taking that down as situations stabilize over time. So we don't see that as a long term, we've been very, very focused on our cash flow as, you know, moving that from 75% free cash flow conversion to 90% as an ongoing 90% plus as an ongoing target. We're not changing that at all. And we continue to have a very strong focus on inventory. We just see this as a transient and strategic investment that's paying off for us and it's paying off for our customers. Maybe just we could turn it over to Dave's answer, not just the, the COVID combo test question, but maybe just give some overall color and what was a, a strong momentum in life sciences across both IDs and, and significant demand we're seeing in BDB as well. So, Dave? And Robbie, this is Tom, as, as Dave said, I think we've said from the moment we launched the test that the combo test will be the go to kind of replacement for the base flu test. And so we, we do think flu testing, which was as, as Chris mentioned, was base was completely absent last year that this year we did see flu back as something that was causing infections, we expect that that would continue going forward. Of course, the rate at which that, and the size of that market every year varies each year. But we do believe that that combo test now back in our, our revenue will continue to be persistent as the go-to product for flu test. Yeah. Thank you, Larry, for the question. We've mentioned on several occasions that getting Alaris back on the mark, it is our number one priority. And while we're not providing any updates on, on timing, as, as we had had shared before, we are confident in the resources that we're investing in our submission and the team and the leadership that's tasked to make that happen. And so, we, we still think it's not prudent to predict the timeline given just how inherently complex these submissions are. And particularly that, that certainly applies to our filing. So as we had said, we don't expect clearance in '22, therefore any of our guidance doesn't factor that in, into our numbers for 20 gone what's in medical necessity and we'll continue to provide an update as, as that progresses, but we continue to remain focused on making sure that the FDA has the proper information for us to get clearance on that. And that will remain our focus in terms of the new pump for Europe. No, we remain very excited on that product and it is launching later this, later this year. So absolutely, Yeah. Yeah. Larry, let me make a, maybe a comment overall on supply constraints and then ask Dave to comment on, on Biosciences. We certainly saw record backlogs across the company. So demand was even much higher than what you saw as post in our revenue. And that's across every one of the segments. We saw demand in a number of categories, outstrip our ability to supply, even though we were producing at record levels. And, that's part of what gives us confidence as we look ahead you, we are working each and every day to, to get more out of our plants. We certainly see shortages in longer transit times for raw materials. We see shortages from certain suppliers. We work very aggressively with suppliers to help them secure raw materials. We even go so far as to put our own folks to help run supplier factories in certain cases, but we take, we take that part, those partnerships very seriously to optimize getting product to our customers, but we did end with a, a record backlog across each of the segments. And specifically to Biosciences turn to Dave. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Rick, and, and I'll, I'll start off and then I'll turn it to Chris. So, as we had described that at, at analyst day, we've really rethought how we view our portfolio and our approach to growth. And we, are looking at how we invest in our, in our large essential to healthcare durable core portfolio and fast growing transformative solutions. And those three areas that you mentioned, smart, connected care, new care settings, chronic disease outcomes. And we're, we're really pleased with the performance of both. Hopefully there's something I said in the in my prepared remarks that, that I think is an important takeaway for everyone, which is our for we've had a focus over the last several years of increasing BDS R&D execution capabilities. And you may have heard me say that we reached a peak performance past actually year to date where over 90% on time milestone deliveries and on time launches, that's absolutely top quartile in the industry and something that we're really proud of, the momentum that we've had there. If you look at the pipeline that we shared at analyst day as well, all very much on track, and you're seeing a us announce those executions.

We don't have to go out and buy growth. We've got strong growth in our core, and we're adding value on top of that with 80% of those tuck and M&A focused in those high growth transformative solutionaries. And you heard Chris describe that. So we're gonna continue there. We have a very strong, robust pipeline. We think that actually this men, if anything, is creating incremental opportunities for us as we look ahead, and so we're gonna stay active and disciplined in there, but we do see the opportunity for that to continue to shift BDS growth rate upward. As we look ahead over the next coming years in terms of our decision and how we're using the cash from the, the spin. Let me turn it over to Chris on that. Okay. Thank you operator. And thank you today for, for joining our call and for all of the questions. I hope everyone took away a couple key points from our discussion today. BD is very well positioned to continue to deliver value in uncertain times. And we're seeing that driven by the execution of our BD 2025 strategy, which has led by our innovation driven growth strategy. This is we had strong base business performance across all three segments. We're continuing execution, delivering enhanced margin profile, amidst macroeconomic pressures. We've now successfully completed the spinoff of our diabetes care business as part of our simplification strategy. And today we further increased revenue and EPS guidance on strong results. Despite continued market uncertainty. As we wrap up today's call, I want to just take a moment to thank the 75,000 members of the BD team and those listening today who are working around the clock to ensure production and availability of essential products for patients and providers and who are going above and beyond to support our customers. I want to thank our teams who are working to bring new innovations to market that improve outcomes for patients and providers, and that are reshaping the future of healthcare through both our durable core and transformative solutions. And I want to thank our teams who are working to make BD stronger by simplifying our network, our portfolio, and our processes, as I've said many times while every company is navigating macro challenges, we're focused on being the best in our industry at doing so and to approach every challenge and every opportunity with a growth mindset. And we're doing exactly that. So thank all of you for attending today and be well,"

            "name": "Christopher DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks Tom. So echoing Tom's comments, our Q2 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, we remain committed to supporting our customers and their patients and have made investments in many areas, including inventory, transportation, portfolio, simplification, and innovation, so that we can continue to do our best to ensure continuity of delivering critical healthcare offerings. We are delivering strong performance while simultaneously managing the increasing macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. This balanced approach is helping us make strong progress against both our short and longer term commitments. Turning to our revenue performance, we delivered $5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 10.2% or 9.6% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Our revenue performance is supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions, we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. Price contributed 180 basis points to growth in Q2. While this is well below inflationary levels, it is one of many factors that is enabling our investments to ensure we can continue to deliver our healthcare all offerings to our customers. COVID only testing revenues were $214 million, which is expected to decline from $474 million last year. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times is reflected in the performance across our segments with medical growing 6.4%, life sciences base revenues growing 17.1% and interventional growing 11.2%. Total company base business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the US and Europe, along with mid-single digit growth in Latin America, which helped to offset lower the normal mid-single digit growth in China, which was impacted by restrictions implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID late in the quarter. Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the second quarter growing 6.4%. Strong performance across our pharmaceutical systems, medication management solutions and medication delivery solutions businesses was partially offset by an expected decline in diabetes care. Excluding diabetes care, BD medical revenues grew 7.5%. MDS revenues increased 5.3%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable core products. Performance in MDS reflects execution of our comprehensive vascular access management strategy, including early momentum of our one stick hospital stay, which is driving competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices, particularly in the US. Performance also reflects a tough comparison due to a decline in syringe utilization for vaccinations. MMS revenues grew 7.8%. In our dispensing business, high single digit revenue growth was driven by continued strong worldwide demand for connected medication management solutions in both acute and non-acute care settings. Within our infusion business, revenue growth reflects strong performance in infusion sets driven by increased pump placements outside the US during the course of the COVID pandemic. Farm systems' revenue grew 12.2% driven by continued strong demand for prefill devices supported by our differentiated and expanding supply capacity. Demand for these devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs. Growth was also aided by the expansion of services provided to small and mid-sized pharma customers through the recent acquisition of ZebraSci. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the second quarter. The decline of 4.2% year-over-year is solely due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.1%. IDS revenues declined 6.8%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 21.8%. Performance in our IDS base business includes sales of our new combination flu COVID assays for BD Veritor and BD MAX that were ahead of our expectations and also reflects the soft comparison to the prior year where the flu season was limited. Demand for our combination assays was driven by strong adoption of a broader respiratory panel in timing of dealer stocking. IDS-base revenues were also driven by strong demand for specimen management products and strong performance in our molecular diagnostics portfolio, driven by growth in both BD Core and BD MAX reagents with increased utilization across our larger install base. Biosciences revenues increased 5.6% driven by continued strong demand for research reagents as a result of lab utilization, having returned to more normal pre-COVID levels and increasing adoption of our e-commerce platform. Instrument production in the quarter was limited by supply challenges for electronic components and as a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog. We expect to fulfil those orders over the balance of the year. BD interventional revenues totalled $1.1 billion in the second quarter, growing 11.2%. This reflects strong performance across the segment with double-digit growth in the US and China. Our strong global performance is driving our ability to offset the impact of planned product line discontinuations, particularly in PI and UCC of lower margin and nonstrategic products as part of our portfolio simplification strategy. The segment's result also reflect the easier prior year comparison resulting from the Delta variant. Revenues in surgery grew 17.5%. Again, as a reminder, Q2 reflects a soft comparison to the prior year when revenues declined 7.7%. Excluding the soft comparison, revenues grew in the high single digits driven by hernia, biosurgery and infection prevention including the recent acquisitions of Tepha and Tissuemed. Revenues in peripheral intervention grew 8.5%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the US with strength across our peripheral vascular disease, end stage kidney disease and oncology platforms. We continue to expand our peripheral vascular innovations and are driving strong growth through share gains from our recent acquisition of Straub and Venclose. Urology and critical care revenues grew 8.8% driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in both acute and non-acute cares settings as we continue to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was continued back order recovery in acute urology and continued solid performance in targeted temperature management with our smart, connected care enabled Arctic Sun platform. Now moving to our P&L. In Q2, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations with adjusted net income of $937 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.18. We delivered base gross margin of 55.2% and base operating margin of 24% in Q2. Key drivers of gross margin include a benefit from our strategic portfolio initiatives, including mixed optimization and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. And while inflation was broadly in line with our expectations, we did realize an escalating impact during the quarter that was largely offset by our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory in 2021 that benefited our GP this quarter as a blow-through sales. We leveraged our base SSG&A as a percent of sales by over 200 basis points, driven by our focus on leveraging our base G&A expenses partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in customer shipping. R&D of 6.4% of sales reflects some accelerated phasing of investments and planned increases year over year, consistent with our strategy to support our long-term growth outlook. Our tax rating Q2 was higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of sales. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, cash flows from operations totaled approximately $1.1 billion year to date. Q2 cash flow from operations reflects a higher than normal inventory balance as we may strategic investments to increase stocking of raw materials, such as electronic components, as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. We ended Q2 with a strong cash balance of $3.1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8 times. Our cash balance includes the receipt of a cash distribution from embecta at the end of Q2. In accordance with the tax free nature of the spin and consistent with our capital allocation priorities, including our net leverage goals, we intend to utilize $1 billion of the embecta distribution over the coming quarters for debt pay-down. The remaining $400 million of the distribution provides additional flexibility and will likely be deployed early in fiscal '23 with a bias towards share purchases, subject to market conditions and other strategic considerations. With the spin of embecta now complete, we've achieved our targeted dividend payout ratio of about 30% as we've maintained our dividend. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows, provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A. As Francesca mentioned to assist you with your FY '22 models, we provided our best estimates of the impact of the spin on certain line items for Q2 in today's slide presentation. We estimate a $260 million impact to revenue, a 100 basis points to adjusted gross margin and 160 basis points to adjusted operating margin and $0.45 to adjusted EPS. Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions; first, some macro considerations that support our guidance; while we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes that continued easing of COVID 19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Regarding China specifically, we expect to mitigate the impact from the current lockdowns over the balance of the fiscal year as we are assuming the restrictions will ease in May with recovery ramping up through fiscal Q3. In addition, our guidance assumes that the core congestion does begin to ease and will not have a lasting impact on our China business and other markets. While there could be additional lockdowns in China and other markets, our guidance assumes countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients. Additionally, we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year and into next fiscal year, but we are not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds. While these pressures are meaningful, we believe we are on track with our margin recovery initiatives and will continue to proactively manage this. We expect to be able to largely offset these incremental inflationary impacts, given our strong performance in Q2, an increased focus in the back half of our fiscal year to execute our company-wide mitigation initiatives. As our first half results include diabetes care, we are providing guidance today on a legacy BD basis that includes diabetes care. So you have a like-for-like comparison versus our February guidance. Then we are also providing remain guidance for the full fiscal year, which excludes diabetes care in all four quarters, along with the spin impact for each guidance metric. This is also laid out on the FY '22 guidance summary slide in the guidance section in our RemainCo earnings presentation. As a reminder, going forward, our first half diabetes care results will be reflected as discontinued operations, and we will only be discussing RemainCo performance. Now moving to our updated guidance for are fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our three segments, given our performance and momentum in our base business and thus on a legacy BD basis, before adjusting for the diabetes care spin, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. We now expect legacy BD base news to grow 6.75% to 7.75% on an FX neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase of a 100 basis points from our previous guidance of 5.75% to 6.75% growth. On a RemainCo basis, we expect base revenues to grow 7.25% to 8.25% on an FX neutral basis. This is an acceleration of approximately 50 basis points over BD legacy growth as our diabetes care business was a negative contributor to growth rates. The spin impact also includes a small contribution of revenues BD will earn in connection with agreements with embecta. For COVID-only testing, we continue to assume approximately $450 million in revenue. As expected, testing demand has slowed and our full-year COVID-only revenue expectations are waited to the first half of the year. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points or about $400 million to total company revenues on both a BD Legacy and RemainCo basis on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of 75 basis points or $150 million compared to our prior guidance and is driven by of the strengthening of the US dollar. So all in, we are increasing our legacy BD total reported revenue guidance by $50 million to a range of $19.6 billion to $19.8 billion. On a RemainCo basis, we expect total revenues of $18.5 billion to $18.7 billion. On a Legacy BD basis, we still expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 200 basis points over 21.7% in fiscal '21. Despite a more challenging macro environment anticipated over the back half of the year, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the competence that we will be able to offset the incremental inflationary pressures. On a RemainCo basis, the embecta spin enhances our anticipated base margin expansion by approximately 50 basis points. And as a result, we expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 250 basis points in comparison to 19.6% in FY '21 as recasted. We also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models; on a RemainCo basis, we expect $60 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest other which reflects a minimal benefit from the use of embecta proceeds compared to our legacy BD expectation of $50 million to $75 million. On a Legacy BD basis, we now expect an effective tax rate of 13% to 14% for the full year compared to 12.5% to 13.5% previously due to geographic mix as reflected in our revised guidance. For RemainCo, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14.5%, which reflects the tax rate, excluding our diabetes care business. Our updated guidance still assume share purchases that at a minimum offset, any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume material change in shares outstanding. All in on a Legacy BD basis, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.85 and $13 compared to $12.80 to $13 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.025 at the midpoint. The core drivers of the increase include $0.125 [ph] driven by the momentum and strength in our base business with the series of strategic mitigation actions we discussed earlier expected the largely offset increased inflationary pressures and a $0.05 headwind from a higher effective tax rate. So operationally, this is an increase of $0.750. We expect an estimated incremental negative impact from currency of about $0.05 resulting in a $0.025 increase to our adjusted reported earnings guidance at the midpoint. On a RemainCo basis, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $11.15 to $11.30 cents. This reflects an adjustment from the embecta spin of about a $1.70. This accounts for a half year of TSA income of about $35 million that will be realized in the second half of the fiscal year and recorded in other operating income on an adjusted basis and it includes the contribution from supply agreements, with embecta and the benefit from financing, which are both expected to be minimal. As you think about the TSA income next year for your models, it would not be accurate to double the half year of TSA income as the services provided and income received will decline over time. As a reminder, BD shareholders received embecta shares upon completion of the spin. As you think of the commitments we made during our Investor Day on a BD RemainCo basis, our long-term targeted growth profile has been enhanced and increases our confidence in our ability to deliver our 5.5% plus base revenue growth target. Additionally, we are now targeting more than 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through fiscal year '25 against the re-casted fiscal year '21 margin. And notably, based on what we know today, all things being equal, we think BD RemainCo can deliver the absolute pre-pandemic operating margin level of legacy BD, which was about 25% by the end of that same time period. As we previously shared, this will lend itself nicely to double-digit EPS growth and a strong value proposition. As you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of your RemainCo base revenue and earnings. We continue to expect base revenue growth to be fairly rateable in the back half of the year. Regarding our margins and P&L, first on a year-over-year basis for Q3, we expect significant improvement in base operating margin compared the re-casted 17.7% in the prior year. Additionally, we expect the Q3 year-over-year improvement to be larger than what we delivered in Q2. Sequentially from Q2 to Q3, we expect a modest step down due to a stronger Q2, primarily driven by product mix most notably our flu COVID combo test and increased inflationary pressures in the second half. As a result, Q3 is now projected to be the low watermark for the year. In Q4, we expect the impact of increased inflation on our business to continue. However, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives flowing through. In addition, we continue to see our SSG&A and RD dollars relatively evenly spread over the remainder of the year, which will drive strong operating leverage on Q4's higher revenue dollars. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, our average tax rate for the balance of the year is about 14.5%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters. So in summary, we are advancing our BD 2025 strategic objectives. Our underlying business is strong as evidenced by our strong base revenue and earnings performance. We remain focused on execution and our confident in delivering against our performance goals, despite navigating a complex macro environment as evidenced by our updated guidance, which increases the midpoint of both our reported revenue and adjusted EPS. Further, we are well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable value with our long-term commitments enhancing with the completion of the spin. I'll now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. I appreciate the question. It's Chris. Hope you're well. Your math is correct. So again, our first half growth extremely strong here at about 9% on a year-to-date basis. Obviously we had benefited from some one-time items, but we also overcome some headwinds in that period too. I think when we talked last quarter and we would frame this quarter as probably from call it underlying adjusting for some of those puts and takes around seven-ish percent growth, the back half, you're right, 5.5% growth. I think there's a couple things to contemplate there. Of course, China, there will be a pretty significant impact in Q3 as they recover. We expect that recovery -- the recovery started in May. We expect that to ramp through June and we expect to make the majority of that up in the back half. Additionally, we do have some comps as you think of the back half of the year in particular our life sciences business. We did have our Triplex launch there. So if you look at Q4 that was a peak performance period for that business. So there's a couple kind of comps along with the China situation that will cycle through Q3 into Q4 to consider there in the back half, but 5.5% growth is consistent with our long-term outlook of 5.5-plus on top of a front half of 9%. So all in a really strong year. I think the other thing I would point to, if you look at the quarter performance from a top line standpoint, we actually increased our organic guide more than the beep on the base business in Q2. So it actually implies stronger second half performance. So we actually did strengthen our second half outlook, despite some of those headwinds that I noted. So hopefully that helps. Yeah, it's a great question. Obviously, to your point, there's a lot of moving parts and one, if you remember our Investor Day guide, we actually stripped out testing. We see testing as something that'll move more to kind of the endemic opportunity here that gets more embedded in the base. So we need to see how that plays out this year. Obviously I think an important caveat just to see how COVID dynamics, the macro-inflationary environment plays out as well. So I think some big considerations, but what I would point you to over the long term horizon, definitely over the long term horizon, obviously there's can be fluctuations year-to-year, but you're seeing it play out this year. One definitely the enhanced growth profile, the five-five plus we're well north of that this year, given our strong focus on innovation and R&D, the benefit we're getting from tuck in acquisitions. As a matter of fact, just as a reminder, you'll see that we did provide the one-time lift associated with the tuck-in acquisitions, which was roughly 60 basis points. That was never part of our five, five plus. What was part of our five, five plus was taking those acquisitions and growing them. These are profitable double-digit growth opportunities. They're actually enhancing our growth profile on a year-to-date basis by about 30 basis points above that 60 basis points. So true organic growth once we've cycled over the anniversary. So I think we're going to continue to focus on our growth strategy. We remain confident in the five, five plus the spin of diabetes certainly enhances that confidence. You did see a 50 basis point lift here, just in this year alone, as a result of that. As we've talked about, that was a drag on growth. As you think of operating margin, I shared a couple key things. One, this was a very important year for us is when we had committed the 400 basis points, we were going to deliver half of that in one year. So doing that in the face of the inflationary environment we're in with inflation, normal inflation being 2%, we're talking about 8%, 4X inflation happening is quite a testament to cost improvement. I don't know if you picked up in the talk track, but we did commit that we are going to do better than 400 basis points over that timeframe. Not only that, we think that by 2025, we can get back to the legacy operating margin of about 25%. And if you ask how we're going to do that, if you think of all the structural change we've made this year, it's a compensating for the inflation. We've actually done more cost improvement and enhancement through our simplification programs. That are actually creating more underlying value that we expect to carry over the long term. So definitely we feel really good about our long-term Investor Day outlook, of course, assuming this environment that we're in at some point kind of settles back to more normal here, hopefully as we exit this year into next year. There may be a little bit of typical choppiness from year-to-year within that. But we certainly expect to deliver continued strong growth in each year and strong margin improvement this year. Yeah, no, thanks. I appreciate the question. Look, again, I think as it relates to '23 it's a little premature to give specifics at this stage. I think certainly though with, call it my 200 basis points delivered this year, 250 basis points, if you adjust for Embecta. And with -- to get to what I said by the end of 2025, to get back to the 25% operating margin legacy, you're going to expect kind of a relatively ratable call it glide path to get there. The only thing I would point out is I do think '23 will be a transition period, because you're still going to have the structural impact of inflation that's been ongoing, that'll carry over into '23. So I do view that a little bit as a transition year and you'll get more lift as the environment normalizes over that time is how I would probably think of a ramp curve if that makes sense. I think the only build is just to reinforce I think the strong underlying growth profile is really creating opportunities to drive some of that simplification. For example, the strategic skew rationalization efforts, right? We're absorbing that within our growth rate. It unlocks value in the form of margin, drives enhanced mix, new product innovation launches is a way that will more look to create value in the marketplace and get value back for that versus thinking of things just as price. It's really a bigger picture though. The price is actually extremely modest relative to the level of inflation but thanks. Yeah. Thanks Robbie, for the question, let me let me, let me just anchor on kind of the full year and then I'll provide you some set. I can second half context, and of course as always we can engage further in the discussion. But in terms of the guide adjustment, the best way to think of it is sort of the a 100 basis points of organic growth. We actually increased our top line by about $180 million at the midpoint. If you look at the EPS walk that we had provided, we're dropping about just under $0.13 through, which is basically at a BD margin drop through with that raise. So nothing's changed. We've actually reconfirmed our margin profile as a result, we've taken the guide up for the, the stronger growth profile above actually what was delivered in Q2. So from a full year standpoint everything remains intact. There there's no currency really just drops through it at a margin rate. The margin obviously fluctuates based on currency mix dynamics and/or margin mix in those respective markets. I don't think there's anything unexpected there. As a matter of fact, the currency that we talked about that was a carryover benefit into the year has played out as expected. So I don't think there's anything there to contemplate and then I think as you think of second half margins what you can expect to see there will be a small sequential decline on Op margin from Q2 to Q3 is really primarily driven by the fact that last year Q2 to Q3, you had nearly a 250 basis point decline from Q2 to Q3, and it was our low watermark, and we're actually going to be increasing the improvement in operating margin in the quarter year-over-year, versus what we did this quarter. We did 180 basis points this quarter. We will have a step increase there. So you'll see it relatively stable, but a small dropdown accounting for that low point base that we're jumping off of from last year. And then we'll continue to increase from there is sort of the glide as you think of the second half. But again, so if I tie this into your question about going forward, I think the important way to think about this is on track for the 200 basis point of margin improvement for the full year 250 basis points adjusted when you do the pro forma for embecta, which was half of what we said as part of our full year Investor Day commitment. Quite a big progression in one year, especially in phase of the inflationary pressures, which should set us up nicely over the long term. Yeah, I can, I can take the second one maybe holistically. There will be, as, as noted in some of the public documents there will be various third party agree between Veta and BD. There will be a small contribution to top line, which would contemplate more supply agreements. We highlighted that as part of the 50 basis points lift. There was a small contribution. There there'll be a full year benefit next year. Obviously, but again, it was, it was not substantive. We had the TSA we said it was worth $35 million this year. It won't quite double next year because what's typical in the spin. Really the spirit of the TSA is to support and beta standing up as a standalone public company. And it gives us an opportunity to support them. We leverage our, our stranded costs to do that. So basically it keeps us whole from a supporting BECTA stranded cost standpoint. And then we, we shed those down as the TSA goes down in parallel. So there's no impact on a net basis from an income. So you should expect the 35 to lift next year, but not quite double, Yeah. Thank, thank you Tom. Robbie, thanks for the question. I mean, just pulling back a little bit, I mean, just want to recognize the life science segment colleagues around the world for just a tremendous quarter. And that's two successive quarters now, 17% growth excluding testing. If I talk about the test, just the overall testing dynamics at that highest level, so, you remember that we have the COVID testing piece, which is like the single antigen and molecular tests. And you hear Chris talk about, that was 214 million for us in the quarter 400 million year to date. I think you'll recall that we'd also said that, we were biasing our sort of all COVID performance to the, to the first half of the year because we are seeing Moderate some moderation in testing. We expect that moderation to continue through the balance of the year. So that overall testing dynamics are playing out with what we said. I mean, we're very close to 90% of the full year testing expectation for the combo. This is obviously the flu and COVID assay both on our max and our veal platforms. We've not given that number specifically because that's, that's in a mix of a lot of puts and takes in the overall base business. There was growth there as, as Chris had said, if you think about that as a, as a compared to the prior to the same period prior year, that's where we saw some of the growth come from. We do expect from a strategy perspective going forward, we do see value in the overall COVID combo portfolio. As we think Colby will move to more of an endemic situation. It's just too early to call out as to what that number would be for the, for the full year, even getting into early Q1 '23 when nobody knows what the dynamics of the flu are going to be right now. Yeah. Thanks David and Robbie, maybe just a couple other small things to just give you a little color in terms of what would've comprised the, the revenue there, obviously there was almost no flu season last year, so you kind of got back to flu season. Additionally obviously the combo has a slightly higher value proposition. You benefited from that. Additionally there was a little bit of stocking giving. It was, it was new and you did have a lot of testing demand in that period where it was hard to get access to tests. So those were sort of the factors that, that played into where we were. But again, adjusting for that really strong underlying, especially in the back of still having back water in, in certain areas, both in life sciences and total. Yeah. And Rob, we just one just on strategy piece, just one more piece, there would be, we're very committed to just looking at what, what are the unmet needs for, our patients around the world on a go forward basis. So we, we are committed to, developing more combo tests and we talk to the analyst day around the potential for an at home combo test, using the, the platform that we acquired in, in December. So the innovation piece of the strategy still continues and, and obviously as timelines firm up on that, we'll commune as it gets better though. Larry, thanks for the question. So we, we've got, I mean, when you look at the backlog overall, we, we've not quantified it in terms of, the absolute number of instruments. This is, this is an instrument topic for us. It primarily sort of relates to the clinical side of the business. But as Chris had said in his in remarks, we anticipate with the supply with some of the supply securements that we've done the procurement leverage that we've been able to get. We expect this to clear up over the course of the year. So it just becomes a timing topic for us in the year. And the team is very confident about that. What we are doing to sort of mitigate any short term is we're obviously working on an allocation strategy. the research instrument base is, is still very strong. So we're prioritizing what we have to get everything out. And then we're just driving hard and aggressive on procurements Of those chips and those electronic components. We have a lot of the instruments sort of ready, built, ready to go. So as those things come in, we'll just execute and chip in the back half of the year. Go ahead, Simon. Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Yeah. Rick, thanks for the question. So first of all, the, the tax free nature of the spin requires you to think about allocating between either debt and or share purchase. What we actually outlined in the script was we're going to prioritize a billion dollars of debt. Paydown, that's very consistent actually with our capital allocation strategy, maintaining a strong net leverage ratio, which gives us a lot of financial flex to actually support the strategy that, that Tom just outlined the, the balance of about 400 million plus will be opportunistic about. We do have a bias for that smaller remaining portion towards Sherry purchase, but of course will be dependent on market conditions and, and other strategic considerations. And then just to double down a little bit on, so that that's discreet and separate decision that, that we're taking associated with the spin beyond that our capital allocation strategy remains exactly intact as, as Tom articulated the most important thing. Actually that I think he shared is we're doing all this from a position of strength, underlying strength. It allows us to be extremely disciplined and identify S that have strong margin profile, strong growth profiles strategically fit against those three irreversible forces drive transformative solutions. So we will look to continue to drive strong cash flow with, by the way, higher R&D investments. We of course have continued to prioritize our, our dividend which actually the payout ratio know increased post spin another value to BD shareholders. And then we expected about one and a half to 2 billion of excess cash after doing all of those things where tuck in M&A would continue to absolutely be our, our priority. But importantly, we did agree that we would make sure at minimum we would do repurchases that avoid any dilution from share base comp. So that's the capital allocation strategy that we're, we're executing now. Thanks."

            "content": "Good morning, Rick. Listen, fir firstly again, just reflection on the quarter really solid quarter across all, all three of our business units and, and, the soft compare in, in some areas certainly helped helped us, but I'm still, very proud of the team for executing across are broad and complex and clinically relevant portfolio. And then you might recall from, from analyst day all the plans that we had and please to say that all, all those, you know programs that we that we shared with the broad community at analyst day, that they, they are all on track now specifically about perform in, in the quarter in China, in particular the peripheral inter intervention business is extremely strong in China. And you, you you'll have heard us say in the past that BDI in China has doubled in, in revenue since since bar was acquired by BDI. And that has been led by, by peripheral intervention and the oncology business in particular. We, we had some background challenges with Encore probes over the past several months, and that's, that's begun to alleviate, we had a, a backlog in, in sterilization and that's begun to alleviate and that has certainly helped drive our business forward. But even in, in ESKD and [indiscernible] in China they, they performed a extra ordinary well in the last quarter as they do as they do very, very frequently and that performance NPI was also reflected in surgery. And, and to a lesser extent in, in UCC as well now, moving forward our, our outlook for the future, as, as we're, we're focused on, on innovation and trying to out execute the competition. And, I've heard Tom mention in his, in his prepared remarks about the relaunch of the, of Ben Novo. So we've just brought that back into the market in the last in the last two weeks. And, and that's supported by the three year vernacular data which, which I think is unparalleled data in the in the Venus space. We're super pleased with the response from our sales team and our customers to the relaunch of that product. And that will certainly be a driver this year and next year, particularly when we couple that with the with the expected clearance anticipated clearance of the thrombectomy catheter which we hope to receive this quarter or, or next quarter. And that will put us in a very, very strong position in the venous space the track biopsy device, the Tom refer to as well, that's, that's due for launch imminently. And then in our UCC business the puric platform continues to, to, I would say, exceed our expectations and in late Q3, early Q4 we do expect to launch the mail version of puric, which we hold will be a, a driver of growth. And then finally a comment on our, our acquisitions NAFA acquisition has really performed very, very well. The tissue made acquisition, which was a acquisition for the China biosurgery market that we hope to bring to other geographies, but the Chinese team again, has executed on that. And then and then van close as well has performed very, very well in in the PI space. And just referring back to TIFA and, and the plans that we shared with you about our, our, our anticipated expansion to the breast space over the next several, several years now, we do expect to begin enrolling patients in a pilot study here in Q4 in one of the categories that we're investigating for breast. So a lot of, a lot of momentum behind the PDI team across all businesses and in the usual ways innovation in organic M&A and executing the field."

Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for a Q&A session by our segment presidents, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of the Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment.  Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in today's presentation slides and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website.  Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically note it as a calendar period.  I would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines term you'll hear today, such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results excluding COVID-only testing.  With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Polen: Thanks, Francesca. Welcome aboard. We're very happy to have you on the team. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q1. It reflects the continued execution of our BD2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business. We made meaningful progress and delivered on our revenue, margin, earnings and cash flow goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy. Our performance, along with the progress we are making delivering across our key priorities, gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance for both our base business and COVID testing.  We were able to deliver these results in an uncertain market environment, demonstrating demand across our broad portfolio of products essential to patient care, along with BD's unique ability to deliver strong performance in the face of an ongoing global pandemic. The market impacts from COVID-19 dynamics continue to be in focus, particularly in the health care sector. However, we've witnessed a global health care system that's more agile and better prepared as each new variant has emerged.  In Q1, health care utilization levels continued at rates similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, remaining slightly below pre-pandemic levels until mid-December, then only declining modestly as a result of Omicron.  While we saw some slowdowns in deferrable procedures in the back half of December in certain regions due to hospital-imposed restrictions and staffing constraints, overall, our customers were able to continue to provide care to support patients and sustain a solid base of deferrable procedures. These challenges to procedure levels had minimal impact on our business in the first quarter. In addition, we saw routine lab testing returned to normal levels in Q1 and research lab activity remains strong.  With that said, as we look ahead, there are some pressures today related to staffing constraints that are impacting the delivery of some deferrable procedures, coupled with supply chain dynamics. We continue to watch these market dynamics closely.  Despite the continued recovery, uncertainty and inflationary pressures, I'm pleased with our team's focus on execution. Our segments are delivering strong profitable growth and our strategic initiatives to enhance margins are progressing well. As seen in our results, we're off to a strong start, being very active and intentional in executing our inflation-mitigation initiatives across procurement, shipping and continuous improvements in our plants as well as appropriate pricing-related actions.  Further, we intend to be best-in-class in navigating the current inflationary environment. We see signs of continued pressure on shipping, labor, raw materials and electronic components over the remainder of the year since our last guidance update. However, we believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery, and we expect to offset any inflationary impacts through various cost-containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1 that will enable us to deliver on our full year objectives.  I'll now give a high-level summary of our financial performance. Q1 revenues of $5 billion reflect continued strong momentum in our base business. And through our focused execution, we grew base business revenues 8.3% in the first quarter. We also saw increased demand for our professional and at-home COVID tests relative to our previously communicated guidance, which was fueled by the Omicron variant.  As expected, in comparison to the prior year, COVID-only testing revenues declined, driven by lower antigen test pricing and volumes and a number of new entrants to the market with over 40 EUAs now granted in the U.S.  We have also continued to execute our cash flow initiatives, and we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $700 million. Our strong cash flow continues to enable investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, which are fueling our BD2025 strategy.  In Q1, we closed 3 acquisitions, Scanwell, Tissuemed and Venclose. And just this week, we announced the acquisition of Cytognos, whose differentiated flow cytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer, bring an important addition to our biosciences business. These acquisitions advance our strategy to expand in higher-growth spaces that complement our durable portfolio and bring new transformative solutions across smart connected care, new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes.  Our disciplined capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to deploy capital towards value-creating opportunities in both R&D and M&A for future growth as well as return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate.  As we look across the balance of FY '22, our Q1 momentum and focus on execution are driving our strong FY '22 outlook. As we have communicated, we see our growth profile as derisked as we're leaders in areas of health care that remain in high demand and are driving base revenues. We have strengthened our growth profile through new product launches and acquired assets in the higher-growth spaces that are adding to our performance. And we continue to support increased testing demand. While we expect the recent demand surge to be temporary, in the event that COVID-19 cases persist longer than anticipated, our testing portfolio provides a natural hedge against deferrable procedure softness and other COVID-related headwinds.  In addition to our derisked growth profile, we're also confident in our ability to improve our gross margins given the strong progress we've made to date through focused execution against our detailed plans to offset inflationary pressures and deliver cost improvements. All of this gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance while remaining appropriately prudent given the current uncertain environment.  So turning to innovation. We remain focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. During the quarter, we progressed our innovation pipeline, launching several new products. Examples include BD COR, where we recently launched our molecular MX module, which fully completes the CE Mark system. The MX is built off of our BD MAX assay technology, which will allow us to leverage the BD MAX menu of infectious disease tests into the high throughput lab segment.  We also launched BD Kiestra IdentifA, which received the 510(k) clearance this quarter and is designed to fully automate and integrate the preparation of microbiology bacterial identification testing using smart connected robotics.  Beyond these achievements, we also hit several milestones across our pipeline. We submitted the 510(k) to the FDA for our TREK bone biopsy device. The TREK biopsy system will provide interventional radiologists with an easier and faster way to perform bone biopsies without the need to use multiple devices, thus reduces the cost per procedure, inventory needs and reduces procedure time.  Our Pyxis ES version 1.7 software is now live in limited commercial release at 4 sites in anticipation of full commercial launch. This software adds new capabilities like enhanced automation and controlled substance management via improved connectivity with our C2 Safe offering and enables deeper integration of pharmacy and nursing areas.  We're also very proud of our new BD FACS Discover S8 CellSorter, which is currently profiled as a cover story of the January issue of Science Magazine. The S8 is a landmark advancement in flow cytometry that has the potential to transform a wide range of disciplines from immunology and genomics research to cell-based therapeutics. For the first time, we can sort cells at high speeds while separating cells not only based on which antibodies or other markers we see, but also based on new imaging parameters. To put this leapfrog technology in perspective, the most advanced flow cytometers today can analyze and sort cells based on 3 non-fluorescent parameters and have processing speeds of up to 15 megabytes per second. The S8 analyze and sorts on 11 nonfluorescent parameters and has processing speeds of up to 2,000 megabytes per second. We encourage you to visit bdbiosciences.com/celvieu to learn more about this exciting new innovation.  I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy. To that end, I am pleased to report that our Board of Directors recently approved the spin-off of embecta, which is scheduled to occur on April 1. We remain on track for a successful embecta spin. We continue to believe the spin is a significant value-creating opportunity for our shareholders as both BD and embecta are well positioned for success.  embecta will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher revenue growth.  Further, we expect the spin-off will not have an impact on the long-term growth targets we laid out at Investor Day. And instead, we expect it to enhance both our sales and earnings growth profile and create an opportunity for additional shareholder value.  Finally, regarding our progress on advancing our ESG strategy, which serves as a framework through which we address the most relevant ESG issues for our company and our stakeholders. We continue to make strong progress against our goals. We launched our inaugural 2021 Global Inclusion Diversity and Equity report, in which we shared our ID&E foundation, strategy and actions towards the healthy workforce and communities pillar of our 2030 ESG goals. BD's commitment to ID&E sets a new standard for how the company will work together to innovate new products and solutions, and we firmly believe that the more diverse people and perspectives there are at the table, the better outcomes we can produce to deliver what's next in health care.  We also published our second Annual Cybersecurity Report to update stakeholders on the state of health care cybersecurity, BD's impacts on advancing cybersecurity maturity and anticipated trends for 2022. We're very proud to be the first and only med tech company to publish a cybersecurity report. Through our leadership position in health care cybersecurity in our annual report, we're working to address cybersecurity challenges specific to our industry.  We also continue to receive external recognition of our ESG efforts, including just recently being named one of America's Most Just Companies in the Annual JUST 100 Ranking and ranking in the top 3 within our industry.  I'm proud of the progress we're making advancing both our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. The actions we're taking are driving excellent momentum. We believe we are well positioned to deliver and create value for all of our stakeholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q1 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. We are enhancing our growth profile through the portfolio and investment actions we are taking, while also executing on margin improvement and inflationary-mitigation programs to deliver our long-term margin expansion targets and double-digit earnings growth profile. To that end, I'd like to recognize our associates across supply chain for their contributions. We have an incredible team around the world that is not only addressing the challenges that all companies are facing in today's environment, but they are excelling and driving performance.  Turning to our revenue performance. We delivered $5 billion in revenue in the first quarter comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 8.3%, and 7.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. COVID-only testing revenues were $185 million, which, as expected, declined from $866 million last year, as this was our highest revenue quarter for COVID testing last year given higher pricing and volumes. The year-over-year decline in total company revenues of 5.9% is entirely attributable to the decline in testing revenues.  BD is uniquely positioned to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations, as demonstrated by the revenue performance across our segments, with BD Medical growing 6%, Life Sciences based revenues growing over 17% and Interventional growing 3.8%.  Total company base business growth was also strong regionally, with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America.  Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the first quarter, growing 6%, led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses.  MDS revenues increased 7.3%, reflecting strong demand for our durable core products, particularly in the U.S., driven by competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. Our leadership position in these markets allow us to provide a strong value proposition to our customers in terms of the breadth of our portfolio as well as the cost and quality of our products. Importantly, as input costs such as resins have increased, we've been able to take appropriate price actions and accelerate cost mitigation programs while continuing to invest in innovation to support our strong value proposition.  In MMS, revenues were down slightly due to the difficult prior-year comparison given the high number of infusion pump placements last year in the U.S. and Europe to support COVID-related hospital needs. Excluding this impact, our MMS business reflects continued execution of our medication management strategy, which drove strong demand worldwide for our dispensing solutions. This was particularly evident in the U.S., where we saw another strong quarter of customer signings. The traction we are getting reflects the value our Pyxis platform provides our customers.  Revenue growth of 1.6% in Diabetes Care reflects our category leadership position. Growth was aided by the timing of certain orders.  Pharm Systems revenue grew nearly 18%, driven by continued strong demand for pre-fillable devices. Growth was also enabled by our focused execution on capacity expansion that allowed us to fulfill certain orders earlier than originally anticipated. Demand for pre-filled devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs.  BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the first quarter. The decline of 24.8% year-over-year is solely due to lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.2%, with licensing revenue in IDS contributing about 400 basis points to the segment's base growth and about 100 basis points to the total company based revenue growth.  In IDS, base business revenues had strong growth of 20.3%, including about 600 basis points from licensing revenue. Performance was driven by our specimen management, microbiology and molecular platforms as routine lab testing returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Growth in BD MAX IVD assays was also strong, reflecting the leverage we are getting on the larger installed base. Performance in our base business includes sales of our combination flu COVID assay that were in line with our expectations. Indications are the respiratory season will be a normal to low flu season.  Biosciences revenues increased 9%, driven by strong demand for research solutions as a result of lab utilization returning to normal levels and continued research on COVID variants. Contributing to Life Sciences Q1 growth were the 2 new FACSSymphony instruments that we launched in FY '21. As the evolution of flow cytometry continues to move from large labs to more midsized independent labs, we now provide a complete suite of analyzers for researchers from the benchtop A1 to the A5 SE, our first spectral analyzer that enables researchers to do even high-parameter cellular analysis to gain broader insights into pioneering new discoveries and treatments for cancer and other immune-related conditions.  Our new e-commerce site also contributed to growth in Q1. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the first quarter, growing 3.8%. BDI's performance reflects strong growth in Surgery and UCC. Q1 performance was impacted by temporary supply chain disruptions, and consistent with our ReCoDe initiative, product line discontinuations of lower-margin products in our PI and UCC businesses. While these strategic discontinuations create a temporary headwind to revenue growth, it demonstrates our commitment to simplifying our portfolio and enhancing margins.  We had a strong start to the year in our Surgery business, with revenue growth of nearly 9% despite some modest slowdowns towards the end of December due to Omicron. Strength in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in advanced reconstruction and repair, with strength in hernia as deferrable procedures recovered, and the recent acquisition of Tepha.  Tepha provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform, but more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.  Double-digit growth in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in infection prevention was also driven by the recovery of deferrable procedures and continued market adoption of Sterile BD ChloraPrep.  Revenues in Peripheral Intervention declined 3.1% as a result of a product recall from fiscal '21 and the previously mentioned supply disruptions and product line discontinuations that support our margin enhancement goals. However, we saw continued acceleration in our atherectomy platform in China as we have leveraged the capabilities of our sales force. We are also experiencing positive momentum from our recent acquisition of Venclose.  Urology & Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for PureWick in our acute urology portfolio. We're also seeing continued adoption of our PureWick solutions in the home as we advance our strategy to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was remediation of Q4's temporary supply disruption within acute urology.  Now moving to our P&L. We delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations in Q1, with adjusted net income of $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.64. We had strong execution of our margin enhancement initiatives in Q1 and delivered base business gross margin of 55.4% and operating margin of 24.3%. We remain on track to deliver our full year base margin goals, with our base margin performance in Q1 ahead of our expectations for the quarter and also above our full year base margin expectations, due to our ability to realize some of our inflation mitigation and pricing initiatives sooner than we previously anticipated.  In addition, our Q1 base business operating margin also included a benefit of about 40 basis points from licensing revenues in Life Sciences that was included in our full year plan. Excluding the licensing revenue, base gross and operating margin would have been nearly 55% and 24%, respectively.  Other key drivers of gross margin in Q1 include a benefit from increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth and, as expected, favorable FX we experienced in 2021 but was recorded in inventory and benefited our GP this quarter when sold. We did realize a negative impact from inflation in the quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations and was partially offset by our cost improvement and inflation mitigation actions, which are occurring as planned. We are making very good progress with strong sequential improvement and our full year base gross margin improvement goal remains on track despite continued inflationary pressures.  SSG&A was in line with expectations and increased year-over-year, driven by variable expenses, including selling and commissions, and inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping, that we have previously shared. The increase in SSG&A as a percent of sales is a function of lower testing sales. However, we did leverage SSG&A versus our base revenue, which is contributing to our base operating margin improvement.  R&D increased year-over-year, consistent with our strategy to invest more to support our long-term growth outlook. As anticipated and communicated on our prior earnings call, our tax rate benefited from the timing of discrete items, resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.  Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $700 million in the first quarter. We ended Q1 with a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Our cash balance reflects our strategic investments in M&A during the quarter.  Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A.  During Q1, we invested in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline. We also invested over $400 million in 3 additional tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond.  Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, the macro considerations that support our guidance. While we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the stabilization of deferrable procedures and no significant disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Additionally, we see signs of continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year, with some stabilization by the end of the year. However, we believe we have a clear path to margin recovery, and we expect to offset any incremental inflation impact through various cost containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1. Our guidance doesn't contemplate a more significant step increase in market-driven supply chain and inflationary disruption.  A few comments on testing-specific assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays. We anticipate a normal to light flu season based on what we've seen so far from the CDC surveillance reports.  Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations and, thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance.  While we aren't providing segment-specific items, relative to our revised total company base growth outlook, we expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below and our Life Sciences and Interventional segment growth to be slightly above total company growth.  We now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75% on an FX-neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 5% to 6% growth and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and confidence in the strength and resilience of our base portfolio, and our Q1 acquisitions, which account for about 25 basis points of the increase.  For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming $450 million in revenue, which is a little more than double our original expectation of $200 million. As we communicated last quarter, higher testing revenues position us well to manage through this period of uncertainty and also provide the potential to create value through reinvestment in our business. Given our increased testing revenue expectations, we currently plan to reinvest a portion of the testing profits over the balance of the year, but we'll ensure they are value-creating opportunities and would not invest at a level that would result in our full year testing margins dropping below our base margins. Should those investment opportunities not materialize as anticipated, we would allow the incremental profits to flow through.  Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 125 basis points or about $250 million to total company revenues. This is an incremental 75 basis point headwind compared to our prior view.  All in with our base revenue, COVID-only testing revenue and the illustrative currency impact, we now expect reported revenues in the range of $19.55 billion to $19.75 billion in fiscal '22, compared to $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion previously announced.  We still expect operating margins in our base business to improve by approximately 200 basis points over our fiscal '21 base operating margin of 21.7%.  Given the planned reinvestment, we also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models. We now expect $50 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest other or an incremental $25 million benefit. We still expect an effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% for the full year. Our guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at a minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation.  All in, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.80 and $13, which is an increase of $0.50 at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $12.30 to $12.50. This includes absorbing the negative impact of currency, which we estimate to be about $0.10. The increase reflects our strong Q1 base business performance and our expectations for increased COVID testing net of reinvestment.  As a reminder, our fiscal '22 guidance continues to include our Diabetes business. As Tom mentioned, the embecta spin has now been approved by the Board of Directors. As we proceed towards the spin date, I want to provide a few reminders Restated financials for RemainCo will not be made public until the completion of the spinoff. Given the higher but declining margin profile of embecta, one should expect BD margins to be lower after they're restated. However, off the restated FY '21 financials, we are still targeting about 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through FY '25. BD is expected to receive a distribution of approximately $1.44 billion, equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We remain excited for what's ahead for embecta and making this a successful and value-creating opportunity for everyone.  As you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of our base revenue and earnings. Regarding sales, we remain confident in the durable nature of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying sales.  In Q2, we expect some impact from Omicron on hospital staffing and procedures. But recall, Q2 is a relatively easy compare due to the significant COVID resurgence we experienced in Q2 of fiscal '21. As a result, we anticipate base revenue growth in Q2 to be above our full year guidance range, with the remaining quarters being equally balanced.  Regarding our margins and P&L, as I noted, Q1 had the benefit from licensing, which added about 40 basis points to operating margin, which will not repeat in Q2. While we expect improvement versus the prior year, we also previously shared that Q2 would be the quarter with the largest inflationary impact.  So given those 2 dynamics, you would expect a sequential step down in margin, and we expect Q2 to represent the low watermark for base operating margin for the year.  We remain well on track to achieve our base operating margin guidance of approximately 200 basis points improvement. As we progress through the second half of the fiscal year, in Q3, we expect the impact of inflation on our business to stabilize and see a modest pickup of cost improvement and price-related benefits flowing through, with Q4 being the highest benefit. As a reminder, we see our SSG&A and R&D costs relatively evenly spread through the year.  As expected, our tax rate in Q1 benefited from the timing of discrete items. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, that would imply we expect our average tax rate for the balance of the year to be about 13.7%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters.  Regarding COVID-only testing sales, we expect the vast majority of testing revenues to occur in fiscal Q2 and then trend down as Omicron subsides. In future years, we would not expect this level of COVID-only testing to repeat.  In summary, we are continuing to advance our BD2025 strategic objectives with focused execution against our key priorities. As we look forward, and as reflected in our FY '22 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement.  Thanks for your time. Operator, we can now open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe my first question, some clarification on the Q1 numbers here. Can you quantify what the contribution from combo test. There's some confusion on whether it was an abnormal contribution. I think in the past you've said it's about $75 million to $100 million. So was it in line with expectations? Has anything changed on combo test? And this licensing fee, it looks like maybe it was $40 million or $50 million contribution from a dollar perspective. Is that the right way to think about it?\nThomas Polen: Vijay, this is Tom. Thanks for the good question. So on flu COVID combo, testing is very much in line with our expectations. The -- as you said, it was $70 million to $80 million or so is what we expected for the full year, and you would expect a portion of that to be in Q1, and it played out as such. Essentially, it's relatively immaterial to overall BD, as you can imagine, if you take the 75 80 and you spread it over a couple of quarters. So that's what was in our numbers. We have not seen any -- it's a normal to light flu season this year. It's certainly higher than it was last year when there was essentially no flu. But if you look at the CDC data, it is on track for a light to normal flu season. but nothing above our expectations at this point in time.  I'll turn it over to Chris for the other question.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. And just to confirm, on the licensing revenue, yes, so it was worth 40 basis points. You can do the math. It's roughly $50 million. We also had -- you heard me reference, we're actively driving our ReCoDe initiative and SKU productivity and have been very intentional about making choices there to enhance our profitability. Given the strong growth profile, this affords us the luxury of being able to absorb some headwinds as we simplify our portfolio. And primarily in the BDI business, there was some impact there as well, and that actually had a negative impact in the quarter of about 30 basis points.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Chris. And maybe my follow-up on the guidance here. You guys [indiscernible] Q1 by about $250 million on the revenues versus street models, $0.60 on EPS. The guide raise was of a similar magnitude. When I look at your gross margin execution, ex licensing, it's well over 55%. It feels like perhaps the guidance is conservative, maybe talk about the assumptions that went into the 2Q to 4Q implied guide?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes, thanks for the question. Let me approach this 2 ways. So let me first talk about the quarter and how we delivered in the quarter maybe relative to what folks are seeing from kind of an external expectation standpoint. So obviously, we're very pleased with our Q1 results, clearly reflected strong base revenue growth which exceeded our expectations. As you noted, there was also a strong execution against our margin enhancement objectives, actually realizing benefit earlier in some areas, which will help us going forward because certainly we're seeing continued market-driven supply and inflation pressure as you look out into the back end of the year. Finally, we -- as you noted, we did realize incremental revenue from COVID-only testing. You can see that in our results. That actually had a strong margin as well in the first quarter.  The good thing here is the strength is nicely balanced between our base and the increment from testing. There were a couple of timing items as we think comparing to, again, kind of more what I would frame as external expectations. First, we had signaled there was -- we had expected a discrete tax item in Q1, which did play out as expected. So we had a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. We're still confident in our full year expected tax rate. So thus, you would expect a slight increase over our full year average through the balance to go there.  You had highlighted the licensing impact, which I don't think was contemplated in the external view. That was planned on our side.  Those 2 items alone explain what I would call the delta you're seeing between our total results relative to the external view.  I think the other 2 new considerations to think about that don't really show up in the quarter, one is we talked about reinvestment of the testing upside, which will obviously happen through the course of the year as we find those value-creating opportunities. And then we talked about the negative FX, which was worth about $0.10, which, again, that will also play out through the back of the year.  So actually, when you think of that, that implies that we actually have a stronger balance to go on the back end to account for absorbing those items.  So similar to what you said, bigger picture, I think the simple way to think of this is we increased sales by $250 million. That included a base increase of $150 million, testing of $250 million to $400 million. We did offset currency headwinds of $150 million. So that nets to the $250 million.  I think also importantly, if you take our Q1 actual results against our new base guide and look at our implied guide for Q2 to Q4, it's actually in line with our previous guide, which means we did not take our revenue projections down in the future.  And I think everyone is acknowledging there's actually more uncertainty given Omicron. We mentioned how we exited December heading into January. So that's actually signaling strength in how we feel about the back half.  And then our EPS, we increased $0.50, absorbing $0.10 of currency. And if you do the drop-through on EPS to sales, it's an extremely high conversion of sales to earnings, implying strong margin on that, fully leveraging our base and gives us confidence actually that we're on track to deliver our margin commitment.  So I think in light of all that, we see this as actually especially strong in light of continued market uncertainty and is reflective of our strong base business growth and our focus on execution.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Yes. And congrats on a good quarter. Chris, maybe I could just follow up on that a little bit and get a little more from you. You raised EPS by less than the beat. Should we think of that as any changes to the inflationary environment? Or maybe what went into the view to not raise it as much? Was the licensing, did it come earlier than expected? Or just anything we can get and help us phase through the rest of the year versus where we were before.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Robbie, for the question. I guess I'll reiterate some of the things that I just shared. To your point, extremely strong quarter. You saw the results relative to external expectations. There were 2 timing items. We had signaled tax in Q1, that was not contemplated in the external view. The licensing also wasn't contemplated in that external view. Those were both items that we had planned and we had communicated the tax. So when you think of those 2 items alone, we're actually giving more than, call it, an adjusted external view.  And then I think the last piece that isn't being considered is, there are new items in the back half of the year. Again, FX, right, which is going to play out, there's $0.10 there that will play out post Q1. And in addition to that, we had highlighted the fact that we are going to do some reinvestment on some of the margin drop-through on the incremental testing that happened in Q1.  So that kind of explains it. Again, I think the easiest way to think about it is, we delivered 8.3% growth in Q1. Our revenue guide has us holding the 8.3% and then actually holding the same guide on the balance to go, which means we're equally confident in our original guide despite the fact that everyone would acknowledge that there are more headwinds as it relates to Omicron, et cetera. It also implies at $0.50 on $250 million of sales an extremely strong drop-through to profit, right? It's highly variable. It's actually at a GP level or plus, which means all that revenue, we're fully leveraging our base and it only implies a strengthening perspective on our margin outlook.  And again, we're extremely excited about the start of the year. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we did talk about -- we do see continued inflation pressures as the year progresses. We're working really hard. The team is doing an outstanding job mitigating those. But it is certainly a unique environment. But I think a great start to the year. The guide increase signals more confidence than when we entered the year despite what I would argue is actually more complexity.\nThomas Polen: And Robbie, this is Tom. I think you've heard me used the word prudent pretty nonstop since the COVID pandemic hit. And so I would view our guide today is prudent with -- as the market continues to remain more stable, that there's opportunity for upside as we move through the year.\nRobert Marcus: That's actually very helpful. So it sounds like there's an extra $0.20 or so of reinvestment going back into the business. How should we think about where that's going and when and where we might see that materialize?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes. Obviously, so one, as the CFO, of course, it's going to be contingent on there'll be strong value-creating opportunities. We've always looked to innovation, I think, first. I think also anything that we can do to accelerate the great programs that we have in place to build capability and execute against our Simplify agenda, which will lead to margin, I think, would be the 2 areas that we would continue to prioritize.  I would likely see that kind of phase more second half. Certainly, with the new guide in our plan, some of that will happen in Q2, but it will probably be more kind of spread throughout the year is the way to think about that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.\nMatthew Mishan: Just first, could you go a little bit deeper on the Peripheral Intervention issues around the recall and supplier constraints and how long that's expected to last? And is there any way to quantify the magnitude? And was that originally contemplated in the guidance as well?\nThomas Polen: Matthew, this is Tom. I'll turn that over to Simon.\nSimon Campion: Matthew, Simon. Yes, I'd be happy to provide that information, but before I do so, I think it's fair to say we're reasonably happy with the performance of BDI in the quarter. And with respect to PI, we're happy with the position of that portfolio. We're happy with our competitiveness. We're happy with our ability to continue to strengthen that portfolio as you've seen the acquisition of Venclose during the quarter.  So the issues we face are -- I would classify them as extremely acute in nature and I feel time-bound. Three issues generally have been the source of the majority of the problem today. But this time last year, we recalled the Venovo venous stent and so we've got a headwind for 4 quarters at this point in time.  We expect 2 things from that. Number one, it's almost annualized. And number two, we do expect it to be back in the market in the second half of this financial year. And just to reiterate, that is not an implant issue. In fact, in September of last year, we published 3-year data from the [indiscernible] study on Venovo, which showed 84% [indiscernible] and 0 fractures and 0 migration. So we are very confident that this is going to have an impact on the market again.  Second issue was the backorder and supplier challenges in the NPI. PI does have the most complex portfolio, the most complex products and the most complex supply chain certainly within BDI. And we've experienced headwinds from raw material capacity to COVID impact in supplier sites to sterilization capacity in the past number of quarters. We do see light at the end of the tunnel on a number of those issues, particularly in relation to sterilization. And we expect to begin to see material improvements in our performance with respect to back order by the end of this quarter.  And then finally, as Chris and Tom have remarked, SKU rationalization has impacted PI more so than any other business this past quarter. And as we discussed in other fora, these product discontinuations are being done strategically with a view to enhancing margins and increasing efficiencies across our entire cycle from manufacturing to sales rep time allocation.\nThomas Polen: I think just to add, Simon, those strategic product exits that we've been doing in PI, but also in other areas of the company as part of our ReCoDe initiative, across the board, those -- with the strength of our revenue, we've been in a position to accelerate that strategy in a number of ways. And those products that we're discontinuing typically always have growth rates that are far below the company average and margins that are far below the company average. And so it's addition by subtraction as we think about that long term, as we simplify our portfolio and focus in those higher-growth spaces that are going to be driving the future of the company. So thank you, Matthew, for the question.\nMatthew Mishan: Okay. And just lastly on Alaris. And I'm sorry if I missed it in the prepared remarks. I know it wasn't previously assumed in guidance, but it says that FDA clearance of Alaris is not expected now in FY '22. Did something change in the conversations with the FDA?\nThomas Polen: No, Matthew. That's very -- that's exactly what we said when we gave guidance. That's no change at all. We continue to be focused on advancing Alaris and there's no updates.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congrats on the nice start to the fiscal year. I'll ask both my questions upfront. I heard pricing a lot so far on this call. Where do you guys see opportunity to take price? And what's embedded in the guidance for net price change year-over-year? And second, Chris, the guidance for the base business implies second half growth is below the range, I believe, based on your quarterly phasing, by our math, maybe 4%. Is that conservatism? And what does it imply about your ability to grow 5%, 5.5% plus beyond fiscal 2022?\nThomas Polen: Okay. Thank you for the question, Larry. Why don't we start with the last question first. I'll turn it to Chris on the growth pretty clear answer.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes, Larry, thanks for the question. Yes, the full balance to go is actually equal to our guide. What we did signal though was Q2, we're still navigating through kind of a recovery period, if you remember the resurgence last year. So it's really more I would think of it as kind of outsized on the BDI side of the business, in particular.  There are a couple of small comp dynamics in Q4 as well, right? We had some new product launches. So if you look at the comp from last year, it's very strong. So it's really just more comp dynamics, I think, as it relates to 5 5 plus for the long term, that this more than validates that we're well on track and strong there. As a matter of fact, our continuing to look at growth versus '19 as an example, too, is extremely strong, actually moving to over 5% with -- and that's -- and considering the fact that you have a year of COVID in there, that's a strong signal for the trajectory of the business.\nThomas Polen: And on pricing, Larry, so as you know, as you know BD very, very well, we've been focused on pricing for many years and had begun the journey with putting in resources in every business that are dedicated to pricing, pricing leadership at the company level as well. And obviously, in an environment where there's record levels of inflation, it's been an area that has been ever more important.  And so we began our journey of working on pricing in an inflationary environment last year and began taking actions. And you're starting to see and will continue to see the impacts of that flow through in the year. We take those actions very serious in discussions with our customers. We understand they work in a reimbursement-constrained environment. And so if you look at where we are implementing price most significantly, it is -- and we're very transparent with our customers, by the way, on where we're raising price and why we're raising price and the impacts of inflation as the driver of that. But where you see it most is in those products that we're selling for a dime, a quarter or low dollars, where BD over decades has invested billions of dollars of capital in creating extremely efficient, fully automated manufacturing facilities that allow us to be one of the only companies on the planet who can sell billions of devices at dimes and quarters and dollars.  And because of the way that we've just continued to refine our manufacturing capabilities over the year in a best-in-class ways, any increases in variable costs like resins, as an example, or chips, et cetera, they tend to flow right through and directly impact product margins and profitability. And so we can share what those impacts are on those raw material increases with our customers, and we have those discussions, and we've been raising price actively, particularly in those product categories.  And so while we're not giving out -- not sharing a specific number on price through the year, we are -- have been very, very active on that. And it's -- we're doing it in every region around the world, it's not a U.S. or Europe thing, it's equal across all geographies and directly related to passing through a portion of the inflationary impacts that we're getting on raw materials.  Of course, at the same time, we're taking a number of actions beyond pricing, passing it all through to our customers, and that includes us taking cost actions within the company, continuing to drive significant continuous improvement in our manufacturing plants and always look at ways to be more efficient and look at prices, that last resort. But we have certainly been doing more price this year than we have seen historically.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Larry, just one other quick thing. I don't know if this helps, I wasn't sure if your comment was operational. But obviously, the FX phasing will be certainly more back-end loaded in terms of the negative currency impact, maybe another consideration.  And then further to just Tom's comment on pricing from a progress standpoint, I think what I can share, we did not split out the dynamic, but it's part of our plan as it relates to -- we talked about an inflation impact and then cost improvement programs and price. Cost improvement is actually a large portion of it, to Tom's point, where we're getting a net 50 basis points improvement for the full year of the 200 basis points. The other 150 is coming from volume and strong growth and some FX benefit that carried over from last year.  And on pricing, we entered the year with plans, with 80%, 90% of firm plans in place and 50% of that action. We now have 100% plans fully identified and 7% of it is already fully executed, with the balance really more timing tied to triggers and other events. So really good progress there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatthew Taylor: I just had a follow-up on the thread on all the supply chain inflation issues and your ability to mitigate them. So wanted to understand better the forecast and what you're assuming for the second half of the year in terms of some of those headwinds abating. And Tom, I appreciate your comments on the nickel, dime and quarters, the lower-cost products. I was wondering specifically if you could also raise price on reagents or anywhere else in the portfolio?\nThomas Polen: Thank you for the question, Matt. So on the supply chain and inflation perspective, we don't have -- there's not assumptions that there's any major material reversal of the cost. There are some areas where we expect continued trending. Resins, for example, have been heading in a moderately to minorly favorable direction, as an example. We expect that to continue. But overall, we don't see major abatements in areas like shipping, as an example, or chips. That's -- we bake that into our outlook as we go forward. We do think those supply chain dynamics will continue certainly longer than most of the world thought at this time last year, and we see them -- many of them continuing through '22. So we have that built into our considerations and outlook.  The other question was.\nMatthew Taylor: Just on reagents or any other areas...\nThomas Polen: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Certainly, we do look at those, and we have raised price in a number of areas as appropriate across the portfolio. There are a few products, of course, in today's environment that aren't impacted by inflation in areas such as shipping or computer chips, et cetera. Instrumentation will be a good example of electromechanical inflation that we see and we raised costs there in areas such as service, where spare parts, certainly, the cost of those go up. And we do share the increases of those as well.  So the answer is yes. But by far and away, the most significant increases would be on those products that we are just extremely efficient at producing and where the percentage of COGS made up of raw materials are disproportionately high.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Just one small add that may help you think about how this sort of could play out through the year. Inflationary impacts kind of started more in the second half of last year, right? So as you go through this year, what you're going to see in the first half is kind of a full impact of continued inflation. As you get to the back half, you'll see some stabilization to some continuous increases, but to a smaller degree. And then think of the opposite as it relates to kind of the offsets that will drive, call it, the net, right? That will ramp a little bit slower, although we were -- we actually exceeded our expectations for Q1, but you have just sort of the natural ramp that happens as you put actions into place throughout the year. So that may help you as you sort of think of the timing dynamics.  We did talk about GP or GP operating margin, Q2 kind of being the low watermark as it relates to the full impact of inflation flowing through. And that is GP and up margin because a lot of the inflation is also in the area of shipping. So you should think of both line items in that regard.\nThomas Polen: And Matt, just maybe one other item to add is we have been very active and we put this in place last year. We have a formal inflation task force that we've established, with multiple different pillars within that and dedicated groups, working on everything from rethinking our logistics chain, and that includes looking at alternative shipping partners in a number of areas. For example, how can you ship from Asia to the U.S. or from Europe, U.S. to Europe in more efficient ways? What parts of our supply chain have traditionally used airfreight, as an example, that we can move on to rail or boats? We've been taking actions and rethinking that, both how we get products to customers, but also from raw material suppliers into our plants. And of course, looking at the materials themselves, where there's alternative vendors and working with existing vendors on different technologies that could be more cost effective for us to use. All of those are different components within our inflation task force, it's been very active, and we're seeing the impacts of that as well.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: Tom, Chris. Tom, just this excellent quarter, just the superb margin performance, et cetera, makes me think back actually to our December -- mid-December 2019 meeting as you were about to step into the CEO role. And I'm curious about 2 aspects of your comments back then. One, you highlighted your growth-focused priorities, particularly inorganically. I'd be curious to hear just maybe update -- your updated thinking on M&A and opportunities for the rest of the year, how aggressive you hope to be or what the opportunities are.  But the second part, and even more particularly, today, we've heard again and again about the clear path to that 400 basis of operating margin improvement. I was hoping you could be a little more granular about the 3 things you highlighted back in December 2019. You said we're going to reduce the manufacturing footprint. You're going to unify the end-to-end operational processes. And we've heard Chris highlighted the SKU rationalization reduction. Where are we on those initiatives? How much more is there to go? Sorry for the long question. Appreciate any color.\nThomas Polen: Thank you, Rick, for the question. And hopefully, get to see you again soon in person. As the pandemic here, it's been a while since we were able to connect live, which I always enjoy.  So I appreciate it. It's a great, great question. Certainly, as we look back and we laid out the BD2025 strategy, I do see that we're beginning to transition from how we view the first phase of that strategy into the second.  The first phase of that strategy, and I remember our discussion well, we talked about an initial focus on, including strengthening our balance sheet and cash flows to increase flexibility. And you've seen really pleased with the team's work around accounts receivable, payables, inventory. You've seen our free cash flow conversion moved up meaningfully. over that period of time. And that's allowed us to have flexibility to do what you just mentioned, M&A opportunities. And I think we are among, if not the highest, number of acquisitions within med tech this -- over the past 2 years. We clearly demonstrated our interest there.  We've also spent a lot of time accelerating innovation and reshaping our portfolio and driving strong execution in that portfolio. If you recall very early on, we jump-started that with the Growth and Innovation Fund. We gave that strategy a further boost by reinvesting a portion of the COVID testing proceeds last year. And we're beginning to see the results of that work. And the energy across the organization as our mindset is very strongly pivoted to growth.  And I am pleased with the cadence of the company M&A and how we've built those capabilities as a new lever for the organization. Obviously, just this quarter and the first few weeks of Q2, we've done 4 acquisitions. This year, I believe we did 6 or 7. Last year up to 17, over the last 2 years since we've met. And we are going to continue that focus.  We shared at our Analyst Day that 80% of our M&A has been focused in transformative solutions. The 3 areas that we've described repeatedly, smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving outcomes in chronic disease, focused within higher-growth sectors within those markets. Expect our tuck-in M&A strategy to continue to be focused within those while selectively doing deals that help secure and strengthen our position within our durable core, which is also doing very well as evidenced through our performance this quarter.  On the -- as we think about M&A opportunities, we certainly have -- continue to have a strong pipeline going forward. We've made commentary, we continue to not have any transformational M&A within scope of our strategy at this time. We're focused on tuck-in M&A. We do have the ability to go larger than what we've been doing, more in the up to $2 billion. And we can -- we will flex over $2 billion for the right strategic opportunities and value-creating opportunities. And so we'll continue to evolve the size of those as we go forward.  On the -- as we think about -- and maybe one last thing there, too, when we talk about M&A items coming in, of course, a major milestone here this week with the Board approving the spin of embecta, and that's part of our portfolio strategy as we now have dedicated Diabetes Care business. We will be one of the largest dedicated diabetes companies on the planet, able to have a focused management team, with focused cash flows, driving a focused strategy in that space to create shareholder value, while we focus in the other remaining areas for BD. Focus our talent, our resources, our capabilities in those areas that are most strategic to us. And I think it's a value-creating opportunity very clearly for what will be now 2 stand-alone companies. But a major milestone. And interestingly, a milestone that was achieved, nearly to the day, 100 years. It was January of 1922, end of January 1922, when the first insulin was injected. It was used in therapy on a teenager up in Canada. And it's interesting nearly 100 years later is when we just are spinning out the world's largest insulin injection company now as a stand-alone organization.  So on the Simplify side, we're really pleased with the progress there. And you could hear from whether or not the actions that we've been taking and how we've been exiting certain product lines, that thousands of SKUs that we're getting rid of as we simplify our portfolio to focus on those products that matter and we're going to drive our growth and help simplify our plans. We have dedicated teams working on our network simplification strategy. Those have all been identified and are underway around our manufacturing footprint.  And while SKU rationalization, you've heard it's well underway. We'll continue to execute that. Largely over the next year, that will be completed as that.  At the same time, you can see very clearly, we are hyper focused on our margin strategy. ReCoDe is part of that, but it also includes areas around the supply chain and inflation management that I talked about, includes pricing as part of that as well.  We made a commitment during our Analyst Day around the 400 basis points of improvements in getting back to pre-'19 margin levels by 2024, and we've got that in our sights and are hyper-focused on delivering to that goal.  So we're very pleased with the progress we're making. As we look ahead, we're going to continue to focus on executing that strategy that we outlined as part of BD2025 and shared more details on at our Analyst Day, and we look forward to continue to update you on the progress.\nOperator: And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Tom Polen for any closing remarks.\nThomas Polen: Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. Before we sign off, I just want to thank BD's 75,000 associates around the globe who live our purpose every day to advance the world of health, who are working tirelessly to support our customers and frontline health care workers around the world and are committed to executing our strategy. I'm proud of how we've started fiscal '22. I'm looking forward to continuing to deliver on our goals and making meaningful impacts for our customers and their patients around the world. On behalf of the entire executive team, thank you for your efforts and sacrifices.  And operator, with that, we will end today's call.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's audio webcast. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca. Welcome aboard. We're very happy to have you on the team. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q1. It reflects the continued execution of our BD2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business. We made meaningful progress and delivered on our revenue, margin, earnings and cash flow goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy. Our performance, along with the progress we are making delivering across our key priorities, gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance for both our base business and COVID testing.  We were able to deliver these results in an uncertain market environment, demonstrating demand across our broad portfolio of products essential to patient care, along with BD's unique ability to deliver strong performance in the face of an ongoing global pandemic. The market impacts from COVID-19 dynamics continue to be in focus, particularly in the health care sector. However, we've witnessed a global health care system that's more agile and better prepared as each new variant has emerged.  In Q1, health care utilization levels continued at rates similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, remaining slightly below pre-pandemic levels until mid-December, then only declining modestly as a result of Omicron.  While we saw some slowdowns in deferrable procedures in the back half of December in certain regions due to hospital-imposed restrictions and staffing constraints, overall, our customers were able to continue to provide care to support patients and sustain a solid base of deferrable procedures. These challenges to procedure levels had minimal impact on our business in the first quarter. In addition, we saw routine lab testing returned to normal levels in Q1 and research lab activity remains strong.  With that said, as we look ahead, there are some pressures today related to staffing constraints that are impacting the delivery of some deferrable procedures, coupled with supply chain dynamics. We continue to watch these market dynamics closely.  Despite the continued recovery, uncertainty and inflationary pressures, I'm pleased with our team's focus on execution. Our segments are delivering strong profitable growth and our strategic initiatives to enhance margins are progressing well. As seen in our results, we're off to a strong start, being very active and intentional in executing our inflation-mitigation initiatives across procurement, shipping and continuous improvements in our plants as well as appropriate pricing-related actions.  Further, we intend to be best-in-class in navigating the current inflationary environment. We see signs of continued pressure on shipping, labor, raw materials and electronic components over the remainder of the year since our last guidance update. However, we believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery, and we expect to offset any inflationary impacts through various cost-containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1 that will enable us to deliver on our full year objectives.  I'll now give a high-level summary of our financial performance. Q1 revenues of $5 billion reflect continued strong momentum in our base business. And through our focused execution, we grew base business revenues 8.3% in the first quarter. We also saw increased demand for our professional and at-home COVID tests relative to our previously communicated guidance, which was fueled by the Omicron variant.  As expected, in comparison to the prior year, COVID-only testing revenues declined, driven by lower antigen test pricing and volumes and a number of new entrants to the market with over 40 EUAs now granted in the U.S.  We have also continued to execute our cash flow initiatives, and we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $700 million. Our strong cash flow continues to enable investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, which are fueling our BD2025 strategy.  In Q1, we closed 3 acquisitions, Scanwell, Tissuemed and Venclose. And just this week, we announced the acquisition of Cytognos, whose differentiated flow cytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer, bring an important addition to our biosciences business. These acquisitions advance our strategy to expand in higher-growth spaces that complement our durable portfolio and bring new transformative solutions across smart connected care, new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes.  Our disciplined capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to deploy capital towards value-creating opportunities in both R&D and M&A for future growth as well as return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate.  As we look across the balance of FY '22, our Q1 momentum and focus on execution are driving our strong FY '22 outlook. As we have communicated, we see our growth profile as derisked as we're leaders in areas of health care that remain in high demand and are driving base revenues. We have strengthened our growth profile through new product launches and acquired assets in the higher-growth spaces that are adding to our performance. And we continue to support increased testing demand. While we expect the recent demand surge to be temporary, in the event that COVID-19 cases persist longer than anticipated, our testing portfolio provides a natural hedge against deferrable procedure softness and other COVID-related headwinds.  In addition to our derisked growth profile, we're also confident in our ability to improve our gross margins given the strong progress we've made to date through focused execution against our detailed plans to offset inflationary pressures and deliver cost improvements. All of this gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance while remaining appropriately prudent given the current uncertain environment.  So turning to innovation. We remain focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. During the quarter, we progressed our innovation pipeline, launching several new products. Examples include BD COR, where we recently launched our molecular MX module, which fully completes the CE Mark system. The MX is built off of our BD MAX assay technology, which will allow us to leverage the BD MAX menu of infectious disease tests into the high throughput lab segment.  We also launched BD Kiestra IdentifA, which received the 510(k) clearance this quarter and is designed to fully automate and integrate the preparation of microbiology bacterial identification testing using smart connected robotics.  Beyond these achievements, we also hit several milestones across our pipeline. We submitted the 510(k) to the FDA for our TREK bone biopsy device. The TREK biopsy system will provide interventional radiologists with an easier and faster way to perform bone biopsies without the need to use multiple devices, thus reduces the cost per procedure, inventory needs and reduces procedure time.  Our Pyxis ES version 1.7 software is now live in limited commercial release at 4 sites in anticipation of full commercial launch. This software adds new capabilities like enhanced automation and controlled substance management via improved connectivity with our C2 Safe offering and enables deeper integration of pharmacy and nursing areas.  We're also very proud of our new BD FACS Discover S8 CellSorter, which is currently profiled as a cover story of the January issue of Science Magazine. The S8 is a landmark advancement in flow cytometry that has the potential to transform a wide range of disciplines from immunology and genomics research to cell-based therapeutics. For the first time, we can sort cells at high speeds while separating cells not only based on which antibodies or other markers we see, but also based on new imaging parameters. To put this leapfrog technology in perspective, the most advanced flow cytometers today can analyze and sort cells based on 3 non-fluorescent parameters and have processing speeds of up to 15 megabytes per second. The S8 analyze and sorts on 11 nonfluorescent parameters and has processing speeds of up to 2,000 megabytes per second. We encourage you to visit bdbiosciences.com/celvieu to learn more about this exciting new innovation.  I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy. To that end, I am pleased to report that our Board of Directors recently approved the spin-off of embecta, which is scheduled to occur on April 1. We remain on track for a successful embecta spin. We continue to believe the spin is a significant value-creating opportunity for our shareholders as both BD and embecta are well positioned for success.  embecta will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher revenue growth.  Further, we expect the spin-off will not have an impact on the long-term growth targets we laid out at Investor Day. And instead, we expect it to enhance both our sales and earnings growth profile and create an opportunity for additional shareholder value.  Finally, regarding our progress on advancing our ESG strategy, which serves as a framework through which we address the most relevant ESG issues for our company and our stakeholders. We continue to make strong progress against our goals. We launched our inaugural 2021 Global Inclusion Diversity and Equity report, in which we shared our ID&E foundation, strategy and actions towards the healthy workforce and communities pillar of our 2030 ESG goals. BD's commitment to ID&E sets a new standard for how the company will work together to innovate new products and solutions, and we firmly believe that the more diverse people and perspectives there are at the table, the better outcomes we can produce to deliver what's next in health care.  We also published our second Annual Cybersecurity Report to update stakeholders on the state of health care cybersecurity, BD's impacts on advancing cybersecurity maturity and anticipated trends for 2022. We're very proud to be the first and only med tech company to publish a cybersecurity report. Through our leadership position in health care cybersecurity in our annual report, we're working to address cybersecurity challenges specific to our industry.  We also continue to receive external recognition of our ESG efforts, including just recently being named one of America's Most Just Companies in the Annual JUST 100 Ranking and ranking in the top 3 within our industry.  I'm proud of the progress we're making advancing both our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. The actions we're taking are driving excellent momentum. We believe we are well positioned to deliver and create value for all of our stakeholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. Vijay, this is Tom. Thanks for the good question. So on flu COVID combo, testing is very much in line with our expectations. The -- as you said, it was $70 million to $80 million or so is what we expected for the full year, and you would expect a portion of that to be in Q1, and it played out as such. Essentially, it's relatively immaterial to overall BD, as you can imagine, if you take the 75 80 and you spread it over a couple of quarters. So that's what was in our numbers. We have not seen any -- it's a normal to light flu season this year. It's certainly higher than it was last year when there was essentially no flu. But if you look at the CDC data, it is on track for a light to normal flu season. but nothing above our expectations at this point in time.  I'll turn it over to Chris for the other question. And Robbie, this is Tom. I think you've heard me used the word prudent pretty nonstop since the COVID pandemic hit. And so I would view our guide today is prudent with -- as the market continues to remain more stable, that there's opportunity for upside as we move through the year. Matthew, this is Tom. I'll turn that over to Simon. I think just to add, Simon, those strategic product exits that we've been doing in PI, but also in other areas of the company as part of our ReCoDe initiative, across the board, those -- with the strength of our revenue, we've been in a position to accelerate that strategy in a number of ways. And those products that we're discontinuing typically always have growth rates that are far below the company average and margins that are far below the company average. And so it's addition by subtraction as we think about that long term, as we simplify our portfolio and focus in those higher-growth spaces that are going to be driving the future of the company. So thank you, Matthew, for the question. No, Matthew. That's very -- that's exactly what we said when we gave guidance. That's no change at all. We continue to be focused on advancing Alaris and there's no updates. Okay. Thank you for the question, Larry. Why don't we start with the last question first. I'll turn it to Chris on the growth pretty clear answer. And on pricing, Larry, so as you know, as you know BD very, very well, we've been focused on pricing for many years and had begun the journey with putting in resources in every business that are dedicated to pricing, pricing leadership at the company level as well. And obviously, in an environment where there's record levels of inflation, it's been an area that has been ever more important.  And so we began our journey of working on pricing in an inflationary environment last year and began taking actions. And you're starting to see and will continue to see the impacts of that flow through in the year. We take those actions very serious in discussions with our customers. We understand they work in a reimbursement-constrained environment. And so if you look at where we are implementing price most significantly, it is -- and we're very transparent with our customers, by the way, on where we're raising price and why we're raising price and the impacts of inflation as the driver of that. But where you see it most is in those products that we're selling for a dime, a quarter or low dollars, where BD over decades has invested billions of dollars of capital in creating extremely efficient, fully automated manufacturing facilities that allow us to be one of the only companies on the planet who can sell billions of devices at dimes and quarters and dollars.  And because of the way that we've just continued to refine our manufacturing capabilities over the year in a best-in-class ways, any increases in variable costs like resins, as an example, or chips, et cetera, they tend to flow right through and directly impact product margins and profitability. And so we can share what those impacts are on those raw material increases with our customers, and we have those discussions, and we've been raising price actively, particularly in those product categories.  And so while we're not giving out -- not sharing a specific number on price through the year, we are -- have been very, very active on that. And it's -- we're doing it in every region around the world, it's not a U.S. or Europe thing, it's equal across all geographies and directly related to passing through a portion of the inflationary impacts that we're getting on raw materials.  Of course, at the same time, we're taking a number of actions beyond pricing, passing it all through to our customers, and that includes us taking cost actions within the company, continuing to drive significant continuous improvement in our manufacturing plants and always look at ways to be more efficient and look at prices, that last resort. But we have certainly been doing more price this year than we have seen historically. Thank you for the question, Matt. So on the supply chain and inflation perspective, we don't have -- there's not assumptions that there's any major material reversal of the cost. There are some areas where we expect continued trending. Resins, for example, have been heading in a moderately to minorly favorable direction, as an example. We expect that to continue. But overall, we don't see major abatements in areas like shipping, as an example, or chips. That's -- we bake that into our outlook as we go forward. We do think those supply chain dynamics will continue certainly longer than most of the world thought at this time last year, and we see them -- many of them continuing through '22. So we have that built into our considerations and outlook.  The other question was. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Certainly, we do look at those, and we have raised price in a number of areas as appropriate across the portfolio. There are a few products, of course, in today's environment that aren't impacted by inflation in areas such as shipping or computer chips, et cetera. Instrumentation will be a good example of electromechanical inflation that we see and we raised costs there in areas such as service, where spare parts, certainly, the cost of those go up. And we do share the increases of those as well.  So the answer is yes. But by far and away, the most significant increases would be on those products that we are just extremely efficient at producing and where the percentage of COGS made up of raw materials are disproportionately high. And Matt, just maybe one other item to add is we have been very active and we put this in place last year. We have a formal inflation task force that we've established, with multiple different pillars within that and dedicated groups, working on everything from rethinking our logistics chain, and that includes looking at alternative shipping partners in a number of areas. For example, how can you ship from Asia to the U.S. or from Europe, U.S. to Europe in more efficient ways? What parts of our supply chain have traditionally used airfreight, as an example, that we can move on to rail or boats? We've been taking actions and rethinking that, both how we get products to customers, but also from raw material suppliers into our plants. And of course, looking at the materials themselves, where there's alternative vendors and working with existing vendors on different technologies that could be more cost effective for us to use. All of those are different components within our inflation task force, it's been very active, and we're seeing the impacts of that as well. Thank you, Rick, for the question. And hopefully, get to see you again soon in person. As the pandemic here, it's been a while since we were able to connect live, which I always enjoy.  So I appreciate it. It's a great, great question. Certainly, as we look back and we laid out the BD2025 strategy, I do see that we're beginning to transition from how we view the first phase of that strategy into the second.  The first phase of that strategy, and I remember our discussion well, we talked about an initial focus on, including strengthening our balance sheet and cash flows to increase flexibility. And you've seen really pleased with the team's work around accounts receivable, payables, inventory. You've seen our free cash flow conversion moved up meaningfully. over that period of time. And that's allowed us to have flexibility to do what you just mentioned, M&A opportunities. And I think we are among, if not the highest, number of acquisitions within med tech this -- over the past 2 years. We clearly demonstrated our interest there.  We've also spent a lot of time accelerating innovation and reshaping our portfolio and driving strong execution in that portfolio. If you recall very early on, we jump-started that with the Growth and Innovation Fund. We gave that strategy a further boost by reinvesting a portion of the COVID testing proceeds last year. And we're beginning to see the results of that work. And the energy across the organization as our mindset is very strongly pivoted to growth.  And I am pleased with the cadence of the company M&A and how we've built those capabilities as a new lever for the organization. Obviously, just this quarter and the first few weeks of Q2, we've done 4 acquisitions. This year, I believe we did 6 or 7. Last year up to 17, over the last 2 years since we've met. And we are going to continue that focus.  We shared at our Analyst Day that 80% of our M&A has been focused in transformative solutions. The 3 areas that we've described repeatedly, smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving outcomes in chronic disease, focused within higher-growth sectors within those markets. Expect our tuck-in M&A strategy to continue to be focused within those while selectively doing deals that help secure and strengthen our position within our durable core, which is also doing very well as evidenced through our performance this quarter.  On the -- as we think about M&A opportunities, we certainly have -- continue to have a strong pipeline going forward. We've made commentary, we continue to not have any transformational M&A within scope of our strategy at this time. We're focused on tuck-in M&A. We do have the ability to go larger than what we've been doing, more in the up to $2 billion. And we can -- we will flex over $2 billion for the right strategic opportunities and value-creating opportunities. And so we'll continue to evolve the size of those as we go forward.  On the -- as we think about -- and maybe one last thing there, too, when we talk about M&A items coming in, of course, a major milestone here this week with the Board approving the spin of embecta, and that's part of our portfolio strategy as we now have dedicated Diabetes Care business. We will be one of the largest dedicated diabetes companies on the planet, able to have a focused management team, with focused cash flows, driving a focused strategy in that space to create shareholder value, while we focus in the other remaining areas for BD. Focus our talent, our resources, our capabilities in those areas that are most strategic to us. And I think it's a value-creating opportunity very clearly for what will be now 2 stand-alone companies. But a major milestone. And interestingly, a milestone that was achieved, nearly to the day, 100 years. It was January of 1922, end of January 1922, when the first insulin was injected. It was used in therapy on a teenager up in Canada. And it's interesting nearly 100 years later is when we just are spinning out the world's largest insulin injection company now as a stand-alone organization.  So on the Simplify side, we're really pleased with the progress there. And you could hear from whether or not the actions that we've been taking and how we've been exiting certain product lines, that thousands of SKUs that we're getting rid of as we simplify our portfolio to focus on those products that matter and we're going to drive our growth and help simplify our plans. We have dedicated teams working on our network simplification strategy. Those have all been identified and are underway around our manufacturing footprint.  And while SKU rationalization, you've heard it's well underway. We'll continue to execute that. Largely over the next year, that will be completed as that.  At the same time, you can see very clearly, we are hyper focused on our margin strategy. ReCoDe is part of that, but it also includes areas around the supply chain and inflation management that I talked about, includes pricing as part of that as well.  We made a commitment during our Analyst Day around the 400 basis points of improvements in getting back to pre-'19 margin levels by 2024, and we've got that in our sights and are hyper-focused on delivering to that goal.  So we're very pleased with the progress we're making. As we look ahead, we're going to continue to focus on executing that strategy that we outlined as part of BD2025 and shared more details on at our Analyst Day, and we look forward to continue to update you on the progress. Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. Before we sign off, I just want to thank BD's 75,000 associates around the globe who live our purpose every day to advance the world of health, who are working tirelessly to support our customers and frontline health care workers around the world and are committed to executing our strategy. I'm proud of how we've started fiscal '22. I'm looking forward to continuing to deliver on our goals and making meaningful impacts for our customers and their patients around the world. On behalf of the entire executive team, thank you for your efforts and sacrifices.  And operator, with that, we will end today's call."

            "name": "Christopher DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q1 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. We are enhancing our growth profile through the portfolio and investment actions we are taking, while also executing on margin improvement and inflationary-mitigation programs to deliver our long-term margin expansion targets and double-digit earnings growth profile. To that end, I'd like to recognize our associates across supply chain for their contributions. We have an incredible team around the world that is not only addressing the challenges that all companies are facing in today's environment, but they are excelling and driving performance.  Turning to our revenue performance. We delivered $5 billion in revenue in the first quarter comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 8.3%, and 7.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. COVID-only testing revenues were $185 million, which, as expected, declined from $866 million last year, as this was our highest revenue quarter for COVID testing last year given higher pricing and volumes. The year-over-year decline in total company revenues of 5.9% is entirely attributable to the decline in testing revenues.  BD is uniquely positioned to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations, as demonstrated by the revenue performance across our segments, with BD Medical growing 6%, Life Sciences based revenues growing over 17% and Interventional growing 3.8%.  Total company base business growth was also strong regionally, with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America.  Let me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the first quarter, growing 6%, led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses.  MDS revenues increased 7.3%, reflecting strong demand for our durable core products, particularly in the U.S., driven by competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. Our leadership position in these markets allow us to provide a strong value proposition to our customers in terms of the breadth of our portfolio as well as the cost and quality of our products. Importantly, as input costs such as resins have increased, we've been able to take appropriate price actions and accelerate cost mitigation programs while continuing to invest in innovation to support our strong value proposition.  In MMS, revenues were down slightly due to the difficult prior-year comparison given the high number of infusion pump placements last year in the U.S. and Europe to support COVID-related hospital needs. Excluding this impact, our MMS business reflects continued execution of our medication management strategy, which drove strong demand worldwide for our dispensing solutions. This was particularly evident in the U.S., where we saw another strong quarter of customer signings. The traction we are getting reflects the value our Pyxis platform provides our customers.  Revenue growth of 1.6% in Diabetes Care reflects our category leadership position. Growth was aided by the timing of certain orders.  Pharm Systems revenue grew nearly 18%, driven by continued strong demand for pre-fillable devices. Growth was also enabled by our focused execution on capacity expansion that allowed us to fulfill certain orders earlier than originally anticipated. Demand for pre-filled devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs.  BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the first quarter. The decline of 24.8% year-over-year is solely due to lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.2%, with licensing revenue in IDS contributing about 400 basis points to the segment's base growth and about 100 basis points to the total company based revenue growth.  In IDS, base business revenues had strong growth of 20.3%, including about 600 basis points from licensing revenue. Performance was driven by our specimen management, microbiology and molecular platforms as routine lab testing returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Growth in BD MAX IVD assays was also strong, reflecting the leverage we are getting on the larger installed base. Performance in our base business includes sales of our combination flu COVID assay that were in line with our expectations. Indications are the respiratory season will be a normal to low flu season.  Biosciences revenues increased 9%, driven by strong demand for research solutions as a result of lab utilization returning to normal levels and continued research on COVID variants. Contributing to Life Sciences Q1 growth were the 2 new FACSSymphony instruments that we launched in FY '21. As the evolution of flow cytometry continues to move from large labs to more midsized independent labs, we now provide a complete suite of analyzers for researchers from the benchtop A1 to the A5 SE, our first spectral analyzer that enables researchers to do even high-parameter cellular analysis to gain broader insights into pioneering new discoveries and treatments for cancer and other immune-related conditions.  Our new e-commerce site also contributed to growth in Q1. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the first quarter, growing 3.8%. BDI's performance reflects strong growth in Surgery and UCC. Q1 performance was impacted by temporary supply chain disruptions, and consistent with our ReCoDe initiative, product line discontinuations of lower-margin products in our PI and UCC businesses. While these strategic discontinuations create a temporary headwind to revenue growth, it demonstrates our commitment to simplifying our portfolio and enhancing margins.  We had a strong start to the year in our Surgery business, with revenue growth of nearly 9% despite some modest slowdowns towards the end of December due to Omicron. Strength in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in advanced reconstruction and repair, with strength in hernia as deferrable procedures recovered, and the recent acquisition of Tepha.  Tepha provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform, but more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.  Double-digit growth in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in infection prevention was also driven by the recovery of deferrable procedures and continued market adoption of Sterile BD ChloraPrep.  Revenues in Peripheral Intervention declined 3.1% as a result of a product recall from fiscal '21 and the previously mentioned supply disruptions and product line discontinuations that support our margin enhancement goals. However, we saw continued acceleration in our atherectomy platform in China as we have leveraged the capabilities of our sales force. We are also experiencing positive momentum from our recent acquisition of Venclose.  Urology & Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for PureWick in our acute urology portfolio. We're also seeing continued adoption of our PureWick solutions in the home as we advance our strategy to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was remediation of Q4's temporary supply disruption within acute urology.  Now moving to our P&L. We delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations in Q1, with adjusted net income of $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.64. We had strong execution of our margin enhancement initiatives in Q1 and delivered base business gross margin of 55.4% and operating margin of 24.3%. We remain on track to deliver our full year base margin goals, with our base margin performance in Q1 ahead of our expectations for the quarter and also above our full year base margin expectations, due to our ability to realize some of our inflation mitigation and pricing initiatives sooner than we previously anticipated.  In addition, our Q1 base business operating margin also included a benefit of about 40 basis points from licensing revenues in Life Sciences that was included in our full year plan. Excluding the licensing revenue, base gross and operating margin would have been nearly 55% and 24%, respectively.  Other key drivers of gross margin in Q1 include a benefit from increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth and, as expected, favorable FX we experienced in 2021 but was recorded in inventory and benefited our GP this quarter when sold. We did realize a negative impact from inflation in the quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations and was partially offset by our cost improvement and inflation mitigation actions, which are occurring as planned. We are making very good progress with strong sequential improvement and our full year base gross margin improvement goal remains on track despite continued inflationary pressures.  SSG&A was in line with expectations and increased year-over-year, driven by variable expenses, including selling and commissions, and inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping, that we have previously shared. The increase in SSG&A as a percent of sales is a function of lower testing sales. However, we did leverage SSG&A versus our base revenue, which is contributing to our base operating margin improvement.  R&D increased year-over-year, consistent with our strategy to invest more to support our long-term growth outlook. As anticipated and communicated on our prior earnings call, our tax rate benefited from the timing of discrete items, resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.  Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $700 million in the first quarter. We ended Q1 with a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Our cash balance reflects our strategic investments in M&A during the quarter.  Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A.  During Q1, we invested in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline. We also invested over $400 million in 3 additional tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond.  Turning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, the macro considerations that support our guidance. While we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the stabilization of deferrable procedures and no significant disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Additionally, we see signs of continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year, with some stabilization by the end of the year. However, we believe we have a clear path to margin recovery, and we expect to offset any incremental inflation impact through various cost containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1. Our guidance doesn't contemplate a more significant step increase in market-driven supply chain and inflationary disruption.  A few comments on testing-specific assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays. We anticipate a normal to light flu season based on what we've seen so far from the CDC surveillance reports.  Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations and, thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance.  While we aren't providing segment-specific items, relative to our revised total company base growth outlook, we expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below and our Life Sciences and Interventional segment growth to be slightly above total company growth.  We now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75% on an FX-neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 5% to 6% growth and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and confidence in the strength and resilience of our base portfolio, and our Q1 acquisitions, which account for about 25 basis points of the increase.  For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming $450 million in revenue, which is a little more than double our original expectation of $200 million. As we communicated last quarter, higher testing revenues position us well to manage through this period of uncertainty and also provide the potential to create value through reinvestment in our business. Given our increased testing revenue expectations, we currently plan to reinvest a portion of the testing profits over the balance of the year, but we'll ensure they are value-creating opportunities and would not invest at a level that would result in our full year testing margins dropping below our base margins. Should those investment opportunities not materialize as anticipated, we would allow the incremental profits to flow through.  Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 125 basis points or about $250 million to total company revenues. This is an incremental 75 basis point headwind compared to our prior view.  All in with our base revenue, COVID-only testing revenue and the illustrative currency impact, we now expect reported revenues in the range of $19.55 billion to $19.75 billion in fiscal '22, compared to $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion previously announced.  We still expect operating margins in our base business to improve by approximately 200 basis points over our fiscal '21 base operating margin of 21.7%.  Given the planned reinvestment, we also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models. We now expect $50 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest other or an incremental $25 million benefit. We still expect an effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% for the full year. Our guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at a minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation.  All in, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.80 and $13, which is an increase of $0.50 at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $12.30 to $12.50. This includes absorbing the negative impact of currency, which we estimate to be about $0.10. The increase reflects our strong Q1 base business performance and our expectations for increased COVID testing net of reinvestment.  As a reminder, our fiscal '22 guidance continues to include our Diabetes business. As Tom mentioned, the embecta spin has now been approved by the Board of Directors. As we proceed towards the spin date, I want to provide a few reminders Restated financials for RemainCo will not be made public until the completion of the spinoff. Given the higher but declining margin profile of embecta, one should expect BD margins to be lower after they're restated. However, off the restated FY '21 financials, we are still targeting about 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through FY '25. BD is expected to receive a distribution of approximately $1.44 billion, equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We remain excited for what's ahead for embecta and making this a successful and value-creating opportunity for everyone.  As you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of our base revenue and earnings. Regarding sales, we remain confident in the durable nature of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying sales.  In Q2, we expect some impact from Omicron on hospital staffing and procedures. But recall, Q2 is a relatively easy compare due to the significant COVID resurgence we experienced in Q2 of fiscal '21. As a result, we anticipate base revenue growth in Q2 to be above our full year guidance range, with the remaining quarters being equally balanced.  Regarding our margins and P&L, as I noted, Q1 had the benefit from licensing, which added about 40 basis points to operating margin, which will not repeat in Q2. While we expect improvement versus the prior year, we also previously shared that Q2 would be the quarter with the largest inflationary impact.  So given those 2 dynamics, you would expect a sequential step down in margin, and we expect Q2 to represent the low watermark for base operating margin for the year.  We remain well on track to achieve our base operating margin guidance of approximately 200 basis points improvement. As we progress through the second half of the fiscal year, in Q3, we expect the impact of inflation on our business to stabilize and see a modest pickup of cost improvement and price-related benefits flowing through, with Q4 being the highest benefit. As a reminder, we see our SSG&A and R&D costs relatively evenly spread through the year.  As expected, our tax rate in Q1 benefited from the timing of discrete items. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, that would imply we expect our average tax rate for the balance of the year to be about 13.7%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters.  Regarding COVID-only testing sales, we expect the vast majority of testing revenues to occur in fiscal Q2 and then trend down as Omicron subsides. In future years, we would not expect this level of COVID-only testing to repeat.  In summary, we are continuing to advance our BD2025 strategic objectives with focused execution against our key priorities. As we look forward, and as reflected in our FY '22 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement.  Thanks for your time. Operator, we can now open the line for Q&A. Yes. And just to confirm, on the licensing revenue, yes, so it was worth 40 basis points. You can do the math. It's roughly $50 million. We also had -- you heard me reference, we're actively driving our ReCoDe initiative and SKU productivity and have been very intentional about making choices there to enhance our profitability. Given the strong growth profile, this affords us the luxury of being able to absorb some headwinds as we simplify our portfolio. And primarily in the BDI business, there was some impact there as well, and that actually had a negative impact in the quarter of about 30 basis points. Yes, thanks for the question. Let me approach this 2 ways. So let me first talk about the quarter and how we delivered in the quarter maybe relative to what folks are seeing from kind of an external expectation standpoint. So obviously, we're very pleased with our Q1 results, clearly reflected strong base revenue growth which exceeded our expectations. As you noted, there was also a strong execution against our margin enhancement objectives, actually realizing benefit earlier in some areas, which will help us going forward because certainly we're seeing continued market-driven supply and inflation pressure as you look out into the back end of the year. Finally, we -- as you noted, we did realize incremental revenue from COVID-only testing. You can see that in our results. That actually had a strong margin as well in the first quarter.  The good thing here is the strength is nicely balanced between our base and the increment from testing. There were a couple of timing items as we think comparing to, again, kind of more what I would frame as external expectations. First, we had signaled there was -- we had expected a discrete tax item in Q1, which did play out as expected. So we had a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. We're still confident in our full year expected tax rate. So thus, you would expect a slight increase over our full year average through the balance to go there.  You had highlighted the licensing impact, which I don't think was contemplated in the external view. That was planned on our side.  Those 2 items alone explain what I would call the delta you're seeing between our total results relative to the external view.  I think the other 2 new considerations to think about that don't really show up in the quarter, one is we talked about reinvestment of the testing upside, which will obviously happen through the course of the year as we find those value-creating opportunities. And then we talked about the negative FX, which was worth about $0.10, which, again, that will also play out through the back of the year.  So actually, when you think of that, that implies that we actually have a stronger balance to go on the back end to account for absorbing those items.  So similar to what you said, bigger picture, I think the simple way to think of this is we increased sales by $250 million. That included a base increase of $150 million, testing of $250 million to $400 million. We did offset currency headwinds of $150 million. So that nets to the $250 million.  I think also importantly, if you take our Q1 actual results against our new base guide and look at our implied guide for Q2 to Q4, it's actually in line with our previous guide, which means we did not take our revenue projections down in the future.  And I think everyone is acknowledging there's actually more uncertainty given Omicron. We mentioned how we exited December heading into January. So that's actually signaling strength in how we feel about the back half.  And then our EPS, we increased $0.50, absorbing $0.10 of currency. And if you do the drop-through on EPS to sales, it's an extremely high conversion of sales to earnings, implying strong margin on that, fully leveraging our base and gives us confidence actually that we're on track to deliver our margin commitment.  So I think in light of all that, we see this as actually especially strong in light of continued market uncertainty and is reflective of our strong base business growth and our focus on execution. Yes. Thanks, Robbie, for the question. I guess I'll reiterate some of the things that I just shared. To your point, extremely strong quarter. You saw the results relative to external expectations. There were 2 timing items. We had signaled tax in Q1, that was not contemplated in the external view. The licensing also wasn't contemplated in that external view. Those were both items that we had planned and we had communicated the tax. So when you think of those 2 items alone, we're actually giving more than, call it, an adjusted external view.  And then I think the last piece that isn't being considered is, there are new items in the back half of the year. Again, FX, right, which is going to play out, there's $0.10 there that will play out post Q1. And in addition to that, we had highlighted the fact that we are going to do some reinvestment on some of the margin drop-through on the incremental testing that happened in Q1.  So that kind of explains it. Again, I think the easiest way to think about it is, we delivered 8.3% growth in Q1. Our revenue guide has us holding the 8.3% and then actually holding the same guide on the balance to go, which means we're equally confident in our original guide despite the fact that everyone would acknowledge that there are more headwinds as it relates to Omicron, et cetera. It also implies at $0.50 on $250 million of sales an extremely strong drop-through to profit, right? It's highly variable. It's actually at a GP level or plus, which means all that revenue, we're fully leveraging our base and it only implies a strengthening perspective on our margin outlook.  And again, we're extremely excited about the start of the year. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we did talk about -- we do see continued inflation pressures as the year progresses. We're working really hard. The team is doing an outstanding job mitigating those. But it is certainly a unique environment. But I think a great start to the year. The guide increase signals more confidence than when we entered the year despite what I would argue is actually more complexity. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes. Obviously, so one, as the CFO, of course, it's going to be contingent on there'll be strong value-creating opportunities. We've always looked to innovation, I think, first. I think also anything that we can do to accelerate the great programs that we have in place to build capability and execute against our Simplify agenda, which will lead to margin, I think, would be the 2 areas that we would continue to prioritize.  I would likely see that kind of phase more second half. Certainly, with the new guide in our plan, some of that will happen in Q2, but it will probably be more kind of spread throughout the year is the way to think about that. Yes, Larry, thanks for the question. Yes, the full balance to go is actually equal to our guide. What we did signal though was Q2, we're still navigating through kind of a recovery period, if you remember the resurgence last year. So it's really more I would think of it as kind of outsized on the BDI side of the business, in particular.  There are a couple of small comp dynamics in Q4 as well, right? We had some new product launches. So if you look at the comp from last year, it's very strong. So it's really just more comp dynamics, I think, as it relates to 5 5 plus for the long term, that this more than validates that we're well on track and strong there. As a matter of fact, our continuing to look at growth versus '19 as an example, too, is extremely strong, actually moving to over 5% with -- and that's -- and considering the fact that you have a year of COVID in there, that's a strong signal for the trajectory of the business. Larry, just one other quick thing. I don't know if this helps, I wasn't sure if your comment was operational. But obviously, the FX phasing will be certainly more back-end loaded in terms of the negative currency impact, maybe another consideration.  And then further to just Tom's comment on pricing from a progress standpoint, I think what I can share, we did not split out the dynamic, but it's part of our plan as it relates to -- we talked about an inflation impact and then cost improvement programs and price. Cost improvement is actually a large portion of it, to Tom's point, where we're getting a net 50 basis points improvement for the full year of the 200 basis points. The other 150 is coming from volume and strong growth and some FX benefit that carried over from last year.  And on pricing, we entered the year with plans, with 80%, 90% of firm plans in place and 50% of that action. We now have 100% plans fully identified and 7% of it is already fully executed, with the balance really more timing tied to triggers and other events. So really good progress there. Just one small add that may help you think about how this sort of could play out through the year. Inflationary impacts kind of started more in the second half of last year, right? So as you go through this year, what you're going to see in the first half is kind of a full impact of continued inflation. As you get to the back half, you'll see some stabilization to some continuous increases, but to a smaller degree. And then think of the opposite as it relates to kind of the offsets that will drive, call it, the net, right? That will ramp a little bit slower, although we were -- we actually exceeded our expectations for Q1, but you have just sort of the natural ramp that happens as you put actions into place throughout the year. So that may help you as you sort of think of the timing dynamics.  We did talk about GP or GP operating margin, Q2 kind of being the low watermark as it relates to the full impact of inflation flowing through. And that is GP and up margin because a lot of the inflation is also in the area of shipping. So you should think of both line items in that regard."

            "name": "Simon Campion",
            "content": "Matthew, Simon. Yes, I'd be happy to provide that information, but before I do so, I think it's fair to say we're reasonably happy with the performance of BDI in the quarter. And with respect to PI, we're happy with the position of that portfolio. We're happy with our competitiveness. We're happy with our ability to continue to strengthen that portfolio as you've seen the acquisition of Venclose during the quarter.  So the issues we face are -- I would classify them as extremely acute in nature and I feel time-bound. Three issues generally have been the source of the majority of the problem today. But this time last year, we recalled the Venovo venous stent and so we've got a headwind for 4 quarters at this point in time.  We expect 2 things from that. Number one, it's almost annualized. And number two, we do expect it to be back in the market in the second half of this financial year. And just to reiterate, that is not an implant issue. In fact, in September of last year, we published 3-year data from the [indiscernible] study on Venovo, which showed 84% [indiscernible] and 0 fractures and 0 migration. So we are very confident that this is going to have an impact on the market again.  Second issue was the backorder and supplier challenges in the NPI. PI does have the most complex portfolio, the most complex products and the most complex supply chain certainly within BDI. And we've experienced headwinds from raw material capacity to COVID impact in supplier sites to sterilization capacity in the past number of quarters. We do see light at the end of the tunnel on a number of those issues, particularly in relation to sterilization. And we expect to begin to see material improvements in our performance with respect to back order by the end of this quarter.  And then finally, as Chris and Tom have remarked, SKU rationalization has impacted PI more so than any other business this past quarter. And as we discussed in other fora, these product discontinuations are being done strategically with a view to enhancing margins and increasing efficiencies across our entire cycle from manufacturing to sales rep time allocation."

Earlier today, we reported our results for the fourth quarter and full year of FY '23, a year characterized by strong differentiated performance driven by our BD 2025 strategy in action, impactful new innovations and our diversified business portfolio designed to help our customers navigate today's challenging environment. The diversification of our portfolio offers both durability through our leading positions and consistent demand for products essential to everyday patient care and strong growth through a purposeful shift into higher growth markets, anchored against three irreversible forces we see shaping health care, connected care, new care settings and chronic disease. Additionally, we have built capabilities and fostered a culture of operational excellence, where we make disciplined and strategic capital allocation choices, proactively address macro headwinds through our simplification programs and execute with speed and agility, all of which have and continue to play a key role in delivering strong consistent performance. This unique profile can be seen in both our current and 2-year performance and where our purposeful shift into higher growth markets has enabled us to drive the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile. In FY '23, we delivered 7% base revenue growth with base organic growth of 5.8%. Our team drove significant margin expansion and delivered $12.21 in adjusted EPS, which represents double-digit currency-neutral growth of 11%. Over the past 2 years, we have made excellent progress toward our BD 2025 financial targets, delivering a 7% base organic revenue CAGR and 390 basis points of operating margin expansion. We are now over 70% of the wave 2 and tracking ahead of our 25% adjusted operating margin target by FY '25. As a result, on the bottom line, we delivered an implied base EPS CAGR of 20% currency neutral. We also ended FY '23 with strong execution of our strategic priorities. First, we delivered our number one priority, obtaining FDA clearance for the updated BD Alaris [ph] infusion system. Post clearance, our priority remains remediation, scaling up manufacturing and engaging with customers on the many benefits of the updated system that include advanced cybersecurity, wireless connectivity and other clinical and patient safety upgrades. We are confident in our remediation plan and have begun the process, prioritizing our existing customers. We are making good progress with active contracting and shipments of our first units to customers taking place ahead of schedule at the end of September. We are excited to deliver the benefits of the updated Alaris system to our customers and their patients, including the power of one integrated infusion platform with a centralized user interface for all major types of infusion as well as the value added through interoperability and other innovations that connect data from Alaris, Pyxis and the rest of our medication management offering into the industry's only end-to-end solution for safer, simpler and smarter medication management from the pharmacy to the floor, to the bedside. The clearance of the BD Alaris infusion system gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets. Second, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 27 key new products that benefit researchers, providers and patients, integrating AI, robotics and other advanced technologies. Our products are helping researchers gain deeper insights faster, like our fax Discover S8 cell sorter with CellView image technology and facts to at premium sample preparation system, which apply novel technologies like high-speed cell imaging and liquid handling robotics and our BD Horizon real yellow and real blue reagents, which were developed using AI guidance. Our pharmacy automation business continues to grow double digits and it's helping our customers serve patients more efficiently and with fewer errors across various care settings. Our robotic microbiology platform, BD Kiestra, hit record sales this year, and we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in our BD COR and BD MAX molecular platforms, leveraging our growing installed base through menu expansion that includes our new Vaginal Panel and our Onclarity HPV assay for thin prep on BD core and now greater than 20 assays on BD MAX. We continue to enable the care shift in new settings, including at home, through innovations such as our PureWick system franchise for urinary incontinence that we expanded to include solutions for male patients. PureWick Mail has been one of the fastest ramps of a new product in our history and continues to exceed our expectations. Given the strong adoption, we have now designated this as a greater than $50 million incremental growth opportunity. Pharmaceutical Systems, which achieved 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, continues to empower the delivery of new biologics, many administered by patients at home, such as the growing drug class of GLP-1s for diabetes and weight loss and other molecules, which will be delivered through our self-injection solutions. We are playing an increasing role in addressing chronic diseases like peripheral arterial disease and improving outcomes in tissue reconstruction. This year, we expanded the impact of new products such as our Rotarex Atherectomy system, Venous Stent System and then close RF ablation catheter, helping to address an area of high unmet need for the 10 million patients each year who are suffering from venous disease. In surgery, our teams accelerated the growth of Phasix Mesh to allow more patients to benefit from tissue repair performed with our resorbable synthetic biomaterial. And of course, we continue to drive a relentless focus on improving clinician and patient satisfaction with PIVO Pro and BD Nexiva with near Port IV access, a core element of our OneStick hospital stay vision that enables needleless blood draws, which is a major satisfaction for patients. And BD Pyxis ES 1.7.4, which now fully integrates our C2 Safe system into the Pyxis ES platform, enabling security and automated controlled substance management for pharmacists. I'm really pleased with how our R&D team executed in FY '23, again reaching a new record level of on-time milestones and launches. Our enhanced focus on programs with the potential to move the needle in terms of growth has positioned us well to drive our WAMGR expansion. We are on track to both achieve our target of over 100 new product launches by FY '25 and our new product revenue contribution target as outlined at Investor Day, creating a new wave of margin accretive growth for BD. Third, in addition to our investments in R&D, our tuck-in M&A strategy has been very impactful, targeted in higher-growth markets, M&A is complementing the plus side of our 5.5% plus growth profile and also contributing to growth on an organic basis as we anniversary those assets. This includes our acquisition of Parata Systems, which is part of our pharmacy automation business that is growing double digits. At nearly $700 million in revenue, BD Pharmacy Automation is one of the largest robotics and health care process automation businesses in med tech, focused on improving pharmacy labor efficiency and reducing errors. There's never been a greater need for these solutions. Fourth, we continued our simplification initiatives in FY '23 and actively managed our portfolio, divesting our surgical instrumentation business and executing a program of strategic portfolio exits, allowing us to continue to reallocate our resources into more strategic, higher growth areas and further reduce complexity across our company. We also progressed our project Reco network [ph] and SKU rationalization programs, exiting more than 2,300 incremental SKUs in FY '23 and are pleased that we have now streamlined our portfolio by 20% compared to 2019, achieving our goal laid out at Investor Day 2 years early. We are seeing the benefits in our manufacturing plants and in our simplified portfolio with customers. We will continue to advance this initiative as we keep executing BD 2025. In addition, we initiated our operating model simplification initiative to reduce our organizational complexity and increase agility. As a result, we were able to absorb continued outsized inflation during the year as planned and advanced operating margins towards our 25% target. And lastly, we strengthened our balance sheet, inclusive of executing on our planned inventory reductions and maintaining a disciplined and balanced capital deployment framework. This allows us to support organic and inorganic investments in growth while returning capital to shareholders. We just announced our 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. Lastly, I'm also very pleased with how we've advanced our ESG strategy and goals. In July, we published our 2022 ESG report, which provides details about our strategy and progress against our 2030 plus commitments. Highlights include progress in health equity and diversity as well as improving our environmental footprint, which included a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 10% and having generated 34% of our electric power from renewable energy. In FY '23, we submitted our GHG emission reduction targets to the science-based target initiative for verification. I'm quite excited by our innovative circular economy pilots we did this past year. They were the first of their kind in our industry. Recycling medical waste like use syringes and vacutainers and converting these materials back into usable resins. We'll be advancing this work further in FY '24 as we continue to tackle end-of-life GHG emissions and seek to lead circular economy innovation within our industry. We also continue to pioneer products and solutions that address health and equities, like our efforts to detect HPV infections and diagnose cervical cancer through at-home sample collection. We're proud that our progress continues to be recognized externally with BD most recently named among the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL and among the top 2 in the health care equipment and services industry. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD2025 as we look forward to FY '24. Starting with the macro environment. The complexity facing all companies will likely persist and in some cases, is accelerating. With China responding to economic pressures and elevated levels of geopolitical uncertainty occurring in multiple markets. Inflation has moderated from the peak high levels overall, but remains elevated compared to prepandemic norms, including higher labor rates in transportation and manufacturing, higher cost of energy and certain raw materials. While there continues to be a heightened degree of macro uncertainty as we head into FY '24, consistent with what we have done in the past several years, we have positioned BD to deliver strong performance through this environment. As we move forward, you can expect to see continued execution of VD2025 with a focus on the bold actions that position BD strategically for the future. These include continuing to advance our strong organic portfolio of programs in higher-growth spaces that are transforming health care. This includes launching another 25 key new products, including our Phase 6 ST umbilical product that will provide patients a reliable alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of our bioresorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. The BD multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy device, which is expected to be the first VAB system designed to work across all 3 imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI allows our customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training. Our next-generation PureWick incontinence solution for the hospital and the home will be launching in FY '24. And our FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter 3 and 4 laser configuration that will expand our new-to-world cell sorting instrument to the mid-parameter segment to help more researchers drive new discoveries. We're also launching our Libertas 5 ML device that will provide a wearable option for higher viscous drugs that tend to require longer dosing times. And finally, our BD next-generation infusion pump for Europe. These are just a few examples of the 25 key new product launches planned for FY '24. We will also continue to simplify our organization this year to enable operational excellence and agility, fuel investment and deliver on initiatives that will help us achieve our 25% adjusted operating margin goal in FY '25. this includes our Project Recode initiatives where our network optimization efforts will start Generating savings in FY '24 as we drive plant efficiencies and our operating model efforts where we are seeing positive early results from outsourcing certain back-office functions. As we accelerate our focus on BD Excellence, our unique business performance system, we will increase the adoption of lean principles beyond manufacturing with pilots outside of operations this year. I see our BD excellence system as an important new lever we're building as we look ahead and think about our strategic plans beyond BD 2025. And lastly, we expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. This includes ongoing transformation of our portfolio by deploying capital towards larger tuck-in acquisitions and in higher growth categories that we can scale and leverage to support our growth and margin goals. As I said at the top of the call, in fiscal 2023, our teams demonstrated exceptional agility and strong execution, advancing our BD 2025 strategy. We are delivering consistent durable performance in a challenging environment, which we expect to persist for several years to come. Our continued track record, combined with our growing pipeline and shift into higher growth markets is propelling us into a more innovative leader that is making a profound impact on advancing health care globally. We are advancing into FY '24 with clarity, focus and a growth mindset as we seek to do great things for those who rely on us, our customers, patients, associates and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. We delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year, which reflect the diversity of our portfolio and our BD 2025 strategy in action. Beginning with our revenue performance. We delivered $5.1 billion in revenue in Q4, exceeding our expectations with base organic growth of 7% and total base growth of 6.3%, which reflects the impact from the surgical instrumentation divestiture. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $19.4 billion in revenue with base organic revenue growth of 5.8% that is 100 basis points higher than our initial guidance. Total base revenue growth was 7%, driven by strong performance in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with high single-digit growth in EMEA and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. and Greater Asia despite low single-digit growth in China. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from higher-growth spaces that are driving the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 40 basis points for the full year. Over a 2-year period, we drove a strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 6.2% with strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems. BD Medical performance reflects a decline in medication delivery systems resulting from softness in China driven by market dynamics, including some impacts from volume-based procurement. This was partially offset by strong performance in catheter solutions in North America and Europe through continued execution of our vascular access management strategy. MMS delivered exceptional growth of 13.7%, driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and pharmacy automation as customers focus on solutions, which improve workflows and efficiencies and help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages. Pharmaceutical Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6% driven by continued strong demand for prefillable solutions for biologics, partially offset by a slowdown in China exports of anticoagulants. Ed Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 3.8%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Biosciences. Life Sciences base business growth reflects IDS base business growth of 0.6%, driven by continued adoption of our BD KIESTRA microbiology lab automation solution and strong IDAST instrument placements and continued growth of our molecular IVD assays, leveraging the BD core system and our expanded BD MAX installed base. Growth was partially offset by the comparison to prior year COVID-related recovery in China and a decline in specimen management that was driven by distributor and customer stocking in the prior year. PDB [ph] grew 11.7%, driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD Fax Discover SH cell sorter that is enabling an entirely new level of biological depth of speed, ease of use and solution integration for researchers across fields like immunology, cancer research and cell biology. BDs performance also reflects strong growth in clinical reagents, leveraging our increasing installed base of FaxleRic [ph] analyzers in facto-ed automation. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 9.6% and 12.8% organic. The strong double-digit organic growth was driven by surgery growth of 5% or 15.5% organic, which excludes the impact from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation platform of 10.5 percentage points. Organic growth reflects strong market adoption of our leading Phasix Hardie products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. PI grew 11.7%, which reflects strong performance in peripheral vascular disease driven by global penetration of the rotor atherectomy system and our venous portfolio in China. Growth was aided by improved supply and distribution stabilization in EMEA following a new ERP implementation in fiscal '22. Urology grew 11.7%, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions in both the acute care and alternative care settings. Now moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.42 reflects strong double-digit growth of 24% or 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 52.6%, and as anticipated, we delivered very strong margin improvement with adjusted operating margin of 25.4%, up 340 basis points. As expected, margin improvement was driven by leverage on our strong revenue performance, our ability to offset outsized inflation, lower SSG&A driven by our simplification initiatives, moderated R&D expense as a percent of sales due to investment timing and a favorable comparison to last year's COVID profit reinvestment. Full year adjusted diluted EPS of $12.21 grew 7.6% or 11% currency-neutral. This includes delivering an additional $0.14 of currency-neutral earnings versus our original guidance. Additionally, we absorbed almost 400 basis points associated with reduced COVID-only testing, implying base currency-neutral EPS growth of approximately 15%. For the full year, gross margin of 53.5% was flat to the prior year despite absorbing over 200 basis points of outsized inflation and cost of goods sold. Operating margin of 23.5% was up about 90 basis points or 110 basis points when excluding the 20 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item, exceeding our margin goal for the year. The employee benefit item is recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. While delivering our margin goals, we also maintained investment in R&D at 6% of sales or about $1.2 billion to advance our pipeline of innovation programs that will support our strong growth profile in fiscal year '24 and beyond. As anticipated, we made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals. Our FY '23 adjusted operating margin is ahead of our 2019 spin adjusted margin, which is particularly significant given it includes overcoming 500 basis points or almost $1 billion of outsized inflation in the past 3 years. Over the next 2 years, we remain well positioned to return to our targeted 25% operating margins. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $3 billion in FY '23. As expected, cash flow accelerated over the back half of the year and was strongest in Q4 due to normalization of working capital, including continued moderation of our inventory balances. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and as anticipated, delivered a step-up in FY '23 with free cash flow increasing by over $600 million. We are planning another step improvement in FY '24 and expect free cash flow to increase double digits. This will be achieved through further moderation of inventory levels by the end of the year and continued discipline around CapEx investments through focused prioritization and areas of targeted reduction, both of which we expect to more than offset cash investments to support the Alaris remediation. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%. Beyond our investments in growth, we paid down over $700 million in debt this fiscal year and returned $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.4 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.6 times This is our strongest net leverage position since FY '21, which positions us well to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our investment in higher-growth categories through our tuck-in M&A strategy. Moving to our guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. As demonstrated by our results over the past 2 years, BD has the ability to deliver strong performance in the most challenging times. Our performance reflects strong execution of our BD 2025 strategy, the benefit of our diversified and durable portfolio or simplification and outsized cost improvement programs and bold, purposeful capital allocation and investment decisions, all further optimized by our ability to execute with agility. As we look to fiscal '24, while the macro landscape has evolved since our last earnings call, I'm pleased to share we remain committed to the revenue growth profile we previously outlined. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver another year of organic growth above our 5.5% plus profile. Let me share some of the key puts and takes contemplated in our guidance. First, we see strong momentum in many parts of our business. We have 6 key areas in our portfolio now totaling over $5 billion or 25% of our sales that we expect to deliver high single to double-digit growth. These include our farm systems pre-fillable syringes, which are benefiting from the strong trends in biologics, our bioscience business, our peripheral vascular disease platform, our medication management systems business, including pharmacy automation and infusion given the recent clear Delaris pump, urinary incontinence supported by our PureWick franchise; and finally, our molecular diagnostic platforms. This allows us to deliver strong results despite some heightened macro dynamics affecting many industries, most notably in China, along with increasing risk and complexity as the result of the war in the Middle East and other geographies. Specific to the health care industry, providers continue to feel the pressure of elevated inflation and labor dynamics. And while they remain very focused on cost and working capital management, our portfolio has proven to be more resilient in this type of environment given BD's essential role in the health care ecosystem and our ability to transform health care processes and drive efficiencies. As it relates to BD, the largest headwind we anticipate from these macro dynamics is in our China business, where we see market softness and increasing levels of volume-based procurement, predominantly impacting our MDS business along with some impact in farm systems from reduced demand as our Chinese pharmaceutical customers export business slow. As a result, we are projecting China to be flat to modest growth in FY '24, which creates nearly a 75 basis point headwind to our revenue growth this year. Taking these factors into account, we expect to deliver base organic growth of about 6% at the midpoint, which is consistent with the view we provided on our last earnings call. We still expect COVID-only testing to step down from the $73 million reported this year and result in a headwind to organic growth of over 25 basis points. This brings the midpoint of our total organic growth to 5.75% within our 5.25% to 6.25% range. To help simplify our reporting, unless there's a significant change in the COVID-only testing market. Effective this year, we will no longer be reporting base organic growth that excludes COVID-only testing. However, it was important to give us context with our initial guidance. As a reminder, while the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform that closed in Q4 FY '23 does not impact our organic growth, we'll have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total revenue growth in FY '24 and is accounted for in our total currency-neutral revenue growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%. Moving to margins and earnings. We plan to deliver another year of strong profitable growth, including progressing our adjusted operating margin towards our FY '25 goal of 25%, while generating cash flow improvements to support our strong and reliable growth profile. On gross margin, we expect to be about flat year-over-year on a reported basis, including the impact of currency headwinds of approximately 75 basis points. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect gross margin to improve with our simplification strategy more than offsetting 150 basis points of headwinds from outsized inflation of about 100 basis points and another 50 basis points from inventory reduction efforts that occurred in FY '23 and that we plan to further moderate down by the end of FY '24, which will improve cash flow. The value from our simplification programs continue to be driven by our recode network optimization, SKU rationalization and operating model simplification programs. Additionally, our BD excellence program, which focuses on the application of lean principles is driving productivity gains across our operations. As it pertains to OpEx, we anticipate SG&A expense leverage on strong revenue performance and continued benefit from our operating model simplification programs. After 3 consecutive years of investing in R&D at over 6% on average, in FY '24, we anticipate a consistent year-to-year dollar spend in R&D that is needed to advance our pipeline, which will result in some modest leverage. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin to improve by around 50 basis points on a reported basis over the 23.5% reported in FY '23, primarily driven by SSG&A leverage. This puts us well on track to achieve our 25% margin goal by FY '25. For tax, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13% and 15%. As a reminder, it would not be unusual for our tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Given all these considerations, we expect adjusted EPS growth before the impact of currency of 8.25% to 10.25% or 9.25% at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about a 75 basis point headwind from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation business, and as a result, implies double-digit earnings growth, excluding the divestiture of 10% at the midpoint and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance we provide perspective on currency using current spot rates, consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar, along with normal FX translation, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we also faced the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L, including the impact from the sourcing and timing of inventory production and movements throughout our network. Since our last call in August, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against most major currencies and the change over this time period accounts for nearly two thirds of the expected FX impact. Additionally, as it relates to sourcing from Mexico, where we have a large manufacturing footprint, the dollar weakened versus the peso by about 10%, taking the average rate over the last 4 months ending in October versus the average over the first 9 months of fiscal year '23, with the peso achieving peak rates that in that time frame had not been seen in well over 5 years. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency is estimated to be a headwind with approximately 75 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 375 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis. All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $20.1 billion to $20.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $12.70 to $13, which represents growth of 4% to 6.5%. As a reminder, currency can fluctuate over time, and it would not be prudent to deviate from our investment profile that is resulting in consistently strong base organic growth, which is delivering an expected 3-year base organic CAGR of about 6.8%, well above our 5.5% plus growth profile. We continue to deliver margin improvement, resulting in earnings growing 1.3x the rate of sales. And with our focus on improved cash conversion, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. As you think of fiscal '24 phasing, the following are considerations for Q1 in context on how revenue and margin will index through the remainder of the year. As it relates to Q1, we expect organic revenue growth to under index the full year by over 200 basis points, and we expect a decline in adjusted EPS versus the prior year of about $0.55 to $0.60. There are 3 key items to consider First, sales was driven by the prior year base and COVID-only respiratory testing comparison, along with the market dynamics in China. These impacts are about equally weighted and primarily impact the IDS and MDS business with a modest impact in farm systems associated with China. We also expect Alaris revenues to ramp over the year and be weighted to the second half. Second, we expect operating margin to decline by around 350 basis points on a reported basis in Q1 with 200 basis points driven by inventory-related FX dynamics and another 200 basis points from the negative absorption impact from our planned inventory reductions, which we expect to partially offset through our simplification and cost mitigation initiatives while also overcoming outsized inflation. Lastly, we had a discrete tax item in Q1 of last year that creates a negative comparison. As you think about the remainder of the year, we expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the ramp-up of Alaris. We expect our Q2 margins to expand significantly on a sequential basis, resulting in year-over-year operating margin being nearly flat on a reported basis or slightly up on a currency-neutral basis. In closing, we are very pleased with our performance this past year, particularly given our ability to navigate another year of significant macro complexity and inflationary pressure. The momentum in our durable and strong portfolio, along with our track record of successfully executing and delivering against our commitments, gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '24 and create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Let me take a moment to thank our talented employees across BD who through growth mindset and an unwavering commitment to our purpose or core to delivering this performance. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on how you think about reported EPS growth because the range of $12.70 to $13 is just slightly higher than the original guidance for fiscal '20 of 12 [ph] I believe, 1,250 to 12.65. So just thinking about how you're managing reported EPS versus underlying organic constant currency EPS and how we should think about your ability to deliver the double-digit reported EPS growth going forward? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Robbie, thanks for the question. First of all, our guide range obviously reflects - we basically try and match the top line. So if you look at the top line, you've got about 1 point on the range in total. I mean you dollarize that, take the dollar of sales take margin drop-through on that. It basically mirrors kind of the number of earnings that you have on either side. So there's symmetry between the sales, the drop through at some margin level that's between, call it, GP and EPS. So it contemplates both upside on sales and reinvesting back in the business or vice versa on the downside, basically the opposite. So I mean that's the logic for the range. I think it's pretty consistent with - it modifies year-over-year depending on how you actually set those points and what each point is worth I think more importantly, look, our commitments, we can't control currency, first of all. So we always think of things on an FXN basis. If you look at our FY '24 guide this year, I think there's a lot of strong things. The underlying performance of the business is really strong. Let's start with the top line. So if you remember, last quarter, we talked about delivering 6% organic growth. That was excluding the impact of the COVID-only testing, which we expect to step down by about 25 basis points. That would establish a midpoint range of, call it, 5.75%, which is very strong. It's above our 5.5% plus average. Our 2-year average heading into this year, plus this year at the midpoint would imply a CAGR of just under 7% organic growth. When you think about from the time that we mentioned kind of the direction we were heading 3 months ago to where we are now, looking at the top line, the macro environment certainly got more complex. I think for us, China was one of the dynamics that we called out, there's about a 75 basis point headwind that we're contemplating in our guide that's actually absorbed in that growth rate. So it actually implies excluding that organic growth of north of 6%. So really strong to be able to absorb that. I think this shows the resiliency of the BD portfolio, the diversified nature and all the work that we're doing to drive growth in these transformative spaces. We've talked about 6 key areas that as we think of our guide, kicking both, one, they're helping deliver the midpoint there and can create opportunity for upside. So that's farm systems. That's our MMS portfolio, including pharmacy automation on the back of Parada, our Rowa business, infusion, obviously, with the clearance of Alaris now, our bioscience research, peripheral vascular disease, molecular diagnostics and urinary incontinence. From an earnings standpoint, again, on an FXN basis, it's extremely consistent with what we shared last quarter. There's a couple of small puts and takes in here, but basically excluding our divestiture of eMeler [ph] we're anchored right at double-digit growth at the midpoint. At the top end, we're actually 11%, excluding the eMeler divestiture. So even with that divestiture, we have double-digit EPS growth in the top end of our earnings range. Again, there's 2 things that I would say that are different from last time. That includes us again absorbing the China headwind, which actually comes with some pricing dynamics. So really think of stronger underlying earnings to offset and absorb that. Plus, we've been very focused on cash. So with our strong margin profile, we made an intentional decision to continue to drive inventory levels down, especially in an environment where you have cash earning at high interest, it creates an opportunity and you have inflation flowing through inventory, keeping your inventory levels lower, create strong value creation. That creates a 50 basis point headwind through the year on margin, but that's an intentional choice and we're doing that because we have a strong cost to win program, leverage on our top line growth that we've consistently been driving and we can still drive towards our 25% goal by 2025. I think that focus on cash, one thing that even despite the FX, remember, FX, we don't control FX, I think a couple of the dynamics to think about, we literally had a 5% FX movement across our 5 major currencies since the last guide. It's unprecedented that they all go the same way. On top of that, we had a dynamic where some of our core, call it, expense-only sourcing locations, think of Mexico, where we have a huge manufacturing organization. We saw a 10% movement in that currency, where the peso actually strengthened against the dollar. We're not alone in this. Every company has been talking about it in Q4, adjusting their Q4. We're one of the first to report a full fiscal year. Many have signaled that, that will be coming in their results as well. The good news is one of the reasons that we focus on underlying is FX is not a true cash for cash impact. Some of this FX is pure translational. It does not affect our underlying cash. As a matter of fact, when you think of the cash flow for BD that we're thinking of in 2024 because of that strong FXN earnings growth profile on the back of strong top line growth and the continued cash conversion that we want to improve, we're going to drive double-digit cash flow from a free cash flow standpoint. So ultimate value creation happens with cash, and it's one of our core focus areas going forward. So I think FY '24, again, it's actually outsized versus our top line commitments that we've made as part of our Investor Day. We continue to drive margin improvement. We continue to deliver double-digit FX and earnings growth, and we actually have outsized cash flow growth - the FX is unfortunate, it's unprecedented. We don't control that. I think we're focused on continuing to drive long-term value. It would actually be value destructive to take outsized actions and try and cover that. So hopefully, that context all helps.\nRobbie Marcus: Yes. Very helpful. And you talked a lot about operating margins. It came in below - the Street in fourth quarter and just below the fiscal '23 guide. And first quarter is coming in pretty far substantially sequentially down. How do we think about your confidence levels for being able to achieve the stated operating margin guidance in the back half of the year? Thanks a lot.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Great question. So first of all, 23, I mean, look, we delivered exactly against our commitments from the beginning of the year. As a matter of fact, we increased our organic growth by over 100 basis points from our original guide. We increased our earnings $0.14 on an FXN basis, taking out the currency noise, which actually was favorable as that we advanced through the year. Margin, we fully delivered. Remember, there's a small accounting adjustment from employee benefits that actually gets adjusted in another line item. We're actually over our commitment when you think of that. So we're really pleased with what we did on FY '23. I think the last I looked, there's maybe less than a handful of companies, 2 or 3 that are able to drive margin improvement from the start of this outsized inflation. So over the last 3 years, we've absorbed $1 billion of outsized inflation while improving our margin by almost 400 basis points. So really proud of the organization and strong commitment to executing against that. It's a great question on '24. I actually view '24 in some ways, dress. So here's the criteria as you think of '24. So one, we have another 100 basis points of outsized inflation. Most of that is in labor. There's some other input costs, some packaging fuel. We have 50 basis points that we've actually made the choice around this absorption from lowering our inventories to drive outside cash. So that's an intentional choice that's in our plan because we do have such a strong cost improvement program in place to offset those and still achieve our long-term margin goals. And then we have 75 basis points of FX. We're going to more than absorb that with 225 basis points of cost to win price mix in GP. So gross margin for the year will be about flat. And then we have about 50 basis points coming from SG&A leverage and some of the benefits from our operating model simplification plan. So that's kind of the full year dynamic. In the quarter, to your point, we talked about a 350 basis point headwind in the quarter. But you have 2 large onetime items. Almost all of the FX is indexed towards Q1 and almost 100% of that inventory choice is also happening in Q1. Those are about 200 basis points, respectively. The 100 basis points of outsized inflation is over-indexed in Q1 at about 175 basis points. What that implies is we're actually driving underlying about 225 to 250 basis points of cost improvement that are offsetting those items. The other thing to think of is if you look at last year as an analog and for 8 quarters now, we've been very predictive in what our margin would do quarter-over-quarter, and we fully executed against the commitments we've made externally. So one, there's credibility and that gives us confidence. But if you look at last year, we needed a little over 200 basis points on average in the back half. And as everyone knows, it was weighted towards Q4. This year, you'll see a little bit more balanced in the second half, but we do need another year of a little over 200 basis points of margin improvement in the second half. By Q2, we get back to flat. The good news is last year, we were absorbing 200 basis points of outsized inflation. This year, it's only 100 basis points of outsized inflation and a lot of that is happening in the front end, right? So the back end gets easier, and it's half of the challenge that we had last year when you think of outsized inflation. So it's the same amount of margin improvement we need in the back half with half of the outsized inflation in the back half. And given the fact that we're already delivering about 225 to 250 basis points of cost to win, pricing mix benefits in Q1. If that continues throughout the year, which we have strong plans that execute against that, we feel really confident with our margin goals for the year.\nTom Polen: Ravi, this is Tom. Just to add to Chris's excellent summary there, just to call out, we feel great about the performance in FY '23 as well as our outlook for '24. And just to give a little bit more detail on that inventory number. So in Q3, you saw meaningful improvements in our cash flow, including a $200 million reduction in inventory. In Q4, if you haven't seen yet, it's a $300 million reduction in our inventory in Q4 that we just achieved. Obviously, that - the inventory reduces within that quarter, the variance is then from producing less inventory from manufacturing, caps and rolls into the first half of next year. And so just to put it in perspective the scale that we've been taking inventory down at. And obviously, that has a meaningful benefit to cash flow and why we see such strong cash flow, growing nice double digits next year all in, which is really enables our continued strategy on our tuck-in M&A strategy, investing behind growth, right, continuing to drive the flywheel. Thanks again for the question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question Sorry, there were a lot of numbers being thrown around. But if you can just -- let's start with Q1 on the top line com. Your Q4 performance was pretty impressive. I think for Q1, you said 200 basis points below the annual guide. Your comps don't seem crazy, right? It's pretty easy. So what's changing here? What are you assuming for pricing China headwinds Aleris?\nTom Polen: Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay and Chris will take that.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. Yes. On sales, we indicated that our organic growth in Q1 was under-indexed by 200 basis points. There's really 2 factors, maybe 3. The key factors are, one, the respiratory testing dynamics, both in our base and the COVID only, which we're going to now just report as our base business, right? It was still more indexed in Q1 of last year. So as that normalizes year-over-year. The other one is some of the China slowdown that I noted, which is mostly in our medical business, we're still seeing strong performance, in particular, in BDI, which has been a source of strength for us. The good news is we've baked that into our planning by the time that we ramp up to the back of the year that normalizes throughout the year. So those are the 2 small items. The third one I would point to, of course, that we've articulated is the Alaris. As that comes back, we talked about that being a ramp throughout the year. So those are probably the key 3 considerations. To your point, I think especially on the back of absorbing 75 basis points of a China headwind in our growth rate, 5.75 really implies organic growth of 6% north. So it's just -- it's another year of really strong performance. I think it's -- when you think of BD, we're not dependent on one area of growth. I think that offers a source of confidence in complex times like this. And I think the growth is broad-based, right? We talked about the 6 key areas within our portfolio that offer opportunity to deliver that outsized growth of either high single digits to double digits. So we continue to focus on that, transforming our portfolio through organic investments in R&D and the tuck-in work we've done. If you noticed '23, the impact from our tuck-in acquisitions are now contributing 40 basis points to growth after having anniversaried them for 1 year.\nTom Polen: And Vijay, just to add on. Obviously, with Aleris, we've always said, of course, typically from when we start booking installations, then we get contracts into 3 to 6 months from then that we actually start doing the installations, et cetera. And obviously, we started just a little over 90 days ago, engaging with customers. And so we're really pleased. We're making solid progress with Alaris, very constructive discussions. We started shipping. We've gotten our first contracts in place, but those will just take time to move through and therefore, we see the bigger ramp in the back half of the year. That's natural for that selling cycle. The other thing is, as Chris mentioned, we've made some assumptions for Q1 on respiratory testing and COVID levels being notably lower than last year. Obviously, that's to be determined. That could be an opportunity there depending on how the respiratory season plays out.\nVijay Kumar: Understood, Tom. And then one on margins here. I think in the Q1 gross margin is 350 basis points below. I just maintain your OpEx dollars, I still end up with an operating margin close to 21.5%. I think your guidance is implying sub-20% for Q1. So is there some investments that's being pulled forward into Q1? And I think you mentioned gross margin flattish year-on-year. Are you planning to exit at 55%? Like what drives the gross margin from 51% to 55% as the year progresses?\nTom Polen: Yes. You're talking specifically about Q1?\nVijay Kumar: Q1 op margins, yes and gross margin progression?\nTom Polen: Yes. So again, I mean, Q1 has - there's really 2 onetime dynamics in there. You have FX that's 200 basis points and you have the inventory take down, right? So the onetime impact of taking on increased absorption in your cost base, it's 400 basis points, all happening in Q1 that basically goes away. The FX becomes much smaller and more normalized throughout the year. The inventory is predominantly done in Q1. That goes away. You also have the outsized inflation that on average through the year is 100 basis points, but Q1 is more elevated because you have a carryover effect from last year. It's about 175 basis points. The good news again is we have really strong underlying cost improvements. I mean, at this point, Recode, which is supposed to deliver about $300 million savings as we enter into FY '20, 25. We're achieving about two thirds to 70% of that savings in this year. So we've made significant progress. We've actually fully completed the SKU rationalization program in terms of simplifying our SKU portfolio. We're not stopping there. We're going to actually increase that goal. There's more opportunity to go. So you have kind of 2 discrete onetime items in Q1, but the underlying and cost improvement are driving. We just need to maintain that throughout the year, and we'll be fine. Similar to what I shared before on Robbie's question was, last year, we had to deliver 200 basis points of margin improvement, a little bit north of that in the back half. We have to do the same thing this year. But last year, there was 200 basis points of outsized inflation. This year, there's half of outsized inflation. So we actually feel really strong. That's what's afforded us the opportunity to actually look at our inventory harder and maybe take some more aggressive goals, driving that down and driving improved cash. Again, FY '24 year that's going to have double-digit free cash flow growth year-over-year.\nVijay Kumar: So sorry, the OpEx dollars, are you expecting it to be constant sequentially? Or is that stepping up, Chris?\nChris DelOrefice: I mean there's - we can follow up. But there are timing on. If you remember last year, I mean, there are some timing dynamics you're going to see. R&D, you're going to see is much more normalized this year. That's one area I would point to. So I think you should expect to see OpEx actually down a little bit in the first half of the year, partially because of that when you're looking at pure SSG&A spend and R&D spend, and then that will renormalize in the back half of the year. We were very front-end loaded with R&D this year in '23. And then we moderated it back in the second half due to timing of programs, milestones and things like that. This year is more normalized, and we're going to spend about the same in R&D year-over-year from a dollar base. That's probably the one key thing I would point to.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. Just I'd love to focus on China a little bit, 13% decline in Q4. What were the drivers of that? How much was the anticorruption initiative versus VBP? And how are sales going to be flat to up in fiscal '24, given the Q4 decline. And just one follow-up on fiscal '24, Chris. The tax guidance, does that include the Pillar 2 changes? And how should we think about the tax rate going forward? And the FX headwind of 75 bps to sales, how can that be a 375 basis point impact to EPS?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate the question. Let me take the last 2 first, I guess. First of all, BD, we started our fiscal year before everyone else. So Pillar 2 is not contemplated more applicable to us in fiscal year '24. We continue to assess those dynamics. We expect a lot more information as this year progresses. We'll share more on that at a future date. Obviously, our tax rate, we are planning for a step up in tax that we've absorbed in our guidance. But I think more to come on Pillar 2, we'll see how this plays out for us. So we have time on that one. The FX. So again, you have a combination of - when every currency moves, so quickly in such a short period of time by a high degree. And I'd mentioned these examples of where you have pure sourcing locations, Think of them as basically a cost center. Mexico is a good example where actually the peso strengthened against the dollar, you end up with cost dynamics that are also going to rollway. So literally, every currency went the wrong way and you also have timing of how that FX flows through inventory and started last year. So it does create this disconnect that we have. It does normalize over time within our portfolio. And certainly, by the time we get out of Q1, you'll see a more normal drop-through on FX. I'll turn it over to Tom on China, just one high-level comment because remember last year, we did have a comp from the recovery. So if you look at the 2-year growth it's more normalized closer to that double-digit range. With that said, we have contemplated some of the headwinds we're seeing in terms of the market dynamics playing out there. But I think the Q4 result was also impacted by the comparison to last year.\nTom Polen: And specifically on China, I'd really focus on 2 key areas. One is VOBP and then the topic related to farm systems, which Chris mentioned, which obviously we overcame at a global level, but you see it acute the topic within China, and we ended up reallocating the supply to other customers that were outside of China. So on the farm systems, one is, as Chris mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're just seeing specifically within China, basically a slowdown in exports of pharmaceutical products, specifically anticoagulants from China and so lower demand as those companies are seeing significant drops in their exports. So that's really one again, that ended up showing up in our - it will show up in our China numbers as a decline, but that same volume that would have gone to them gets reallocated to other customers globally who are - still have that business in their prefilled syringes for anticoagulants. And so we make - we didn't see it at a pharmaceutical systems level. So that's one and was notable within the quarter. I think the other one is really more VP - and again, primarily focused within the MDS business. We continue to see strong high single-digit, double-digit growth -- strong double-digit growth in Interventional and high in life sciences. So really, they continue at our historically expected growth rates, not only in '23, but through as we look ahead towards '24, that's our outlook there as well. It's really acute within specifically the MDS business and then the continuation, annualization of what we're seeing in China anticoagulants and exports So when it comes to anticorruption campaign, that's obviously a macro topic. We feel very strong about our compliance system, et cetera, nothing we're worried about. I think we saw some stabilization in the market on that versus maybe when it first came out in customers' reactions, but I wouldn't overly attribute it to that topic as much as the other 2 that I mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I'll ask the Alaris question. Are you still penciling in $200 million for the full year? And any help on maybe what you've expected in kind of Q1 just to help with the ramp for Aleris? And is that -- when you think about margins, is that one of the drivers of the second half margin ramp?\nTom Polen: Yes. It's - I'll start and then turn it over to Mike, just maybe start with the margin ramp. It's not a part of the margin ramp. It's not accretive to BDX margin. I think we've shared that in the past the capital itself is not. Obviously, the consumables associated with that tend to be, but not the capital itself. As we think about the $200 million, and then I'll turn it to Mike to just share some broader context. Again, at this point, we're a little over 90 days in. We're making solid progress we're at or ahead of our expectations there. But again, as we said, it's typically 3, 6 months - it's a 3-plus month process once you get a purchase order to get the installs, but then it's even - it's more like a 6-month plus sales process, which we started 90 days ago, right? And so some we are getting in earlier. We're getting contracts signed. We've already started shipments. But what we'll do is we'll continue to share our progress on that. We're not changing the 200 number now. And I think that was also -- just keep in mind that was something that we shared to give some color as related to clearance, but for competitive reasons, I wouldn't expect that we'll share a specific revenue number for Aleris going forward, just like we don't for any other product line. But we will make sure that we share color on our progress in terms of where we are relative to that absolute number. So maybe, Mike, other things to add.\nMike Garrison: Just really pleased that we were able to manufacture and ship product to the first customers ahead of schedule. We have been sort of planning for that more in Q1 of this year, but the team was able to execute to be able to ship products in end of September. And overall, I think that our discussions with the customers are going well, and we're able to start to line up for focusing on our existing customers for remediation out in the field. The other point that I would make is that we continue to sort of make solid progress just working with the customers. And we've mentioned before how important interoperability was during COVID. And certainly, for a lot of our customers, that's a key consideration in the discussions that we're having with them. So that's good for health care. I think that's good for public health. And so we're really happy that that's a key consideration from their perspective. And we're well positioned in that area.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Great. So with all the swing in FX and dominating the questions around the guide here. I have one sort of follow-up on that and then a follow-up on your growth and sort of growth priorities and other sort of investment provides you're making during the year, but out FX, the swing obviously is expecting everybody and we're starting to get a sense of that into year-end and early next year. But if you could maybe highlight the way that, that is managed through your P&L, how it at all there's any...\nTom Polen: Hey, Matt [indiscernible] there are slightly different than other folks in the space decisions that you make or make in terms of managing FX. And as I said, one follow-up.\nMatt Miksic: That\u2019s the first question.\nTom Polen: Yes. Matt, so a couple of things. I mean, I think no different from anyway. There's many ways that we mitigate currency dynamics, right? One, we netting where you have crossed currencies. Two is we actually try and match sourcing location-wise, to look at our manufacturing footprint. With that -- and there's hedging that we do, of course, in particular, to preserve cash is the way we think of it, right, like anything translational has no impact to underlying economic value of the currency in the local market. It always really becomes a strategy of how do you match sources and uses of cash. And so those become some of our principles when we think of FX. At the end of the day, what we can control is the underlying business, and that's what we presented here was an extremely strong top line growth, again, another year of margin improvement despite FX, by the way, right, 75 basis points of an FX headwind on margin. So we've committed to the at least 50 basis points. So it's really north of 100 when you think of it that way. And then again, we're being super focused on cash, which is the ultimate thing that creates value. And we expect to have double-digit free cash flow year-over-year. What was the -- was there another part of the question?\nMatt Miksic: Yes. And that's kind of actually dovetails nicely into the part 2, which is -- so you're making some choices that are impacting the margins as you talked about inventory takedowns, which are -- have an absorption effect, which I think everyone would agree is those are solid fundamental cash-generative decisions. And just with the questions as I think everyone is seeing there will be some -- there is some pressure here before the open, and it kind of gives the impression of a company that is under some pressure or defensive posture, but your actions obviously are saying the opposite. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of your continued efforts to either invest inorganically or highlight some of the drivers that you think are going to be significant growth leaders in the early and mid part of the year in 2024.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, Matt, and Tom can expand on this, too, maybe on how we're thinking of tuck-in M&A. But to your point, throughout this time frame, in addition to navigating significant complexity, absorbing outsized inflation, we've actually been leaning in and making bold choices that are paying off on growth and creating kind of a virtual cycle of strong growth. Margin improvement. So inventory is an example, it's an intentional added sort of pressure that we're putting on ourselves in terms of absorption because we know it actually creates net positive from a cash flow standpoint and yet we're absorbing that because we know we have a strong portfolio of cost to win programs like recode, et cetera. So we're doing that from a position of strength and actually you should view that as a sign of confidence, especially in a high interest rate environment, right? Cash is worth a lot more. We're also setting ourselves up from a tuck-in M&A, right? We've talked about the ability to execute against larger tuck-in size deals. Our net leverage is down to 2.6 times. We built strong cash throughout this year. So we feel really well positioned from that standpoint, and we'll continue to be disciplined, but strike on opportunities as they become available.\nTom Polen: And Matt, I think, as Chris said, we just set the inventory piece aside, create awareness in that, but it's really irrelevant at the end of the day in terms of we're delivering right our 6% top line organic growth, and we're delivering double-digit EPS growth organic, and then it's really FX is what gets flowed through, right? We're not going to cut R&D or cut other investments that we're making to drive our strong growth profile, which is a 7% CAGR over the last couple of years. We're not going to cut that to do FX when - particularly when we look at the cash flow, which is what we use to invest behind that growth has 0 impact from FX really that we see. We're continuing to drive actually outsized free cash flow. Think about in FY '23, we grew free cash flow by $600 million in the year, right? That's strong free cash flow growth, and we expect continued strong growth as we look at '24 and beyond. So I think in terms of we are extremely excited by our portfolio and what we have today. And I think you're seeing outsized performance across our different segments. I mean, if you look at BD Interventional, the strong growth in surgery with our bioabsorbable materials really taking off, and you can see there's been several quarters of strong growth there. PI doing well and obviously, PureWick now with the mail product. You heard us in our prepared remarks actually say that's going to be a bigger product than we thought it was going to be. When we originally put out our guide and declared which products were going to be over $50 million, we just increased PureWick mail to be one of those products that's going to be over $50 million, quite clearly. It's on one of the fastest ramps of any product we've ever seen at the company is doing extremely well, and we're adding capacity as fast as we can, really strong adoption by nurses in particular. In our Life Science business, great growth in Biosciences, I think you're seeing us be a standout within maybe peers in that area. The strength of our fax Discover platform, combined with our dies has done really well. You saw that continue through Q4, and we expect continued strong growth. We see strong demand for that platform and our combination with the unique dies to allow really another level of multiplex testing as well as whole new insights into the cells that you can now visually see in addition to fluorescence. Obviously, when it comes to bid Medical that bold investment that we made in capacity right in the middle of COVID, we're seeing pay off with another just very strong performance in farm systems, and we see just the durable trends there, whether or not it's the GLP-1s, other biologics that we're very well positioned from not only a portfolio offering and technology perspective, but from a capacity perspective, because of those bold investments, we're well positioned to continue to capitalize on those. And of course, in MMS, what we've built now with a $700 million pharmacy robotics business. Really, if you look across med tech, it's hard to name many automation or robotics businesses larger than our franchise that we've now built there in the pharmacy. And that's growing strong double digits. We expect that could continue through '24. And obviously, the return of Alaris has been our number one goal here for a couple of years, and we couldn't be more pleased to achieve that goal at the end of '23, and that gives us another talent and confidence in our long-term plan and our confidence in this year. So a lot of really good things happening. As we think about M&A, you did ask that question. As Chris also mentioned, we ended '23 at strong leverage, 2.6 times leverage, strong - strong cash flow, increasingly strong cash flow as we go into '24. And so we have a strong, robust M&A pipeline. We're still focused on larger-sized tuck-in M&A, which is still our priority, as we've shared, and we're not changing from that. We're going to continue to be very disciplined on the targets that we go after as we have been to make sure that they drive accretive growth and profitability for the company, and we see a number of opportunities to do that. And so - and I think you - we're really pleased with how we've executed on the M&A that we've done. We're really pleased with the track record that we've built there. You can see, as Chris shared, 40 basis points of underlying organic growth driven through the acquisitions that we've done over the last couple of years. And that's a lever we're going to continue to pull in a very systematic way. And I think you're seeing all the other actions that we're taking, including optimizing cash flow fit into that growth algorithm. So thank you for the question.\nMatt Miksic: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. All right. This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our call. So I would like to turn the floor back over to the speakers for any closing or additional remarks.\nTom Polen: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. I'd like to take a moment and again, thank our global team of BD Associates who are advancing our strategy and who are making meaningful impacts for our customers and the patients we mutually serve. Our BD 2025 strategy is demonstrating strong momentum. We're exceeding our commitments and have outlined a strong outlook for fiscal 2024. We look forward to connecting with everyone again on our next call, and thank you very much, and have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the audio webcast. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.+",

            "content": "Just really pleased that we were able to manufacture and ship product to the first customers ahead of schedule. We have been sort of planning for that more in Q1 of this year, but the team was able to execute to be able to ship products in end of September. And overall, I think that our discussions with the customers are going well, and we're able to start to line up for focusing on our existing customers for remediation out in the field. The other point that I would make is that we continue to sort of make solid progress just working with the customers. And we've mentioned before how important interoperability was during COVID.

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported our results for the fourth quarter and full year of FY '23, a year characterized by strong differentiated performance driven by our BD 2025 strategy in action, impactful new innovations and our diversified business portfolio designed to help our customers navigate today's challenging environment. The diversification of our portfolio offers both durability through our leading positions and consistent demand for products essential to everyday patient care and strong growth through a purposeful shift into higher growth markets, anchored against three irreversible forces we see shaping health care, connected care, new care settings and chronic disease. Additionally, we have built capabilities and fostered a culture of operational excellence, where we make disciplined and strategic capital allocation choices, proactively address macro headwinds through our simplification programs and execute with speed and agility, all of which have and continue to play a key role in delivering strong consistent performance. This unique profile can be seen in both our current and 2-year performance and where our purposeful shift into higher growth markets has enabled us to drive the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile. In FY '23, we delivered 7% base revenue growth with base organic growth of 5.8%. Our team drove significant margin expansion and delivered $12.21 in adjusted EPS, which represents double-digit currency-neutral growth of 11%. Over the past 2 years, we have made excellent progress toward our BD 2025 financial targets, delivering a 7% base organic revenue CAGR and 390 basis points of operating margin expansion. We are now over 70% of the wave 2 and tracking ahead of our 25% adjusted operating margin target by FY '25. As a result, on the bottom line, we delivered an implied base EPS CAGR of 20% currency neutral. We also ended FY '23 with strong execution of our strategic priorities. First, we delivered our number one priority, obtaining FDA clearance for the updated BD Alaris [ph] infusion system. Post clearance, our priority remains remediation, scaling up manufacturing and engaging with customers on the many benefits of the updated system that include advanced cybersecurity, wireless connectivity and other clinical and patient safety upgrades. We are confident in our remediation plan and have begun the process, prioritizing our existing customers. We are making good progress with active contracting and shipments of our first units to customers taking place ahead of schedule at the end of September. We are excited to deliver the benefits of the updated Alaris system to our customers and their patients, including the power of one integrated infusion platform with a centralized user interface for all major types of infusion as well as the value added through interoperability and other innovations that connect data from Alaris, Pyxis and the rest of our medication management offering into the industry's only end-to-end solution for safer, simpler and smarter medication management from the pharmacy to the floor, to the bedside. The clearance of the BD Alaris infusion system gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets. Second, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 27 key new products that benefit researchers, providers and patients, integrating AI, robotics and other advanced technologies. Our products are helping researchers gain deeper insights faster, like our fax Discover S8 cell sorter with CellView image technology and facts to at premium sample preparation system, which apply novel technologies like high-speed cell imaging and liquid handling robotics and our BD Horizon real yellow and real blue reagents, which were developed using AI guidance. Our pharmacy automation business continues to grow double digits and it's helping our customers serve patients more efficiently and with fewer errors across various care settings. Our robotic microbiology platform, BD Kiestra, hit record sales this year, and we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in our BD COR and BD MAX molecular platforms, leveraging our growing installed base through menu expansion that includes our new Vaginal Panel and our Onclarity HPV assay for thin prep on BD core and now greater than 20 assays on BD MAX. We continue to enable the care shift in new settings, including at home, through innovations such as our PureWick system franchise for urinary incontinence that we expanded to include solutions for male patients. PureWick Mail has been one of the fastest ramps of a new product in our history and continues to exceed our expectations. Given the strong adoption, we have now designated this as a greater than $50 million incremental growth opportunity. Pharmaceutical Systems, which achieved 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, continues to empower the delivery of new biologics, many administered by patients at home, such as the growing drug class of GLP-1s for diabetes and weight loss and other molecules, which will be delivered through our self-injection solutions. We are playing an increasing role in addressing chronic diseases like peripheral arterial disease and improving outcomes in tissue reconstruction. This year, we expanded the impact of new products such as our Rotarex Atherectomy system, Venous Stent System and then close RF ablation catheter, helping to address an area of high unmet need for the 10 million patients each year who are suffering from venous disease. In surgery, our teams accelerated the growth of Phasix Mesh to allow more patients to benefit from tissue repair performed with our resorbable synthetic biomaterial. And of course, we continue to drive a relentless focus on improving clinician and patient satisfaction with PIVO Pro and BD Nexiva with near Port IV access, a core element of our OneStick hospital stay vision that enables needleless blood draws, which is a major satisfaction for patients. And BD Pyxis ES 1.7.4, which now fully integrates our C2 Safe system into the Pyxis ES platform, enabling security and automated controlled substance management for pharmacists. I'm really pleased with how our R&D team executed in FY '23, again reaching a new record level of on-time milestones and launches. Our enhanced focus on programs with the potential to move the needle in terms of growth has positioned us well to drive our WAMGR expansion. We are on track to both achieve our target of over 100 new product launches by FY '25 and our new product revenue contribution target as outlined at Investor Day, creating a new wave of margin accretive growth for BD. Third, in addition to our investments in R&D, our tuck-in M&A strategy has been very impactful, targeted in higher-growth markets, M&A is complementing the plus side of our 5.5% plus growth profile and also contributing to growth on an organic basis as we anniversary those assets. This includes our acquisition of Parata Systems, which is part of our pharmacy automation business that is growing double digits. At nearly $700 million in revenue, BD Pharmacy Automation is one of the largest robotics and health care process automation businesses in med tech, focused on improving pharmacy labor efficiency and reducing errors. There's never been a greater need for these solutions. Fourth, we continued our simplification initiatives in FY '23 and actively managed our portfolio, divesting our surgical instrumentation business and executing a program of strategic portfolio exits, allowing us to continue to reallocate our resources into more strategic, higher growth areas and further reduce complexity across our company. We also progressed our project Reco network [ph] and SKU rationalization programs, exiting more than 2,300 incremental SKUs in FY '23 and are pleased that we have now streamlined our portfolio by 20% compared to 2019, achieving our goal laid out at Investor Day 2 years early. We are seeing the benefits in our manufacturing plants and in our simplified portfolio with customers. We will continue to advance this initiative as we keep executing BD 2025. In addition, we initiated our operating model simplification initiative to reduce our organizational complexity and increase agility. As a result, we were able to absorb continued outsized inflation during the year as planned and advanced operating margins towards our 25% target. And lastly, we strengthened our balance sheet, inclusive of executing on our planned inventory reductions and maintaining a disciplined and balanced capital deployment framework. This allows us to support organic and inorganic investments in growth while returning capital to shareholders. We just announced our 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. Lastly, I'm also very pleased with how we've advanced our ESG strategy and goals. In July, we published our 2022 ESG report, which provides details about our strategy and progress against our 2030 plus commitments. Highlights include progress in health equity and diversity as well as improving our environmental footprint, which included a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 10% and having generated 34% of our electric power from renewable energy. In FY '23, we submitted our GHG emission reduction targets to the science-based target initiative for verification. I'm quite excited by our innovative circular economy pilots we did this past year. They were the first of their kind in our industry. Recycling medical waste like use syringes and vacutainers and converting these materials back into usable resins. We'll be advancing this work further in FY '24 as we continue to tackle end-of-life GHG emissions and seek to lead circular economy innovation within our industry. We also continue to pioneer products and solutions that address health and equities, like our efforts to detect HPV infections and diagnose cervical cancer through at-home sample collection. We're proud that our progress continues to be recognized externally with BD most recently named among the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL and among the top 2 in the health care equipment and services industry. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD2025 as we look forward to FY '24. Starting with the macro environment. The complexity facing all companies will likely persist and in some cases, is accelerating. With China responding to economic pressures and elevated levels of geopolitical uncertainty occurring in multiple markets. Inflation has moderated from the peak high levels overall, but remains elevated compared to prepandemic norms, including higher labor rates in transportation and manufacturing, higher cost of energy and certain raw materials. While there continues to be a heightened degree of macro uncertainty as we head into FY '24, consistent with what we have done in the past several years, we have positioned BD to deliver strong performance through this environment. As we move forward, you can expect to see continued execution of VD2025 with a focus on the bold actions that position BD strategically for the future. These include continuing to advance our strong organic portfolio of programs in higher-growth spaces that are transforming health care. This includes launching another 25 key new products, including our Phase 6 ST umbilical product that will provide patients a reliable alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of our bioresorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. The BD multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy device, which is expected to be the first VAB system designed to work across all 3 imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI allows our customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training. Our next-generation PureWick incontinence solution for the hospital and the home will be launching in FY '24. And our FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter 3 and 4 laser configuration that will expand our new-to-world cell sorting instrument to the mid-parameter segment to help more researchers drive new discoveries. We're also launching our Libertas 5 ML device that will provide a wearable option for higher viscous drugs that tend to require longer dosing times. And finally, our BD next-generation infusion pump for Europe. These are just a few examples of the 25 key new product launches planned for FY '24. We will also continue to simplify our organization this year to enable operational excellence and agility, fuel investment and deliver on initiatives that will help us achieve our 25% adjusted operating margin goal in FY '25. this includes our Project Recode initiatives where our network optimization efforts will start Generating savings in FY '24 as we drive plant efficiencies and our operating model efforts where we are seeing positive early results from outsourcing certain back-office functions. As we accelerate our focus on BD Excellence, our unique business performance system, we will increase the adoption of lean principles beyond manufacturing with pilots outside of operations this year. I see our BD excellence system as an important new lever we're building as we look ahead and think about our strategic plans beyond BD 2025. And lastly, we expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. This includes ongoing transformation of our portfolio by deploying capital towards larger tuck-in acquisitions and in higher growth categories that we can scale and leverage to support our growth and margin goals. As I said at the top of the call, in fiscal 2023, our teams demonstrated exceptional agility and strong execution, advancing our BD 2025 strategy. We are delivering consistent durable performance in a challenging environment, which we expect to persist for several years to come. Our continued track record, combined with our growing pipeline and shift into higher growth markets is propelling us into a more innovative leader that is making a profound impact on advancing health care globally. We are advancing into FY '24 with clarity, focus and a growth mindset as we seek to do great things for those who rely on us, our customers, patients, associates and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Robbie, thanks for the question. First of all, our guide range obviously reflects - we basically try and match the top line. So if you look at the top line, you've got about 1 point on the range in total. I mean you dollarize that, take the dollar of sales take margin drop-through on that. It basically mirrors kind of the number of earnings that you have on either side. So there's symmetry between the sales, the drop through at some margin level that's between, call it, GP and EPS. So it contemplates both upside on sales and reinvesting back in the business or vice versa on the downside, basically the opposite. So I mean that's the logic for the range. I think it's pretty consistent with - it modifies year-over-year depending on how you actually set those points and what each point is worth I think more importantly, look, our commitments, we can't control currency, first of all. So we always think of things on an FXN basis. If you look at our FY '24 guide this year, I think there's a lot of strong things. The underlying performance of the business is really strong. Let's start with the top line. So if you remember, last quarter, we talked about delivering 6% organic growth. That was excluding the impact of the COVID-only testing, which we expect to step down by about 25 basis points. That would establish a midpoint range of, call it, 5.75%, which is very strong. It's above our 5.5% plus average. Our 2-year average heading into this year, plus this year at the midpoint would imply a CAGR of just under 7% organic growth. When you think about from the time that we mentioned kind of the direction we were heading 3 months ago to where we are now, looking at the top line, the macro environment certainly got more complex. I think for us, China was one of the dynamics that we called out, there's about a 75 basis point headwind that we're contemplating in our guide that's actually absorbed in that growth rate. So it actually implies excluding that organic growth of north of 6%. So really strong to be able to absorb that. I think this shows the resiliency of the BD portfolio, the diversified nature and all the work that we're doing to drive growth in these transformative spaces. We've talked about 6 key areas that as we think of our guide, kicking both, one, they're helping deliver the midpoint there and can create opportunity for upside. So that's farm systems. That's our MMS portfolio, including pharmacy automation on the back of Parada, our Rowa business, infusion, obviously, with the clearance of Alaris now, our bioscience research, peripheral vascular disease, molecular diagnostics and urinary incontinence. From an earnings standpoint, again, on an FXN basis, it's extremely consistent with what we shared last quarter. There's a couple of small puts and takes in here, but basically excluding our divestiture of eMeler [ph] we're anchored right at double-digit growth at the midpoint. At the top end, we're actually 11%, excluding the eMeler divestiture. So even with that divestiture, we have double-digit EPS growth in the top end of our earnings range. Again, there's 2 things that I would say that are different from last time. That includes us again absorbing the China headwind, which actually comes with some pricing dynamics. So really think of stronger underlying earnings to offset and absorb that. Plus, we've been very focused on cash. So with our strong margin profile, we made an intentional decision to continue to drive inventory levels down, especially in an environment where you have cash earning at high interest, it creates an opportunity and you have inflation flowing through inventory, keeping your inventory levels lower, create strong value creation. That creates a 50 basis point headwind through the year on margin, but that's an intentional choice and we're doing that because we have a strong cost to win program, leverage on our top line growth that we've consistently been driving and we can still drive towards our 25% goal by 2025. I think that focus on cash, one thing that even despite the FX, remember, FX, we don't control FX, I think a couple of the dynamics to think about, we literally had a 5% FX movement across our 5 major currencies since the last guide. It's unprecedented that they all go the same way. On top of that, we had a dynamic where some of our core, call it, expense-only sourcing locations, think of Mexico, where we have a huge manufacturing organization. We saw a 10% movement in that currency, where the peso actually strengthened against the dollar. We're not alone in this. Every company has been talking about it in Q4, adjusting their Q4. We're one of the first to report a full fiscal year. Many have signaled that, that will be coming in their results as well. The good news is one of the reasons that we focus on underlying is FX is not a true cash for cash impact. Some of this FX is pure translational. It does not affect our underlying cash. As a matter of fact, when you think of the cash flow for BD that we're thinking of in 2024 because of that strong FXN earnings growth profile on the back of strong top line growth and the continued cash conversion that we want to improve, we're going to drive double-digit cash flow from a free cash flow standpoint. So ultimate value creation happens with cash, and it's one of our core focus areas going forward. So I think FY '24, again, it's actually outsized versus our top line commitments that we've made as part of our Investor Day. We continue to drive margin improvement. We continue to deliver double-digit FX and earnings growth, and we actually have outsized cash flow growth - the FX is unfortunate, it's unprecedented. We don't control that. I think we're focused on continuing to drive long-term value. It would actually be value destructive to take outsized actions and try and cover that. So hopefully, that context all helps. Ravi, this is Tom. Just to add to Chris's excellent summary there, just to call out, we feel great about the performance in FY '23 as well as our outlook for '24. And just to give a little bit more detail on that inventory number. So in Q3, you saw meaningful improvements in our cash flow, including a $200 million reduction in inventory. In Q4, if you haven't seen yet, it's a $300 million reduction in our inventory in Q4 that we just achieved. Obviously, that - the inventory reduces within that quarter, the variance is then from producing less inventory from manufacturing, caps and rolls into the first half of next year. And so just to put it in perspective the scale that we've been taking inventory down at. And obviously, that has a meaningful benefit to cash flow and why we see such strong cash flow, growing nice double digits next year all in, which is really enables our continued strategy on our tuck-in M&A strategy, investing behind growth, right, continuing to drive the flywheel. Thanks again for the question. Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay and Chris will take that. And Vijay, just to add on. Obviously, with Aleris, we've always said, of course, typically from when we start booking installations, then we get contracts into 3 to 6 months from then that we actually start doing the installations, et cetera. And obviously, we started just a little over 90 days ago, engaging with customers. And so we're really pleased. We're making solid progress with Alaris, very constructive discussions. We started shipping. We've gotten our first contracts in place, but those will just take time to move through and therefore, we see the bigger ramp in the back half of the year. That's natural for that selling cycle. The other thing is, as Chris mentioned, we've made some assumptions for Q1 on respiratory testing and COVID levels being notably lower than last year. Obviously, that's to be determined. That could be an opportunity there depending on how the respiratory season plays out. Yes. You're talking specifically about Q1? Yes. So again, I mean, Q1 has - there's really 2 onetime dynamics in there. You have FX that's 200 basis points and you have the inventory take down, right? So the onetime impact of taking on increased absorption in your cost base, it's 400 basis points, all happening in Q1 that basically goes away. The FX becomes much smaller and more normalized throughout the year. The inventory is predominantly done in Q1. That goes away. You also have the outsized inflation that on average through the year is 100 basis points, but Q1 is more elevated because you have a carryover effect from last year. It's about 175 basis points. The good news again is we have really strong underlying cost improvements. I mean, at this point, Recode, which is supposed to deliver about $300 million savings as we enter into FY '20, 25. We're achieving about two thirds to 70% of that savings in this year. So we've made significant progress. We've actually fully completed the SKU rationalization program in terms of simplifying our SKU portfolio. We're not stopping there. We're going to actually increase that goal. There's more opportunity to go. So you have kind of 2 discrete onetime items in Q1, but the underlying and cost improvement are driving. We just need to maintain that throughout the year, and we'll be fine. Similar to what I shared before on Robbie's question was, last year, we had to deliver 200 basis points of margin improvement, a little bit north of that in the back half. We have to do the same thing this year. But last year, there was 200 basis points of outsized inflation. This year, there's half of outsized inflation. So we actually feel really strong. That's what's afforded us the opportunity to actually look at our inventory harder and maybe take some more aggressive goals, driving that down and driving improved cash. Again, FY '24 year that's going to have double-digit free cash flow growth year-over-year. And specifically on China, I'd really focus on 2 key areas. One is VOBP and then the topic related to farm systems, which Chris mentioned, which obviously we overcame at a global level, but you see it acute the topic within China, and we ended up reallocating the supply to other customers that were outside of China. So on the farm systems, one is, as Chris mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're just seeing specifically within China, basically a slowdown in exports of pharmaceutical products, specifically anticoagulants from China and so lower demand as those companies are seeing significant drops in their exports. So that's really one again, that ended up showing up in our - it will show up in our China numbers as a decline, but that same volume that would have gone to them gets reallocated to other customers globally who are - still have that business in their prefilled syringes for anticoagulants. And so we make - we didn't see it at a pharmaceutical systems level. So that's one and was notable within the quarter. I think the other one is really more VP - and again, primarily focused within the MDS business. We continue to see strong high single-digit, double-digit growth -- strong double-digit growth in Interventional and high in life sciences. So really, they continue at our historically expected growth rates, not only in '23, but through as we look ahead towards '24, that's our outlook there as well. It's really acute within specifically the MDS business and then the continuation, annualization of what we're seeing in China anticoagulants and exports So when it comes to anticorruption campaign, that's obviously a macro topic. We feel very strong about our compliance system, et cetera, nothing we're worried about. I think we saw some stabilization in the market on that versus maybe when it first came out in customers' reactions, but I wouldn't overly attribute it to that topic as much as the other 2 that I mentioned. Yes. It's - I'll start and then turn it over to Mike, just maybe start with the margin ramp. It's not a part of the margin ramp. It's not accretive to BDX margin. I think we've shared that in the past the capital itself is not. Obviously, the consumables associated with that tend to be, but not the capital itself. As we think about the $200 million, and then I'll turn it to Mike to just share some broader context. Again, at this point, we're a little over 90 days in. We're making solid progress we're at or ahead of our expectations there. But again, as we said, it's typically 3, 6 months - it's a 3-plus month process once you get a purchase order to get the installs, but then it's even - it's more like a 6-month plus sales process, which we started 90 days ago, right? And so some we are getting in earlier. We're getting contracts signed. We've already started shipments. But what we'll do is we'll continue to share our progress on that. We're not changing the 200 number now. And I think that was also -- just keep in mind that was something that we shared to give some color as related to clearance, but for competitive reasons, I wouldn't expect that we'll share a specific revenue number for Aleris going forward, just like we don't for any other product line. But we will make sure that we share color on our progress in terms of where we are relative to that absolute number. So maybe, Mike, other things to add. Hey, Matt [indiscernible] there are slightly different than other folks in the space decisions that you make or make in terms of managing FX. And as I said, one follow-up. Yes. Matt, so a couple of things. I mean, I think no different from anyway. There's many ways that we mitigate currency dynamics, right? One, we netting where you have crossed currencies. Two is we actually try and match sourcing location-wise, to look at our manufacturing footprint. With that -- and there's hedging that we do, of course, in particular, to preserve cash is the way we think of it, right, like anything translational has no impact to underlying economic value of the currency in the local market. It always really becomes a strategy of how do you match sources and uses of cash. And so those become some of our principles when we think of FX. At the end of the day, what we can control is the underlying business, and that's what we presented here was an extremely strong top line growth, again, another year of margin improvement despite FX, by the way, right, 75 basis points of an FX headwind on margin. So we've committed to the at least 50 basis points. So it's really north of 100 when you think of it that way. And then again, we're being super focused on cash, which is the ultimate thing that creates value. And we expect to have double-digit free cash flow year-over-year. What was the -- was there another part of the question? And Matt, I think, as Chris said, we just set the inventory piece aside, create awareness in that, but it's really irrelevant at the end of the day in terms of we're delivering right our 6% top line organic growth, and we're delivering double-digit EPS growth organic, and then it's really FX is what gets flowed through, right? We're not going to cut R&D or cut other investments that we're making to drive our strong growth profile, which is a 7% CAGR over the last couple of years. We're not going to cut that to do FX when - particularly when we look at the cash flow, which is what we use to invest behind that growth has 0 impact from FX really that we see. We're continuing to drive actually outsized free cash flow. Think about in FY '23, we grew free cash flow by $600 million in the year, right? That's strong free cash flow growth, and we expect continued strong growth as we look at '24 and beyond. So I think in terms of we are extremely excited by our portfolio and what we have today. And I think you're seeing outsized performance across our different segments. I mean, if you look at BD Interventional, the strong growth in surgery with our bioabsorbable materials really taking off, and you can see there's been several quarters of strong growth there. PI doing well and obviously, PureWick now with the mail product. You heard us in our prepared remarks actually say that's going to be a bigger product than we thought it was going to be. When we originally put out our guide and declared which products were going to be over $50 million, we just increased PureWick mail to be one of those products that's going to be over $50 million, quite clearly. It's on one of the fastest ramps of any product we've ever seen at the company is doing extremely well, and we're adding capacity as fast as we can, really strong adoption by nurses in particular. In our Life Science business, great growth in Biosciences, I think you're seeing us be a standout within maybe peers in that area. The strength of our fax Discover platform, combined with our dies has done really well. You saw that continue through Q4, and we expect continued strong growth. We see strong demand for that platform and our combination with the unique dies to allow really another level of multiplex testing as well as whole new insights into the cells that you can now visually see in addition to fluorescence. Obviously, when it comes to bid Medical that bold investment that we made in capacity right in the middle of COVID, we're seeing pay off with another just very strong performance in farm systems, and we see just the durable trends there, whether or not it's the GLP-1s, other biologics that we're very well positioned from not only a portfolio offering and technology perspective, but from a capacity perspective, because of those bold investments, we're well positioned to continue to capitalize on those. And of course, in MMS, what we've built now with a $700 million pharmacy robotics business. Really, if you look across med tech, it's hard to name many automation or robotics businesses larger than our franchise that we've now built there in the pharmacy. And that's growing strong double digits. We expect that could continue through '24. And obviously, the return of Alaris has been our number one goal here for a couple of years, and we couldn't be more pleased to achieve that goal at the end of '23, and that gives us another talent and confidence in our long-term plan and our confidence in this year. So a lot of really good things happening. As we think about M&A, you did ask that question. As Chris also mentioned, we ended '23 at strong leverage, 2.6 times leverage, strong - strong cash flow, increasingly strong cash flow as we go into '24. And so we have a strong, robust M&A pipeline. We're still focused on larger-sized tuck-in M&A, which is still our priority, as we've shared, and we're not changing from that. We're going to continue to be very disciplined on the targets that we go after as we have been to make sure that they drive accretive growth and profitability for the company, and we see a number of opportunities to do that. And so - and I think you - we're really pleased with how we've executed on the M&A that we've done. We're really pleased with the track record that we've built there. You can see, as Chris shared, 40 basis points of underlying organic growth driven through the acquisitions that we've done over the last couple of years. And that's a lever we're going to continue to pull in a very systematic way. And I think you're seeing all the other actions that we're taking, including optimizing cash flow fit into that growth algorithm. So thank you for the question. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. I'd like to take a moment and again, thank our global team of BD Associates who are advancing our strategy and who are making meaningful impacts for our customers and the patients we mutually serve. Our BD 2025 strategy is demonstrating strong momentum. We're exceeding our commitments and have outlined a strong outlook for fiscal 2024. We look forward to connecting with everyone again on our next call, and thank you very much, and have a great rest of the day."

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. We delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year, which reflect the diversity of our portfolio and our BD 2025 strategy in action. Beginning with our revenue performance. We delivered $5.1 billion in revenue in Q4, exceeding our expectations with base organic growth of 7% and total base growth of 6.3%, which reflects the impact from the surgical instrumentation divestiture. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $19.4 billion in revenue with base organic revenue growth of 5.8% that is 100 basis points higher than our initial guidance. Total base revenue growth was 7%, driven by strong performance in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with high single-digit growth in EMEA and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. and Greater Asia despite low single-digit growth in China. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from higher-growth spaces that are driving the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 40 basis points for the full year. Over a 2-year period, we drove a strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 6.2% with strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems. BD Medical performance reflects a decline in medication delivery systems resulting from softness in China driven by market dynamics, including some impacts from volume-based procurement. This was partially offset by strong performance in catheter solutions in North America and Europe through continued execution of our vascular access management strategy. MMS delivered exceptional growth of 13.7%, driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and pharmacy automation as customers focus on solutions, which improve workflows and efficiencies and help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages. Pharmaceutical Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6% driven by continued strong demand for prefillable solutions for biologics, partially offset by a slowdown in China exports of anticoagulants. Ed Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 3.8%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Biosciences. Life Sciences base business growth reflects IDS base business growth of 0.6%, driven by continued adoption of our BD KIESTRA microbiology lab automation solution and strong IDAST instrument placements and continued growth of our molecular IVD assays, leveraging the BD core system and our expanded BD MAX installed base. Growth was partially offset by the comparison to prior year COVID-related recovery in China and a decline in specimen management that was driven by distributor and customer stocking in the prior year. PDB [ph] grew 11.7%, driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD Fax Discover SH cell sorter that is enabling an entirely new level of biological depth of speed, ease of use and solution integration for researchers across fields like immunology, cancer research and cell biology. BDs performance also reflects strong growth in clinical reagents, leveraging our increasing installed base of FaxleRic [ph] analyzers in facto-ed automation. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 9.6% and 12.8% organic. The strong double-digit organic growth was driven by surgery growth of 5% or 15.5% organic, which excludes the impact from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation platform of 10.5 percentage points. Organic growth reflects strong market adoption of our leading Phasix Hardie products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. PI grew 11.7%, which reflects strong performance in peripheral vascular disease driven by global penetration of the rotor atherectomy system and our venous portfolio in China. Growth was aided by improved supply and distribution stabilization in EMEA following a new ERP implementation in fiscal '22. Urology grew 11.7%, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions in both the acute care and alternative care settings. Now moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.42 reflects strong double-digit growth of 24% or 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 52.6%, and as anticipated, we delivered very strong margin improvement with adjusted operating margin of 25.4%, up 340 basis points. As expected, margin improvement was driven by leverage on our strong revenue performance, our ability to offset outsized inflation, lower SSG&A driven by our simplification initiatives, moderated R&D expense as a percent of sales due to investment timing and a favorable comparison to last year's COVID profit reinvestment. Full year adjusted diluted EPS of $12.21 grew 7.6% or 11% currency-neutral. This includes delivering an additional $0.14 of currency-neutral earnings versus our original guidance. Additionally, we absorbed almost 400 basis points associated with reduced COVID-only testing, implying base currency-neutral EPS growth of approximately 15%. For the full year, gross margin of 53.5% was flat to the prior year despite absorbing over 200 basis points of outsized inflation and cost of goods sold. Operating margin of 23.5% was up about 90 basis points or 110 basis points when excluding the 20 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item, exceeding our margin goal for the year. The employee benefit item is recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. While delivering our margin goals, we also maintained investment in R&D at 6% of sales or about $1.2 billion to advance our pipeline of innovation programs that will support our strong growth profile in fiscal year '24 and beyond. As anticipated, we made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals. Our FY '23 adjusted operating margin is ahead of our 2019 spin adjusted margin, which is particularly significant given it includes overcoming 500 basis points or almost $1 billion of outsized inflation in the past 3 years. Over the next 2 years, we remain well positioned to return to our targeted 25% operating margins. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $3 billion in FY '23. As expected, cash flow accelerated over the back half of the year and was strongest in Q4 due to normalization of working capital, including continued moderation of our inventory balances. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and as anticipated, delivered a step-up in FY '23 with free cash flow increasing by over $600 million. We are planning another step improvement in FY '24 and expect free cash flow to increase double digits. This will be achieved through further moderation of inventory levels by the end of the year and continued discipline around CapEx investments through focused prioritization and areas of targeted reduction, both of which we expect to more than offset cash investments to support the Alaris remediation. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%. Beyond our investments in growth, we paid down over $700 million in debt this fiscal year and returned $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.4 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.6 times This is our strongest net leverage position since FY '21, which positions us well to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our investment in higher-growth categories through our tuck-in M&A strategy. Moving to our guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. As demonstrated by our results over the past 2 years, BD has the ability to deliver strong performance in the most challenging times. Our performance reflects strong execution of our BD 2025 strategy, the benefit of our diversified and durable portfolio or simplification and outsized cost improvement programs and bold, purposeful capital allocation and investment decisions, all further optimized by our ability to execute with agility. As we look to fiscal '24, while the macro landscape has evolved since our last earnings call, I'm pleased to share we remain committed to the revenue growth profile we previously outlined. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver another year of organic growth above our 5.5% plus profile. Let me share some of the key puts and takes contemplated in our guidance. First, we see strong momentum in many parts of our business. We have 6 key areas in our portfolio now totaling over $5 billion or 25% of our sales that we expect to deliver high single to double-digit growth. These include our farm systems pre-fillable syringes, which are benefiting from the strong trends in biologics, our bioscience business, our peripheral vascular disease platform, our medication management systems business, including pharmacy automation and infusion given the recent clear Delaris pump, urinary incontinence supported by our PureWick franchise; and finally, our molecular diagnostic platforms. This allows us to deliver strong results despite some heightened macro dynamics affecting many industries, most notably in China, along with increasing risk and complexity as the result of the war in the Middle East and other geographies. Specific to the health care industry, providers continue to feel the pressure of elevated inflation and labor dynamics. And while they remain very focused on cost and working capital management, our portfolio has proven to be more resilient in this type of environment given BD's essential role in the health care ecosystem and our ability to transform health care processes and drive efficiencies. As it relates to BD, the largest headwind we anticipate from these macro dynamics is in our China business, where we see market softness and increasing levels of volume-based procurement, predominantly impacting our MDS business along with some impact in farm systems from reduced demand as our Chinese pharmaceutical customers export business slow. As a result, we are projecting China to be flat to modest growth in FY '24, which creates nearly a 75 basis point headwind to our revenue growth this year. Taking these factors into account, we expect to deliver base organic growth of about 6% at the midpoint, which is consistent with the view we provided on our last earnings call. We still expect COVID-only testing to step down from the $73 million reported this year and result in a headwind to organic growth of over 25 basis points. This brings the midpoint of our total organic growth to 5.75% within our 5.25% to 6.25% range. To help simplify our reporting, unless there's a significant change in the COVID-only testing market. Effective this year, we will no longer be reporting base organic growth that excludes COVID-only testing. However, it was important to give us context with our initial guidance. As a reminder, while the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform that closed in Q4 FY '23 does not impact our organic growth, we'll have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total revenue growth in FY '24 and is accounted for in our total currency-neutral revenue growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%. Moving to margins and earnings. We plan to deliver another year of strong profitable growth, including progressing our adjusted operating margin towards our FY '25 goal of 25%, while generating cash flow improvements to support our strong and reliable growth profile. On gross margin, we expect to be about flat year-over-year on a reported basis, including the impact of currency headwinds of approximately 75 basis points. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect gross margin to improve with our simplification strategy more than offsetting 150 basis points of headwinds from outsized inflation of about 100 basis points and another 50 basis points from inventory reduction efforts that occurred in FY '23 and that we plan to further moderate down by the end of FY '24, which will improve cash flow. The value from our simplification programs continue to be driven by our recode network optimization, SKU rationalization and operating model simplification programs. Additionally, our BD excellence program, which focuses on the application of lean principles is driving productivity gains across our operations. As it pertains to OpEx, we anticipate SG&A expense leverage on strong revenue performance and continued benefit from our operating model simplification programs. After 3 consecutive years of investing in R&D at over 6% on average, in FY '24, we anticipate a consistent year-to-year dollar spend in R&D that is needed to advance our pipeline, which will result in some modest leverage. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin to improve by around 50 basis points on a reported basis over the 23.5% reported in FY '23, primarily driven by SSG&A leverage. This puts us well on track to achieve our 25% margin goal by FY '25. For tax, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13% and 15%. As a reminder, it would not be unusual for our tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Given all these considerations, we expect adjusted EPS growth before the impact of currency of 8.25% to 10.25% or 9.25% at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about a 75 basis point headwind from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation business, and as a result, implies double-digit earnings growth, excluding the divestiture of 10% at the midpoint and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance we provide perspective on currency using current spot rates, consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar, along with normal FX translation, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we also faced the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L, including the impact from the sourcing and timing of inventory production and movements throughout our network. Since our last call in August, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against most major currencies and the change over this time period accounts for nearly two thirds of the expected FX impact. Additionally, as it relates to sourcing from Mexico, where we have a large manufacturing footprint, the dollar weakened versus the peso by about 10%, taking the average rate over the last 4 months ending in October versus the average over the first 9 months of fiscal year '23, with the peso achieving peak rates that in that time frame had not been seen in well over 5 years. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency is estimated to be a headwind with approximately 75 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 375 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis. All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $20.1 billion to $20.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $12.70 to $13, which represents growth of 4% to 6.5%. As a reminder, currency can fluctuate over time, and it would not be prudent to deviate from our investment profile that is resulting in consistently strong base organic growth, which is delivering an expected 3-year base organic CAGR of about 6.8%, well above our 5.5% plus growth profile. We continue to deliver margin improvement, resulting in earnings growing 1.3x the rate of sales. And with our focus on improved cash conversion, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. As you think of fiscal '24 phasing, the following are considerations for Q1 in context on how revenue and margin will index through the remainder of the year. As it relates to Q1, we expect organic revenue growth to under index the full year by over 200 basis points, and we expect a decline in adjusted EPS versus the prior year of about $0.55 to $0.60. There are 3 key items to consider First, sales was driven by the prior year base and COVID-only respiratory testing comparison, along with the market dynamics in China. These impacts are about equally weighted and primarily impact the IDS and MDS business with a modest impact in farm systems associated with China. We also expect Alaris revenues to ramp over the year and be weighted to the second half. Second, we expect operating margin to decline by around 350 basis points on a reported basis in Q1 with 200 basis points driven by inventory-related FX dynamics and another 200 basis points from the negative absorption impact from our planned inventory reductions, which we expect to partially offset through our simplification and cost mitigation initiatives while also overcoming outsized inflation. Lastly, we had a discrete tax item in Q1 of last year that creates a negative comparison. As you think about the remainder of the year, we expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the ramp-up of Alaris. We expect our Q2 margins to expand significantly on a sequential basis, resulting in year-over-year operating margin being nearly flat on a reported basis or slightly up on a currency-neutral basis. In closing, we are very pleased with our performance this past year, particularly given our ability to navigate another year of significant macro complexity and inflationary pressure. The momentum in our durable and strong portfolio, along with our track record of successfully executing and delivering against our commitments, gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '24 and create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Let me take a moment to thank our talented employees across BD who through growth mindset and an unwavering commitment to our purpose or core to delivering this performance. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please? Yes. Great question. So first of all, 23, I mean, look, we delivered exactly against our commitments from the beginning of the year. As a matter of fact, we increased our organic growth by over 100 basis points from our original guide. We increased our earnings $0.14 on an FXN basis, taking out the currency noise, which actually was favorable as that we advanced through the year. Margin, we fully delivered. Remember, there's a small accounting adjustment from employee benefits that actually gets adjusted in another line item. We're actually over our commitment when you think of that. So we're really pleased with what we did on FY '23. I think the last I looked, there's maybe less than a handful of companies, 2 or 3 that are able to drive margin improvement from the start of this outsized inflation. So over the last 3 years, we've absorbed $1 billion of outsized inflation while improving our margin by almost 400 basis points. So really proud of the organization and strong commitment to executing against that. It's a great question on '24. I actually view '24 in some ways, dress. So here's the criteria as you think of '24. So one, we have another 100 basis points of outsized inflation. Most of that is in labor. There's some other input costs, some packaging fuel. We have 50 basis points that we've actually made the choice around this absorption from lowering our inventories to drive outside cash. So that's an intentional choice that's in our plan because we do have such a strong cost improvement program in place to offset those and still achieve our long-term margin goals. And then we have 75 basis points of FX. We're going to more than absorb that with 225 basis points of cost to win price mix in GP. So gross margin for the year will be about flat. And then we have about 50 basis points coming from SG&A leverage and some of the benefits from our operating model simplification plan. So that's kind of the full year dynamic. In the quarter, to your point, we talked about a 350 basis point headwind in the quarter. But you have 2 large onetime items. Almost all of the FX is indexed towards Q1 and almost 100% of that inventory choice is also happening in Q1. Those are about 200 basis points, respectively. The 100 basis points of outsized inflation is over-indexed in Q1 at about 175 basis points. What that implies is we're actually driving underlying about 225 to 250 basis points of cost improvement that are offsetting those items. The other thing to think of is if you look at last year as an analog and for 8 quarters now, we've been very predictive in what our margin would do quarter-over-quarter, and we fully executed against the commitments we've made externally. So one, there's credibility and that gives us confidence. But if you look at last year, we needed a little over 200 basis points on average in the back half. And as everyone knows, it was weighted towards Q4. This year, you'll see a little bit more balanced in the second half, but we do need another year of a little over 200 basis points of margin improvement in the second half. By Q2, we get back to flat. The good news is last year, we were absorbing 200 basis points of outsized inflation. This year, it's only 100 basis points of outsized inflation and a lot of that is happening in the front end, right? So the back end gets easier, and it's half of the challenge that we had last year when you think of outsized inflation. So it's the same amount of margin improvement we need in the back half with half of the outsized inflation in the back half. And given the fact that we're already delivering about 225 to 250 basis points of cost to win, pricing mix benefits in Q1. If that continues throughout the year, which we have strong plans that execute against that, we feel really confident with our margin goals for the year. Yes. Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. Yes. On sales, we indicated that our organic growth in Q1 was under-indexed by 200 basis points. There's really 2 factors, maybe 3. The key factors are, one, the respiratory testing dynamics, both in our base and the COVID only, which we're going to now just report as our base business, right? It was still more indexed in Q1 of last year. So as that normalizes year-over-year. The other one is some of the China slowdown that I noted, which is mostly in our medical business, we're still seeing strong performance, in particular, in BDI, which has been a source of strength for us. The good news is we've baked that into our planning by the time that we ramp up to the back of the year that normalizes throughout the year. So those are the 2 small items. The third one I would point to, of course, that we've articulated is the Alaris. As that comes back, we talked about that being a ramp throughout the year. So those are probably the key 3 considerations. To your point, I think especially on the back of absorbing 75 basis points of a China headwind in our growth rate, 5.75 really implies organic growth of 6% north. So it's just -- it's another year of really strong performance. I think it's -- when you think of BD, we're not dependent on one area of growth. I think that offers a source of confidence in complex times like this. And I think the growth is broad-based, right? We talked about the 6 key areas within our portfolio that offer opportunity to deliver that outsized growth of either high single digits to double digits. So we continue to focus on that, transforming our portfolio through organic investments in R&D and the tuck-in work we've done. If you noticed '23, the impact from our tuck-in acquisitions are now contributing 40 basis points to growth after having anniversaried them for 1 year. I mean there's - we can follow up. But there are timing on. If you remember last year, I mean, there are some timing dynamics you're going to see. R&D, you're going to see is much more normalized this year. That's one area I would point to. So I think you should expect to see OpEx actually down a little bit in the first half of the year, partially because of that when you're looking at pure SSG&A spend and R&D spend, and then that will renormalize in the back half of the year. We were very front-end loaded with R&D this year in '23. And then we moderated it back in the second half due to timing of programs, milestones and things like that. This year is more normalized, and we're going to spend about the same in R&D year-over-year from a dollar base. That's probably the one key thing I would point to. Yes. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate the question. Let me take the last 2 first, I guess. First of all, BD, we started our fiscal year before everyone else. So Pillar 2 is not contemplated more applicable to us in fiscal year '24. We continue to assess those dynamics. We expect a lot more information as this year progresses. We'll share more on that at a future date. Obviously, our tax rate, we are planning for a step up in tax that we've absorbed in our guidance. But I think more to come on Pillar 2, we'll see how this plays out for us. So we have time on that one. The FX. So again, you have a combination of - when every currency moves, so quickly in such a short period of time by a high degree. And I'd mentioned these examples of where you have pure sourcing locations, Think of them as basically a cost center. Mexico is a good example where actually the peso strengthened against the dollar, you end up with cost dynamics that are also going to rollway. So literally, every currency went the wrong way and you also have timing of how that FX flows through inventory and started last year. So it does create this disconnect that we have. It does normalize over time within our portfolio. And certainly, by the time we get out of Q1, you'll see a more normal drop-through on FX. I'll turn it over to Tom on China, just one high-level comment because remember last year, we did have a comp from the recovery. So if you look at the 2-year growth it's more normalized closer to that double-digit range. With that said, we have contemplated some of the headwinds we're seeing in terms of the market dynamics playing out there. But I think the Q4 result was also impacted by the comparison to last year. Yes, Matt, and Tom can expand on this, too, maybe on how we're thinking of tuck-in M&A. But to your point, throughout this time frame, in addition to navigating significant complexity, absorbing outsized inflation, we've actually been leaning in and making bold choices that are paying off on growth and creating kind of a virtual cycle of strong growth. Margin improvement. So inventory is an example, it's an intentional added sort of pressure that we're putting on ourselves in terms of absorption because we know it actually creates net positive from a cash flow standpoint and yet we're absorbing that because we know we have a strong portfolio of cost to win programs like recode, et cetera. So we're doing that from a position of strength and actually you should view that as a sign of confidence, especially in a high interest rate environment, right? Cash is worth a lot more. We're also setting ourselves up from a tuck-in M&A, right? We've talked about the ability to execute against larger tuck-in size deals. Our net leverage is down to 2.6 times. We built strong cash throughout this year. So we feel really well positioned from that standpoint, and we'll continue to be disciplined, but strike on opportunities as they become available."

With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of broad-based strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. Before we detail our quarterly performance, I want to highlight the 510(k) clearance we received on July 21 from the FDA for the updated BD Alaris Infusion System. This has been our number one priority since launching BD 2025, and we\u2019re pleased to deliver this important milestone. For more than 20 years, infusion pumps have represented the backbone of hospital operations. Over that time, Alaris was the first product that connected all patient modules into one integrated system and the first platform to introduce medication safety software, which led the way to interoperability with electronic medical records. And later with the launch of BD HealthSight, Alaris again led the way with integration into the full suite of BD end-to-end connected medication management solutions from the pharmacy to the administration of drugs at the patient\u2019s bedside. Today, the Alaris system continues to advance new levels of innovation with enhanced cybersecurity protection, the latest wireless capabilities and new features that enable various aspects of medication management and ultimately help clinicians deliver the best care. In short, we\u2019re proud of the Alaris Power of One that makes medication management safer, simpler and smarter. With this clearance, we address all open recalls with the latest hardware and a new version of software as well as provide important cybersecurity updates. We can now focus on bringing the updated system to the market, ensuring our installed base is upgraded so customers can realize the full benefits of our latest technology. As we return to market, we will start with upgrading or replacing the hardware and software of Alaris system devices in the U.S. market with priority towards our existing customers. Given the breadth of our footprint, this effort will happen over a multiyear period. Just two weeks into clearance, we are well prepared. We immediately took action have contacted nearly all of our customers. We activated a dedicated team with daily stand-ups and have completed product training for our service teams on the cleared Alaris system. As we previously shared, we are prepared for clearance and our return to market. We have invested in and developed plans for operational capacity, and we\u2019ve strengthened our supply chain. We have now activated those plans, which were dependent on clearance and are moving quickly to help ensure we can reliably supply our market-leading BD Alaris system and deliver for our customers. In parallel, we continue to engage with the FDA on how we intend to execute our remediation plans, which includes a combination of upgrades and replacements. We\u2019ll provide more information as we progress. Before I move on, I would like to thank our customers for their loyalty and patience as we work through this challenging period. Our teams are ready and committed to provide the high-quality service and partnership that you\u2019ve come to expect from us. And on behalf of the entire BD leadership team, I want to extend our deep appreciation to the BD associates who work tirelessly to bring the updated BD Alaris system to market for their ongoing commitment to quality and ensuring we achieve this milestone in the right way, in line with our values. We\u2019d also like to thank the FDA for their rigorous review and engagement as we went through the clearance process. Turning to our quarterly financial results. Our strategy and purposeful investments in innovation are driving consistent higher growth and fueling strong results and momentum. Our results are indicative of our leadership position in our durable core and intentional shifts towards higher growth end markets in a highly motivated and talented global team whose focus on execution is helping our customers provide more efficient and effective care. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results with 7.9% base revenue growth or 6.3% base organic and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Once again, our results reflect our strategy and action and our strong, consistent growth profile, which gives us the confidence to increase our FY 2023 organic growth rate. We also continue to make strong progress improving our on-time milestones and launches to another record level this year. Starting with a few examples of our recent launches. In our Medical segment, we introduced the BD Prevue II System, a first-to-world technology that magnetizes the tip of certain existing BD catheters and allows them to be seen under the preview ultrasound device. The software then guides clinicians to enter the vasculature with first stick success. This novel approach enables BD peripheral IVs to deliver new value to patients and providers. In our Biosciences business, we are seeing a super cycle of innovation this quarter with three key new product launches. In mid-May, we began shipping the BD FACSDiscover S8 cell sorter. Our customers are utilizing this new standard in flow cytometry to unlock life-changing discoveries across immunology, cancer research and cell biology by uncovering more detailed information about cells and how they interact that was previously invisible. The first installations are complete. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we are seeing strong demand. We also launched the BD Rhapsody HT Xpress, which enables access to the fast-growing single-cell multiomics market with a high throughput research solution. The HT Xpress can process up to 320,000 cells per run. Eightfold the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform, while leveraging Rhapsody\u2019s micro well designed to ensure high-quality results for all cell types. And most recently, we announced the launch of the BD FACSDuet Premium Sample Preparation System, a new robotic system to automate clinical flow cytometry enabling the only walk-away automation for both HIV and leukemia and lymphoma testing. And in our BDI segment, we launched the BD Trek Powered Bone Biopsy System, expanding our presence in oncology beyond the manual biopsy market. The BD Trek system allows for faster sampling with sizes to accommodate a variety of procedural needs. Our differentiated offering enables the ability to collect large intact samples while providing the clinical versatility to biopsy delicate areas that require precise targeting as well as bones that require power. We\u2019ve also achieved several crucial development milestones this quarter. These include 510(k) submission of the Site-Rite 9 Ultrasound System, which is part of our vascular access management strategy. The Site-Rite 9 was developed to be the first integrated system that combines catheter and ultrasound navigation into a single device to simplify workflow, capital management and training for clinicians for the placement of BD Pyxis. In our IDS business, we are expanding the strategy for our BD Onclarity HPV franchise to enable patients to self-collect samples with the aim to promote health care equity by making cervical cancer screening accessible to women who historically haven\u2019t participated or have had limited access to testing. This is already in use across Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. Clinical trials are set to start in India, Africa and the U.S. later this year. We are proud of this work and its ability to advance our efforts to reduce health care and equities around the world. And in our PI business, we submitted and received IDE approval for our TIPS-Venous Stent Graft and are on track to enroll the first patient in Q4. Used in the liver, this novel self-expanding covered stent continues to expand our leadership position and build on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients. These launches and milestones are good examples of accelerated levels of innovation across our business and how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. We continue to simplify our company through programs across our manufacturing network and operating model while actively managing our portfolio. As such, we recently completed the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. This value-creating transaction supports the achievement of our BD 2025 financial goals and further advances the BDI segment\u2019s focus on high-growth end markets. This divestiture allows us to focus BD surgery strategic investments In Advanced Repair and Reconstruction and surgical complications, which are driving results and helping to address unmet needs in healthcare. Proceeds from the sale strengthened our cash and net leverage position and support our tuck-in acquisition strategy. We also continue to make progress on our other simplification initiatives, including the reduction of 20% of our SKUs by FY 2025. Ongoing network architecture optimization and our operating model initiatives to transition certain BD shared service center activities to a third-party to optimize our back-office processes and services. Looking externally let me share some perspective on the macro environment. Overall, the macro environment is in line with our view that challenges will persist, not escalate. However, uncertainty remains. We continue to monitor various factors, including how health systems, governments, distributors and suppliers are managing inflation, inventory and other supply chain dynamics. Broadly speaking, inflation is moderating, but is still elevated. The supply chain has continued to stabilize, and we\u2019re very pleased with our progress to reduce back orders. We expect to exit the year at pre-pandemic levels, which is enabling us to shift our focus to reducing raw material and some finished goods inventory, which is contributing to our cash flow improvement. While overall procedure volumes are healthy, our portfolio has been more durable and less impacted by significant short-lived fluctuations in procedure volumes. Overall, the capabilities we have built and the durability of our portfolio have positioned us well. Before I turn it over to Chris, I\u2019d like to share an update on our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 15th annual ESG report that details our progress on the four pillars of our ESG strategy, company health, human health, community health and planet health. The FY 2022 report highlights our notable progress in energy and waste reduction, health care access and diversity. Key achievements include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 10% from an FY 2019 baseline, an increase in the number of locations using renewable energy, the establishment of product recycling pilots around the world and completion of our baseline assessment for Scope 3 emissions. The report also highlights our ongoing work in advancing health equity in under-resourced communities and the product solutions and programs we\u2019re investing in, that directly address these in equities. BD has always played a tremendous role in addressing health disparities and access to health care around the world, and we\u2019re proud of our continued focus in this area. We are also proud to receive continued recognition for our commitment to talent and creating an inclusive culture. Most recently, we were recognized as the best place to work for disability inclusion for the fifth consecutive year, achieving a top score on the Disability Equality Index and we were named to U.S. News & World Report\u2019s inaugural Best Companies to Work for list. In summary, we continue to deliver consistent strong results. Our teams are working unwaveringly to achieve key milestones that sets us up for continued growth and consistent performance. And this quarter is another reflection of our focus and determination in achieving our BD 2025 goals. We continue to grow, simplify and empower BD and evolve into an agile, innovative medical technology company with a durable compelling growth profile. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom\u2019s comments, our BD 2025 strategy is driving consistent performance in an outsized growth profile. We are advancing our innovation pipeline and delivering against our revenue, margin, and EPS goals. We\u2019re also making progress strengthening our balance sheet with lower inventory and net leverage, consistent with the commitments we made. With strong year-to-date results, we are well on track to achieve our updated FY 2023 guidance. And with the addition of Alaris return to market, we are increasingly confident in achieving our BD 2025 long-term targets of 5.5% plus organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Beginning with some color on our revenue performance. We delivered strong Q3 base revenue growth of 7.9% or 6.3% organic. Base organic growth includes growing over prior year respiratory testing sales which negatively impacted base growth by approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, our tuck-in acquisition strategy continues to enable profitable growth with organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried contributing about 40 basis points in the quarter and are expected to contribute 50 basis points for the full year. COVID-only testing revenues were $8 million in the quarter, which as expected, declined from $76 million last year. Revenue growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 8.1%, respectively. As expected, BD Life Sciences revenues declined due to lower COVID-only testing revenues compared to the prior year. Life Sciences base revenues, which exclude COVID-only testing, were about flat, given the comparison to prior year respiratory testing sales that negatively impacted base growth by about 400 basis points. On an underlying basis, Life Sciences base revenues grew approximately 4%. Total company base revenue growth was strong across all regions with high single-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally, including strong double-digit growth in China. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes an MDS where we continue to drive growth in Vascular Access Management with our BD PosiFlush vascular care and PIVC Catheter Solutions. In Medication Management Solutions, our investments in high-growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth, led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. Our MMS dispensing platform reported double-digit growth, reflecting our continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the BD HealthSight portfolio. And in Pharm Systems [ph], in the higher-growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market, our capacity expansion investments and strong leadership position in pre-fillable solutions with BD Hypak and newer innovations in products such as BD Neopak, BD Effivax and BD Hylok are driving our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while supporting the increased demand in high-growth categories like biologics. Life Sciences base business growth was about flat and approximately 4% underlying when adjusting for the respiratory testing sales comparison. This reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including microbiology, molecular diagnostics and single-cell analysis. It was partially offset by impact of some U.S. distributors destocking in specimen management. In our IDS business, double-digit growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution, including continued adoption of the IdentifA and Total Modular Track Solutions and strong demand for our blood culture and ID/AST reagents. Continued strong growth in molecular IVD assays reflects leverage of BD COR and the incremental BD MAX installed base. In Biosciences, high single-digit growth was driven by our clinical business with strong double-digit growth in cancer reagents, leveraging the growth in our installed base of FACSLyric analyzers and adoption of FACSDuet automation. Performance in Research Solutions reflects continued strong growth in research reagents enabled by our innovative BD Horizon dyes. Strong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including Advanced Repair and Reconstruction, PVD and incontinence, where our newer innovations in high-growth areas are continuing to contribute nicely to growth. Our Surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth driven by continued market adoption of Phasix\u2019s hernia resorbable scaffold and our PI business unit, double-digit growth in Peripheral Vascular Disease was driven by broad-based strength across the portfolio, including global penetration of Rotarex. In our UCC business unit, high single-digit growth was driven by strength across the portfolio, including strong double-digit growth of our PureWick solutions for addressing chronic incontinence in both the acute and alternate care settings and double-digit growth in Endourology. Further details regarding each segment\u2019s performance in the quarter can be found in today\u2019s earnings announcement and presentation. Now moving to our P&L. We reported Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.96, which included gross margin of 52.6% and operating margin of 23%. Operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year and includes an unfavorable 100 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item that gets recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. Excluding this item, operating [Technical Difficulty] and was ahead of our expectations driven by strong execution against our margin improvement initiatives. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point headwind to both gross margin and operating margin. Gross margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth and the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives that enabled us to overcome 200 basis points of outsized inflation. Our Q3 margin drivers are aligned with what we have been anticipating throughout the year, which is that most of the full year margin improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage. Q3 SSG&A expense increased about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 150 basis points of leverage in SSG&A, which reflects shipping efficiency and good leverage in selling and G&A expense. As expected, R&D as a percentage of sales of 5.9% and normalized back towards our expected full year average of about 6% in Q3, given our spending was over-indexed in the first half. In summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q3 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 200 basis points. Below operating margin, the improvement in other income reflects the offset to the employee benefit-related expense recorded in G&A. Our tax rate in Q3 was 15.7% due to benefits realized that were not previously contemplated. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.7 billion year-to-date, as expected, operating cash flows improved substantially in Q3, including a reduction in inventory from the prior quarter. We anticipate a continued normalization of working capital in Q4, including further improvements in our inventory balance as we trend toward levels that are closer to the prior year. We ended Q3 with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid over $1 billion in debt maturities, utilizing the proceeds from the February debt refinancing. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.9 times. We continue to move towards our net leverage target of 2.5 times. In summary, we executed well against our cash and net leverage improvement goals this quarter. We remain committed to enhancing our cash conversion and net leverage positions and expect more progress in Q4, including benefiting from the net proceeds from the divestiture of our Surgical Instrumentation Platform which will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Starting with our updated revenue guidance before the divestiture of the Surgical Instrumentation Platform. Given our strong third quarter performance, we are raising the midpoint of our base revenue guidance by 25 basis points to 7% and we now expect base revenues to be between 6.8% and 7.1%. This includes increases in the midpoint of both organic and inorganic revenue growth and reflects strong third quarter organic performance as well as inorganic momentum driven by our Parata Pharmacy Automation Solution, demonstrating our strong execution and M&A integration capabilities. Inorganic revenue is now expected to contribute approximately 135 basis points to full year base revenue growth. For the full year, base organic revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 5.8%, which continues to reflect strong fourth quarter organic revenue growth of about 6%. Our guidance continues to include the impact of strategic portfolio exits, which has moderated slightly from our original assumption. Finally, adjusting for the impact of the recently completed Surgical Instrumentation divestiture adjusts our updated base revenue growth guidance by 20 basis points to a range of 6.6% to 6.9% to reflect net inorganic revenue adjustments to base growth of approximately 115 basis points. Our increased base organic revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 5.8% is not impacted. Over a two year period, we are driving strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Our segment-specific growth assumptions have not changed. For COVID-only testing, our guidance only includes year-to-date revenues of $56 million. All in, we expect reported revenues to be approximately $19.3 billion, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion. Regarding the Alaris 510(k) clearance. As previously disclosed, we expect to ramp our return to market in our infusion business over time with our existing customers and remediation taking first priority. As we scale our manufacturing capacity and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to deliver our products in the right way, we are well positioned to engage with customers and execute as quickly as possible. However, we do not expect any material incremental revenue contribution from Alaris for the remainder of FY 2023, and we expect to begin a more regular rhythm of shipment and installation of devices and recognizing revenue as we progress through FY 2024. Within our FY 2023 guidance range, we expect to absorb any initial investments beyond the sales and service organizations we retained to successfully support our return to market. Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full year. We are executing as planned and have line of sight to our targeted margin improvement. Below operating income, our assumption regarding interest other remains unchanged. We have lowered our effective tax rate guidance to be between 13% and 13.5%. The midpoint of our updated tax guidance range is essentially equivalent to our FY 2022 actual effective tax rate of 13.3% and as a result, is not incrementally contributing to FY 2023 EPS growth. Our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12.10 to $12.32 remains unchanged, but reflects absorbing a $0.02 negative impact from the divestiture of our surgical instrumentation platform and a $0.05 negative impact from the latest FX rates. We are raising our base business earnings forecast by $0.07 based on our strong third quarter performance, including consistent execution of our margin goals, offsetting the impact of the divestiture and FX. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect adjusted EPS growth of about 10% to 11.5% and driven by very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14.5% to 16%, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior expectation. As a result, given our strong growth and execution on a year-to-date basis versus our original guidance in November. We\u2019ve increased our adjusted base business earnings per share by about $0.27, which added 225 basis points to growth, resulting in the 14.5% to 16% growth on our base. This also includes absorbing another year of outsized inflation of about 200 basis points. These strong base business results enabled us to fully absorb an increased earnings headwind associated with the loss of COVID-only revenue as well as lost earnings associated with the recent surgical instrumentation divestiture and still increase our total FXN growth rate by 75 basis points to 10% to 11.5% double-digit earnings growth. As you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. We\u2019ve outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides. First, our increased organic guidance continues to reflect strong growth of about 6% in Q4. As a reminder, we\u2019ve now anniversaried the acquisitions of Parata and MedKeeper. Second, as you think about margins, as we\u2019ve described throughout the year, most of the full year improvement is expected to come from SSG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin, which has been muted year-to-date because of outsized inflation. For operating margin, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. However, versus our last update in May, the amount of expansion needed has been reduced by about 75 basis points, and thus, we de-risked our Q4 delivery. There are several factors driving Q4 operating margin, including expense leverage, on expected strong revenue performance, inflation mitigation actions to offset outsized inflation and cost of goods sold, SSG&A expense reductions driven by the timing of spend and the full quarter impact of our more recent simplification initiatives. Also, R&D as a percentage of revenue will continue to moderate lower to about 5% of sales, resulting in full year spend of about 6%. Finally, there is also a favorable comparison to the prior year reinvestment of COVID-only testing profits. As we look ahead to FY 2024, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our BD2025 strategic and financial goals. While it is premature to commit to specifics, I can offer the following thoughts as we look ahead. As discussed, we continue to operate in a macro environment that remains uncertain and an inflationary environment that has moderated but remains elevated. We are especially focused on monitoring how various governments such as China respond to economic and other dynamics. With that said, med tech in general has proven to be much more durable during times of uncertainty, including economic downturns. And certainly, BD has a proven strategy and has demonstrated not only the ability to be resilient, but to deliver strong growth in earnings during the most challenging times. Our market-leading portfolio, strong innovation pipeline, continued shift into high-growth end markets and track record of execution gives us confidence in delivering against our 5.5% plus target next year. With respect to Alaris, we are excited to shift our focus and reengage with our customers. The clearance of Alaris offers much needed certainty to our stakeholders. As previously noted, it increases our confidence in executing against our BD2025 targets. Just two weeks after clearance, it would be premature to provide a range of expected revenue in FY 2024. However, consistent with what we\u2019ve shared we expect to ramp revenues back to our pre-ship hold level of approximately $400 million over time. Our focus will be replacing and upgrading pumps for our existing customers. At this juncture, knowing we have some level of Alaris revenue in our FY 2023 base of around $100 million, we would anticipate a modest level of revenue above that, which could result in about a 50 basis point tailwind to growth in FY 2024. As a result, based on current assumptions and the macro environment factors I mentioned we are monitoring, our base growth with Alaris would be approximately 6%. We will share more about other assumptions across our portfolio when we solidify our FY 2024 plans. As a reminder, if you look outside of our base business, in FY 2023, we have realized nearly $16 [ph] million in COVID-only revenue. Based on current dynamics, we would not expect material revenue in FY 2024 and which results in an expected headwind of about 30 basis points that you need to adjust for. Additionally, the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform will have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total growth. This does not impact our organic growth, which should be considered in your total FXN revenue growth. We will true up for currency when we provide FY 2024 guidance in November. Regarding earnings, we remain confident in our double-digit earnings growth profile of about 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. This includes absorbing the reduction to earnings associated with lower COVID-only testing revenue and the divestiture impact. Combined, these items are worth about 125 basis points. We will share more details when we give our guidance, but given we expect to finish FY 2023 at 70% of our 25% operating margin goal by 2025. At this point, we are tracking ahead of our 2025 margin goals. Importantly, this gives us the flexibility to deliver on our margin goals while investing to maximize growth and deliver on our double-digit earnings growth target. As we finalize our plans, we will look at optimizing the ratio of growth versus margin increase that delivers against these goals. In summary, we see our value proposition as differentiated and importantly, have consistently executed against our commitments, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver against our future goals. In closing, we are consistently delivering multiple periods of outsized financial performance. I would like to thank our associates around the world who are working hard to deliver on our purpose and help us achieve these results. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance and our progress towards our BD 2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth. With that, let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good execution here. Tom, maybe my first question here on Alaris. I think you mentioned 50 basis points contribution to growth in fiscal 2024. That would imply, I think total Alaris revenues of $200 million. Can you talk about \u2013 is there any supply chain constraints in terms of delivering pumps for next year? My understanding, yes, the markets hasn\u2019t undergone a replacement cycle in three years. So why are we assuming a modest Alaris contribution or ramp in fiscal 2024?\nTom Polen: Hey, Vijay, good morning and thanks for the recognition of a strong quarter by the team. Just as we get into Alaris, I just want to take a moment and just reiterate some comments that I made on the prepared remarks, which was to thank our team for the efforts to get it here. This is obviously a tremendous milestone. It\u2019s been our number one priority since we kicked off BD 2025. I also want to thank our customers for sticking with us through this process. On your question \u2013 so first, I think it\u2019s important, let\u2019s keep it in perspective, we\u2019re two weeks post clearance, right? And our teams have been heads down reaching out to our customers, getting our service organization trained on the new pump. We\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve contacted the vast majority of our customers, and the feedback is positive. At this time, I think the number that we\u2019ve shared is the prudent number. We\u2019ve always said it\u2019s going to be a ramp over time and that we will get back to the $400 million we expect, but that will be ramping over time. And at this point, two weeks into the process, we see that number as appropriate. We have done some pre-buys on materials coming into clearance. We\u2019re obviously continuing to do that. But we are scaling up to an unprecedented level as we think about also splitting componentry between people purchasing as well as remediating pumps. So we keep that in mind. That\u2019s a process and as it continues to evolve, we\u2019ll continue to provide updates. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any other feedback to that here in the room.\nMike Garrison: Thanks, Vijay, for the question. And this is Mike Garrison. And there are no near-term supply chain constraints. We were able to secure componentry. We are scaling up manufacturing, as Tom mentioned, from our current run rate up to what we look to supply the entire market. And that will take a little bit of time. We want to make sure that we train people effectively get all the componentry in place and get the cells working the right way, but there\u2019s no supply chain constraints at this time.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful comment. And then maybe one more on \u2013 and I think you mentioned biotech as being a tailwind. How should we think about GLP-1 opportunities within your pharma portfolio? I think some of your tools peers have made cautious comments on biopharma spending. Is that a cause for concern here in Biosciences? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Yes. Great question. Obviously, so I\u2019ll break that into two questions. On the biopharma side and Dave can comment further. Obviously, you saw very strong growth out of our Biosciences business. I think that the pace of innovation that we\u2019re driving in that business across instrumentation and reagents as well as just the customer base being perhaps more research-focused and large pharma focused then dependent upon the smaller biotech funding that you\u2019re seeing impact from other companies. We\u2019re seeing strong durability in our performance within the Biosciences business. When it comes to specific drug categories, obviously, you saw another phenomenal quarter out of Pharma Systems in Q3. We feel really good about the continued momentum of that business. We don\u2019t \u2013 all of our customers there, it\u2019s a confidential relationships between us and our customers, so we don\u2019t comment on any specific molecules or individual customers. But obviously, the capacity that we\u2019ve been adding, and as we\u2019ve said before, we have five to six extra capacity of the nearest competitor in that space. As there\u2019s large molecules coming to market, of course, our capacity position is an advantage, and we have discussions with customers around that. So we can\u2019t comment on any specific one, but we\u2019re certainly in a very good position to serve very large, fast-growing markets. Dave you have comments on Biosciences?\nDave Hickey: Yes. Just \u2013 hey Vijay, specifically on Biosciences and just \u2013 I mean, obviously, it was another strong quarter for us 7%, and we\u2019re seeing good continued growth in life science research and clinical, specifically on biotech biopharma. We have the advantage that for our own bioscience business, we\u2019ve got a very broad range of customer segments, right? So academic research, biotech, of course, pharmas, CROs, hospitals. So we\u2019re not necessarily dependent upon just one or two few customer types. And then given where our specific solutions are used in pharma, biopharma primarily used for discovery and translational research and then clinical studies for those new molecules. So it\u2019s very much earlier in the discovery process and those types of companies still need to do that work so that they can identify those molecules for their own future growth. So I think given where we apply, we\u2019re not seeing as much impact.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys. \nTom Polen: Hey thanks for the question, Vijay. \nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the clearance of Alaris. I do want to focus on Alaris. And Tom \u2013 and team, I\u2019ll ask a multipart question here and just one upfront. So the remediation and replacement plan, Tom, can you talk about the cost and time line there? And is FDA going to allow you? When is FDA going to allow you to commercialize above the $100 million in medical necessity. Is there kind of a gating factor here? And how should we think about the pent-up demand, Tom? Do you think that at some point \u2013 I mean it\u2019s about $1 billion in backlog. Do you think at some point, you\u2019ll exceed $400 million per year to exhaust that backlog? And just lastly, when you remove Alaris from the market or put it on ship hold \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, you reduced EPS by about $0.70 for two-thirds of the year. So when can investors expect to get back, what they lost in the earnings here? Thank you. \nTom Polen: Hi Larry, great set of questions. So, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. So when it comes to remediation and CMN, so first off, the 510(k) fully replaces the CMN process. So the CMN process essentially ended and the 510(k) clearance replaces that program. As we think about moving forward in terms of remediation, of course, our focus is prioritizing existing customers to update or replace existing devices to the cleared version. That\u2019s our number one priority now with clearance, and that\u2019s the focus of our efforts is within our existing customer base. To your point, there is a lot of pent-up demand as people have aged fleets. And that is also one of that among our existing customers, those with older pumps are our top priority to get those upgraded or replaced to the current cleared version. So that\u2019s how we view that. And then as we think about EPS, of course, we\u2019ve been driving a very strong growth profile. And in our BD 2025 strategy and Chris can add in further here. In our BD 2025 strategy, we had included the relaunch of Alaris in that. That was very clear at the time. As we set bold margin goals to reach and later updated those goals and increase them to 25% operating margin by 2025. We\u2019re obviously very much on track to that goal. And as we think about the EPS and the margin impact, which was about 80 bps, if you recall at the time, right, that\u2019s coming back in and will continue to come back in, in line with the strategy that we\u2019ve put out. So maybe we start with Chris, anything to add there on the margin side? Alaris is a good question. And then, Mike, if anything to add on the remediation pent-up demand.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. I think on the margin side, Tom, you covered it well. There was the 80 basis points that we talked about that was historic. Obviously, a lot\u2019s changed since then, including moving into an inflationary environment. And as you\u2019ve seen from our performance, we\u2019ve been taking a lot of actions in our business to drive margin improvement across the board. But that 80 points will certainly come back. It was always part of our 2025 by 2025 [ph] goals. You should really see that more scale as we\u2019re going to be going through kind of think of a ramp period with Alaris. And certainly, even as you think of the front end around margin, right? One, these are dilutive to GP in terms of the BD level, right? So just keep that in mind. And there\u2019s going to be investments that we need to make that are incremental above and beyond the investments that we retain. First of all, you do have some variable items such as shipping, communication materials, marketing, customer service, ramp up, all of that. Additionally, in the short term that there\u2019s going to be added things. What we\u2019re trying to do as we get back. So certainly, it\u2019s going to be a contributor. And I would point to our FY 2024, which is obviously preliminary. We\u2019re looking at all the market factors that are out there and geopolitical dynamics, et cetera, but we wanted to be prudent and provide some perspective on the momentum we have on 2024 and where we\u2019re heading. But you\u2019ll notice we committed to around 10% EPS growth, which includes absorbing the divestiture and the further headwinds in terms of COVID-only revenues dropping. So it actually implies a base earnings growth above 11%. Some of that is, of course, the momentum we have in our base business, the margin Alaris. So, I think collectively, you see us getting to those goals and the Alaris margin is certainly part of that.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks you so much guys. \nMike Garrison: The only thing I\u2019d add, Larry, and thanks for the question. As we are cleared to market BD Alaris system in the United States. It feels really, really good. To say that after three and a half years, and we\u2019re also really thankful to our customers that throughout this whole process and through a pandemic and through all the challenges they face, they\u2019ve demonstrated their preference for the Alaris system. And so that is our focus. And a priority, first and foremost, is to take care of them and make sure that improvements that are in the cleared product get to them first. So that\u2019s going to be the focus there. It is \u2013 we do have the largest fleet in the field. So the size and breadth sort of extends the time line. It\u2019s just going to take a fair amount of time to get through everything. But we\u2019re looking to do that as expeditiously as possible and scale up manufacturing to sort of meet that need. And then we also noticed during COVID that interoperability was a real benefit where nursing and nursing staff didn\u2019t have to spend as much time manually programming the pumps at the bed side. They were able to utilize the interoperability to interface with the electronic medical record that has some time line from an implementation standpoint, it takes a little bit longer to implement to get those advantages. We think there\u2019s going to be some increased demand for interoperability from the field, and that may sort of extend implementation times a little bit. So that\u2019s another factor to think about as we\u2019re doing this upgrade and replacement.\nTom Polen: Maybe just one last one to add on to Mike\u2019s good comment, so it\u2019s great to be back. Obviously, we\u2019re focused on prioritizing our existing customers and replacing existing devices to the cleared version with a big focus on the older systems. But the other big thing that this allows us to do beyond servicing our customers and helping them refresh their fleets and make sure they have the cleared technology, the most modern technology with all the incremental benefits and upgrades that are in this version, which are fantastic is that we can continue now. We have a basis by which to innovate upon. And that\u2019s a big deal, right? We\u2019ve had a great track record of being first in a number of areas in infusion, right? We were the first company with fully integrated system. We still are the only company and will be with one system approach, right? One interface, much easier for clinicians. We led the way with guardrails with interoperability. Now we have the most advanced wireless cybersecurity on the latest pump, the most modern that\u2019s available. And as we think going ahead, we see other innovations that we already have plan to build upon this, which will continue to add value to our customers. And we already have planned a cadence of additional 510(k)s going forward. And that\u2019s a big deal. Of course, we also have and we\u2019re the first company, and they\u2019re the only company who have integrated pumps beyond being stand-alone devices, but making them part of improving the overall medication management ecosystem, right, with Alaris and our software in the pharmacy. And that has been something that customers have significantly valued. It\u2019s one of the reasons that, as Mike mentioned, most Alaris customers have stuck with us over this time because of all the value that I described. We\u2019re going to now be able to continue to add to that and continue to advance our innovation leadership built upon this 510(k). And so our teams are really excited about that and our R&D teams are already on working on what\u2019s next. So thanks for the question, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for the questions and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe a follow-up on Larry\u2019s question. A lot of analysts across the street were thinking about how big of a backlog there could be in the market. You were doing about $400 million in run rate Alaris sales pre recall. There\u2019s been a couple of years where there just hasn\u2019t been enough replacement in the market. I\u2019ve seen estimates anywhere from a few $100 million all the way up to $1 billion. So to help level set people. Is there any number you could put around what you think could have been sold during that time if normal replacement happened, but didn\u2019t? And how to think about how quickly that can come back into extra sales to replace the fleets out there?\nTom Polen: Robbie, good question, and I appreciate the recognition of the team. Yes. At this point, again, we\u2019re two weeks into clearance. And I think what we\u2019ve shared in the preliminary outlook for 2024 is what we think is a prudent number to share today. As we continue to advance, we\u2019ll continue to update that. I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that there was \u2013 the last couple of years have not been normal years by any means, there\u2019s been a global pandemic and a lot going on in the healthcare system. We also had placed quite a large number of pumps during the global pandemic because Alaris is such a trusted and essential part of delivering healthcare, it was needed in much more significant levels than it has ever been needed before. And so a number of customers added into their fleets at that point in time. So we\u2019re going to get a better sense as we continue beyond the two week period, we get in further periods, get into the months and we\u2019ll continue to update as that moves. Maybe Chris, any other comments to add there? Mike?\nChris DelOrefice: Well, I mean, I think you answered it well. I mean I just \u2013 I think what you talked about is there\u2019s the Alaris benefit that gives us a natural glide path to continue to build on momentum we\u2019ve had the past two years, first two years of our BD 2025 strategy. You could see what we put forth in 2024, and we\u2019re talking about base growth of around 6% now, which is I think, an exciting commitment at this juncture. And certainly, it will be a catalyst going forward. And I think beyond to Tom\u2019s point, Alaris in itself, but really capitalizing on the full value proposition of our Medical segment.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And sorry, but one more Alaris question. In the approval, you talked about that there \u2013 some of the pumps out there would have to be replaced and some would have to be remediated. Can you maybe speak to exactly what makes a pump qualify for replacement versus remediation and what percentage needs to be replaced versus remediated and the difference in costs associated with it? Thanks. \nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Just the remediation process is very multifaceted complex. We\u2019re working with the agency on this. On a case-by-case basis, it needs to match the 510(k), the cleared and so that\u2019s sort of what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ll be going out, doing walk-throughs at the customers, customers through COVID may have had mixed fleets of different ages of pumps, things like that. So we need to kind of go on a customer-by-customer basis and in some cases, a pump-by-pump basis. So that\u2019s where that stands. We\u2019ve \u2013 our commitment is mainly to our \u2013 and our priorities for our existing customers that have stuck bias. Something just to go back to the previous question, the run rate at the \u2013 in sort of 2018, 2019, that had a fair amount of competitive position gain. So \u2013 because our Alaris product was being preferred at that time and we were gaining position in the marketplace. Probably in the near-term here, we\u2019ll be focused on the remediation and the replacement of our existing customers. So that\u2019s something just to think about from a pent-up demand perspective.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot. \nTom Polen: Hey Robbie, this is the last thing. I think if you refer to the prepared comments as well. We did make the comment that we do continue to engage with the FDA on how we intend to execute those remediation plans and the combination of upgrades and replacements and that we will provide more information as we progress. So just to bring you back to those prepared remarks as well. So great question.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. \nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll just ask two quick ones upfront if that works. Yes. You touched on the \u2013 and I appreciate you\u2019re not guiding for 2024. But the margin expansion. And if you hit your guide for this year, you\u2019ll obviously exit the year with a very strong finish kind of 26% or so. So I guess like how are you thinking about investing to support the launches next year relative to margin gain given it looks like you\u2019re running about a year out of schedule potentially. Any color around there would be great. And then the second one is just a quick one maybe on MMS. I mean, very, very strong underlying growth and given that drops into organic pretty much next quarter onwards. Just curious what you\u2019re hearing from customers, how you think about the durability within, whether it\u2019s the pharmacy side or anything else? Just any details, that would be great. Thanks. \nTom Polen: Thanks, Patrick, for the great questions. We\u2019ll start with Chris.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes. Regarding margins, to your point, we\u2019ve executed very strong in a very complex environment, right past two years. We\u2019ve had over 400 basis points of outsized inflation despite that. We\u2019ve had nearly 400 basis points of base margin expansion. And so that puts us 70% of the way on track to the 25% goal. So we feel really good about that. If you do sort of the implied kind of math in the next two years, you would need roughly 50 basis points to 75 basis points per year. We don\u2019t want to share specifics at this time as it relates to margin profile. There\u2019s lots to consider within the P&L. It\u2019s obviously early from a guide, but I think what it offers us the way you should think of it is we have a de-risked path to 25% over the next two years. Not only that, it gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to ensure that, to your point, we\u2019re balancing an investment posture against continuing to drive outsized top-line growth while still achieving our margin goals. So those will be the puts and takes that we\u2019ll think about as we move forward. I think the last comment I would make is, we have a strong profile and pipeline of margin improvement initiatives that have already been underway now for years. So these aren\u2019t just numbers that are on a page to get to an outcome. We have detailed plans that get there and detailed plans that are de-risked in a way that we would plan knowing that execution doesn\u2019t always happen or you have other headwinds that may happen and gives us confidence to get to that number, but also some of those efficiency plans can be reinvested back in the business, too. So I think it\u2019s a very good position to be in, and we\u2019ll continue to share more as we get closer to 2024.\nTom Polen: Great. And obviously, on MMS, a really strong quarter prior to Alaris clearance obviously occurring. And so some really good things happening in the base business there, Mike?\nMike Garrison: Yes. Thanks for the question, MMS, a couple of things to note. There is a little bit of an easy compare to last year. Last year, if you recall, at this time, there were some COVID shutdowns in China. That had some implications in terms of supply chain delivery. But that was \u2013 that\u2019s not the real driver here. The real driver here is pharmacy automation and dispensing and the value proposition that we have around the combination of patient safety and clinician productivity. And those two things are resonating with our customers. And the Parata acquisition, our BD ROWA, both growing double digits and really helping to transform the way healthcare is thinking about the pharmacy and the value that it can provide moving those pharmacists to work at the top of their license instead of counting to five pills at a time into amber bottles day-in, day-out. On the dispensing side, we really changed our approach a few years ago around innovation and started to focus on a cadence of innovation and dispensing making it more connected, making it more focused on controlled substance management, these types of things. And it\u2019s really started to pay off in the marketplace. That\u2019s really resonating. And it\u2019s helping clinicians, especially during labor shortages and nurse shortages and things like that, to better effectively do their jobs in the hospitals. So the dispensing, the organic, I think, for MMS was quite strong, really driven by dispensing. Some other comments there from a capital allocation perspective, I think our flexible models there help for some customers where we can enter into lease agreements and things like that. So that helps for some customers, whereas other customers have the ability and they invest and they partner with us for the long term there.\nPatrick Wood: Thanks for taking the questions.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. And I\u2019m sorry, just one other comment on margins that you made, because I know you mentioned the Q4 exit being, remember, there are some \u2013 which is important as you think of us delivering and our confidence to deliver in Q4. There are some timing dynamics in there, right? The phasing of R&D, we\u2019ve talked about, there\u2019s some phasing in SSG&A. There\u2019s some comp dynamics in there. Those are worth between 150 basis points and 200 basis points. So that\u2019s not a pure exit rate that you should think of that\u2019s hot. The other nice thing is we actually de-risked our Q4 margin versus last guide. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s about 75 bps depending on how you look at it relative to our last planning stand. So we feel really good about this year then as I shared before, the momentum beyond.\nPatrick Wood: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nTom Polen: Hey good morning, Matt.\nMike Sarcone: This is Mike Sarcone on for Matt today. Thanks for taking my questions. Just another one on the Alaris remediation. I\u2019m just curious, are there any gating factors from the customer side, things that might be out of your control? So, we\u2019re seeing pretty robust procedure volume growth across med tech. Does this plus any remaining staffing constraints limit customer ability to take time out to remediate or replace their fleets?\nTom Polen: Sure. Turn that to Mike.\nMike Garrison: Sure. I think maybe in like the acute sense at a particular hospital, but there just be \u2013 that\u2019s a scheduling issue more than their ability to do it at all. So, I would just think of it that way that there may be \u2013 we can\u2019t do it this week or we can\u2019t do it this month. We can do it next month. It\u2019s more that planning piece, but that\u2019s something that we do anyway, whether it\u2019s on the dispensing side, pharmacy automation. We\u2019re constantly flexing to optimize and work with our customers based on how they can accept it. It\u2019s not our belief at this time that the customer side is going to be a significant barrier in the long run. I think it will be more in the phasing of things over time. Does that help?\nMike Sarcone: That does help. Thank you. And then just one question on Pharm Systems. You\u2019ve been posting some really strong growth there. It looks like you\u2019re on a mid-teens growth trajectory. Do you think you can just discuss kind of key drivers and how you view the sustainability of that \u2013 the growth in that business looking out to 2024 and through the 2025 plan?\nMike Garrison: Sure. So the primary drivers around Pharm Systems are the sort of move towards biologics and the innovation that\u2019s coming out of the pharmaceutical industry towards biologics. I think there\u2019s a question earlier around GLP-1 and the use of GLP-1s moving from Type 2 diabetes to treat a broader population for obesity. That\u2019s 1 driver that\u2019s significant, but there\u2019s also a wealth of clinical data coming out around Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, cancer treatments, things like that. And these are biological molecules that are quite sensitive to the primary container closure device that\u2019s used to house them. Our technology is really well suited for those types of molecules. And so if we think about the end-user population, the obesity, mental decline with age, cancer, these are very broad patient populations. And so the same sort of main driver that pharma is using there, we are able to support that. So we think that there is a fair amount of durability into the long-term demand here. I think there are also some factors. There is some COVID reset that we are also tracking very closely in the marketplace. The drugs that were used to treat during COVID that went into prefilled syringes, for example, those are being reset in the marketplace. And so we\u2019re watching that to get a good feel for that. But long term, we feel really good about our position in this place. We also just welcome the new president for that business. So we\u2019re really happy to have her start, and she\u2019s coming up to speed very quickly.\nTom Polen: Mike, and maybe just to complement what the good feedback that Mike gave is, we have a nice cadence of innovation in that business that\u2019s supporting those overall trends as well as, of course, the over $1 billion of capacity that we\u2019ve added. And so you\u2019ve got these great kind of the unmet needs and continued demand cycle that\u2019s happening from pharma driven by biologics. We invested ahead of the curve right in the middle of the pandemic, a pretty bold decision to add capacity in that period of time, and you can see that paying off now. And then a series of innovations, not only on our high-pack syringes but also on the self-injection side. These biologics \u2013 people are moved. They don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s moving from sitting in a clinic with IV in your arm or going into a clinician to get injections as these are becoming biologics are addressing chronic disease. The focus is enabling patients to deliver these medications subcutaneously by themselves in the home, not be an infusion or an injection by a clinician. And so our self-injection business is also doing well and has a number of new innovations, wearables, as an example, our Libertas platform. We\u2019re seeing solid demand. Our auto infuser that\u2019s wearable. Our pen, for example, that has quite a number of biosimilar insulins coming to market and a large percentage of those are coming in our pen format. We\u2019re seeing strong demand there in addition to the high pack business. And so all that wraps up what \u2013 and supports what Mike said. Thanks for the question.\nMike Sarcone: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Tom for any closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay. Well, thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call and for all of your questions. Before we sign off, I want to again thank our global team of BD associates who continue to execute against our BD 2025 strategy and are making meaningful impacts for our customers and their patients. Particularly, I want to thank our team for their efforts related to the clearance of the updated BD Alaris Infusion System. And for all the work ahead as we move forward in working with our customers, to update, replace existing devices [Technical Difficulty]. We are meeting our commitments and delivering strong, consistent performance with an increased outlook and we look forward to connecting with everyone again in November. And operator with that, we will end today\u2019s call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s audio and webcast. On behalf of BD, we thank you for joining today.

            "content": "Thanks, Vijay, for the question. And this is Mike Garrison. And there are no near-term supply chain constraints. We were able to secure componentry. We are scaling up manufacturing, as Tom mentioned, from our current run rate up to what we look to supply the entire market. And that will take a little bit of time. We want to make sure that we train people effectively get all the componentry in place and get the cells working the right way, but there's no supply chain constraints at this time. The only thing I'd add, Larry, and thanks for the question. As we are cleared to market BD Alaris system in the United States. It feels really, really good. To say that after three and a half years, and we're also really thankful to our customers that throughout this whole process and through a pandemic and through all the challenges they face, they've demonstrated their preference for the Alaris system. And so that is our focus. And a priority, first and foremost, is to take care of them and make sure that improvements that are in the cleared product get to them first. So that's going to be the focus there. It is \u2013 we do have the largest fleet in the field. So the size and breadth sort of extends the time line. It's just going to take a fair amount of time to get through everything. But we're looking to do that as expeditiously as possible and scale up manufacturing to sort of meet that need. And then we also noticed during COVID that interoperability was a real benefit where nursing and nursing staff didn't have to spend as much time manually programming the pumps at the bed side. They were able to utilize the interoperability to interface with the electronic medical record that has some time line from an implementation standpoint, it takes a little bit longer to implement to get those advantages. We think there's going to be some increased demand for interoperability from the field, and that may sort of extend implementation times a little bit. So that's another factor to think about as we're doing this upgrade and replacement. Yes. Thanks for the question, MMS, a couple of things to note. There is a little bit of an easy compare to last year. Last year, if you recall, at this time, there were some COVID shutdowns in China. That had some implications in terms of supply chain delivery. But that was \u2013 that's not the real driver here. The real driver here is pharmacy automation and dispensing and the value proposition that we have around the combination of patient safety and clinician productivity. And those two things are resonating with our customers. And the Parata acquisition, our BD ROWA, both growing double digits and really helping to transform the way healthcare is thinking about the pharmacy and the value that it can provide moving those pharmacists to work at the top of their license instead of counting to five pills at a time into amber bottles day-in, day-out. On the dispensing side, we really changed our approach a few years ago around innovation and started to focus on a cadence of innovation and dispensing making it more connected, making it more focused on controlled substance management, these types of things. And it's really started to pay off in the marketplace. That's really resonating. And it's helping clinicians, especially during labor shortages and nurse shortages and things like that, to better effectively do their jobs in the hospitals. So the dispensing, the organic, I think, for MMS was quite strong, really driven by dispensing. Some other comments there from a capital allocation perspective, I think our flexible models there help for some customers where we can enter into lease agreements and things like that. So that helps for some customers, whereas other customers have the ability and they invest and they partner with us for the long term there. Sure. I think maybe in like the acute sense at a particular hospital, but there just be \u2013 that's a scheduling issue more than their ability to do it at all. So, I would just think of it that way that there may be \u2013 we can't do it this week or we can't do it this month. We can do it next month. It's more that planning piece, but that's something that we do anyway, whether it's on the dispensing side, pharmacy automation. We're constantly flexing to optimize and work with our customers based on how they can accept it. It's not our belief at this time that the customer side is going to be a significant barrier in the long run. I think it will be more in the phasing of things over time. Does that help? Sure. So the primary drivers around Pharm Systems are the sort of move towards biologics and the innovation that's coming out of the pharmaceutical industry towards biologics. I think there's a question earlier around GLP-1 and the use of GLP-1s moving from Type 2 diabetes to treat a broader population for obesity. That's 1 driver that's significant, but there's also a wealth of clinical data coming out around Alzheimer's treatment, cancer treatments, things like that. And these are biological molecules that are quite sensitive to the primary container closure device that's used to house them. Our technology is really well suited for those types of molecules. And so if we think about the end-user population, the obesity, mental decline with age, cancer, these are very broad patient populations. And so the same sort of main driver that pharma is using there, we are able to support that. So we think that there is a fair amount of durability into the long-term demand here. I think there are also some factors. There is some COVID reset that we are also tracking very closely in the marketplace. The drugs that were used to treat during COVID that went into prefilled syringes, for example, those are being reset in the marketplace. And so we're watching that to get a good feel for that. But long term, we feel really good about our position in this place. We also just welcome the new president for that business. So we're really happy to have her start, and she's coming up to speed very quickly."

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of broad-based strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. Before we detail our quarterly performance, I want to highlight the 510(k) clearance we received on July 21 from the FDA for the updated BD Alaris Infusion System. This has been our number one priority since launching BD 2025, and we're pleased to deliver this important milestone. For more than 20 years, infusion pumps have represented the backbone of hospital operations. Over that time, Alaris was the first product that connected all patient modules into one integrated system and the first platform to introduce medication safety software, which led the way to interoperability with electronic medical records. And later with the launch of BD HealthSight, Alaris again led the way with integration into the full suite of BD end-to-end connected medication management solutions from the pharmacy to the administration of drugs at the patient's bedside. Today, the Alaris system continues to advance new levels of innovation with enhanced cybersecurity protection, the latest wireless capabilities and new features that enable various aspects of medication management and ultimately help clinicians deliver the best care. In short, we're proud of the Alaris Power of One that makes medication management safer, simpler and smarter. With this clearance, we address all open recalls with the latest hardware and a new version of software as well as provide important cybersecurity updates. We can now focus on bringing the updated system to the market, ensuring our installed base is upgraded so customers can realize the full benefits of our latest technology. As we return to market, we will start with upgrading or replacing the hardware and software of Alaris system devices in the U.S. market with priority towards our existing customers. Given the breadth of our footprint, this effort will happen over a multiyear period. Just two weeks into clearance, we are well prepared. We immediately took action have contacted nearly all of our customers. We activated a dedicated team with daily stand-ups and have completed product training for our service teams on the cleared Alaris system. As we previously shared, we are prepared for clearance and our return to market. We have invested in and developed plans for operational capacity, and we've strengthened our supply chain. We have now activated those plans, which were dependent on clearance and are moving quickly to help ensure we can reliably supply our market-leading BD Alaris system and deliver for our customers. In parallel, we continue to engage with the FDA on how we intend to execute our remediation plans, which includes a combination of upgrades and replacements. We'll provide more information as we progress. Before I move on, I would like to thank our customers for their loyalty and patience as we work through this challenging period. Our teams are ready and committed to provide the high-quality service and partnership that you've come to expect from us. And on behalf of the entire BD leadership team, I want to extend our deep appreciation to the BD associates who work tirelessly to bring the updated BD Alaris system to market for their ongoing commitment to quality and ensuring we achieve this milestone in the right way, in line with our values. We'd also like to thank the FDA for their rigorous review and engagement as we went through the clearance process. Turning to our quarterly financial results. Our strategy and purposeful investments in innovation are driving consistent higher growth and fueling strong results and momentum. Our results are indicative of our leadership position in our durable core and intentional shifts towards higher growth end markets in a highly motivated and talented global team whose focus on execution is helping our customers provide more efficient and effective care. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results with 7.9% base revenue growth or 6.3% base organic and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Once again, our results reflect our strategy and action and our strong, consistent growth profile, which gives us the confidence to increase our FY 2023 organic growth rate. We also continue to make strong progress improving our on-time milestones and launches to another record level this year. Starting with a few examples of our recent launches. In our Medical segment, we introduced the BD Prevue II System, a first-to-world technology that magnetizes the tip of certain existing BD catheters and allows them to be seen under the preview ultrasound device. The software then guides clinicians to enter the vasculature with first stick success. This novel approach enables BD peripheral IVs to deliver new value to patients and providers. In our Biosciences business, we are seeing a super cycle of innovation this quarter with three key new product launches. In mid-May, we began shipping the BD FACSDiscover S8 cell sorter. Our customers are utilizing this new standard in flow cytometry to unlock life-changing discoveries across immunology, cancer research and cell biology by uncovering more detailed information about cells and how they interact that was previously invisible. The first installations are complete. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we are seeing strong demand. We also launched the BD Rhapsody HT Xpress, which enables access to the fast-growing single-cell multiomics market with a high throughput research solution. The HT Xpress can process up to 320,000 cells per run. Eightfold the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform, while leveraging Rhapsody's micro well designed to ensure high-quality results for all cell types. And most recently, we announced the launch of the BD FACSDuet Premium Sample Preparation System, a new robotic system to automate clinical flow cytometry enabling the only walk-away automation for both HIV and leukemia and lymphoma testing. And in our BDI segment, we launched the BD Trek Powered Bone Biopsy System, expanding our presence in oncology beyond the manual biopsy market. The BD Trek system allows for faster sampling with sizes to accommodate a variety of procedural needs. Our differentiated offering enables the ability to collect large intact samples while providing the clinical versatility to biopsy delicate areas that require precise targeting as well as bones that require power. We've also achieved several crucial development milestones this quarter. These include 510(k) submission of the Site-Rite 9 Ultrasound System, which is part of our vascular access management strategy. The Site-Rite 9 was developed to be the first integrated system that combines catheter and ultrasound navigation into a single device to simplify workflow, capital management and training for clinicians for the placement of BD Pyxis. In our IDS business, we are expanding the strategy for our BD Onclarity HPV franchise to enable patients to self-collect samples with the aim to promote health care equity by making cervical cancer screening accessible to women who historically haven't participated or have had limited access to testing. This is already in use across Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. Clinical trials are set to start in India, Africa and the U.S. later this year. We are proud of this work and its ability to advance our efforts to reduce health care and equities around the world. And in our PI business, we submitted and received IDE approval for our TIPS-Venous Stent Graft and are on track to enroll the first patient in Q4. Used in the liver, this novel self-expanding covered stent continues to expand our leadership position and build on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients. These launches and milestones are good examples of accelerated levels of innovation across our business and how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. We continue to simplify our company through programs across our manufacturing network and operating model while actively managing our portfolio. As such, we recently completed the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. This value-creating transaction supports the achievement of our BD 2025 financial goals and further advances the BDI segment's focus on high-growth end markets. This divestiture allows us to focus BD surgery strategic investments In Advanced Repair and Reconstruction and surgical complications, which are driving results and helping to address unmet needs in healthcare. Proceeds from the sale strengthened our cash and net leverage position and support our tuck-in acquisition strategy. We also continue to make progress on our other simplification initiatives, including the reduction of 20% of our SKUs by FY 2025. Ongoing network architecture optimization and our operating model initiatives to transition certain BD shared service center activities to a third-party to optimize our back-office processes and services. Looking externally let me share some perspective on the macro environment. Overall, the macro environment is in line with our view that challenges will persist, not escalate. However, uncertainty remains. We continue to monitor various factors, including how health systems, governments, distributors and suppliers are managing inflation, inventory and other supply chain dynamics. Broadly speaking, inflation is moderating, but is still elevated. The supply chain has continued to stabilize, and we're very pleased with our progress to reduce back orders. We expect to exit the year at pre-pandemic levels, which is enabling us to shift our focus to reducing raw material and some finished goods inventory, which is contributing to our cash flow improvement. While overall procedure volumes are healthy, our portfolio has been more durable and less impacted by significant short-lived fluctuations in procedure volumes. Overall, the capabilities we have built and the durability of our portfolio have positioned us well. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to share an update on our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 15th annual ESG report that details our progress on the four pillars of our ESG strategy, company health, human health, community health and planet health. The FY 2022 report highlights our notable progress in energy and waste reduction, health care access and diversity. Key achievements include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 10% from an FY 2019 baseline, an increase in the number of locations using renewable energy, the establishment of product recycling pilots around the world and completion of our baseline assessment for Scope 3 emissions. The report also highlights our ongoing work in advancing health equity in under-resourced communities and the product solutions and programs we're investing in, that directly address these in equities. BD has always played a tremendous role in addressing health disparities and access to health care around the world, and we're proud of our continued focus in this area. We are also proud to receive continued recognition for our commitment to talent and creating an inclusive culture. Most recently, we were recognized as the best place to work for disability inclusion for the fifth consecutive year, achieving a top score on the Disability Equality Index and we were named to U.S. News & World Report's inaugural Best Companies to Work for list. In summary, we continue to deliver consistent strong results. Our teams are working unwaveringly to achieve key milestones that sets us up for continued growth and consistent performance. And this quarter is another reflection of our focus and determination in achieving our BD 2025 goals. We continue to grow, simplify and empower BD and evolve into an agile, innovative medical technology company with a durable compelling growth profile. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Hey, Vijay, good morning and thanks for the recognition of a strong quarter by the team. Just as we get into Alaris, I just want to take a moment and just reiterate some comments that I made on the prepared remarks, which was to thank our team for the efforts to get it here. This is obviously a tremendous milestone. It's been our number one priority since we kicked off BD 2025. I also want to thank our customers for sticking with us through this process. On your question \u2013 so first, I think it's important, let's keep it in perspective, we're two weeks post clearance, right? And our teams have been heads down reaching out to our customers, getting our service organization trained on the new pump. We're pleased that we've contacted the vast majority of our customers, and the feedback is positive. At this time, I think the number that we've shared is the prudent number. We've always said it's going to be a ramp over time and that we will get back to the $400 million we expect, but that will be ramping over time. And at this point, two weeks into the process, we see that number as appropriate. We have done some pre-buys on materials coming into clearance. We're obviously continuing to do that. But we are scaling up to an unprecedented level as we think about also splitting componentry between people purchasing as well as remediating pumps. So we keep that in mind. That's a process and as it continues to evolve, we'll continue to provide updates. I don't know if there's any other feedback to that here in the room. Yes. Great question. Obviously, so I'll break that into two questions. On the biopharma side and Dave can comment further. Obviously, you saw very strong growth out of our Biosciences business. I think that the pace of innovation that we're driving in that business across instrumentation and reagents as well as just the customer base being perhaps more research-focused and large pharma focused then dependent upon the smaller biotech funding that you're seeing impact from other companies. We're seeing strong durability in our performance within the Biosciences business. When it comes to specific drug categories, obviously, you saw another phenomenal quarter out of Pharma Systems in Q3. We feel really good about the continued momentum of that business. We don't \u2013 all of our customers there, it's a confidential relationships between us and our customers, so we don't comment on any specific molecules or individual customers. But obviously, the capacity that we've been adding, and as we've said before, we have five to six extra capacity of the nearest competitor in that space. As there's large molecules coming to market, of course, our capacity position is an advantage, and we have discussions with customers around that. So we can't comment on any specific one, but we're certainly in a very good position to serve very large, fast-growing markets. Dave you have comments on Biosciences? Hey thanks for the question, Vijay. Hi Larry, great set of questions. So, I'll start and I'll turn it over to Mike. So when it comes to remediation and CMN, so first off, the 510(k) fully replaces the CMN process. So the CMN process essentially ended and the 510(k) clearance replaces that program. As we think about moving forward in terms of remediation, of course, our focus is prioritizing existing customers to update or replace existing devices to the cleared version. That's our number one priority now with clearance, and that's the focus of our efforts is within our existing customer base. To your point, there is a lot of pent-up demand as people have aged fleets. And that is also one of that among our existing customers, those with older pumps are our top priority to get those upgraded or replaced to the current cleared version. So that's how we view that. And then as we think about EPS, of course, we've been driving a very strong growth profile. And in our BD 2025 strategy and Chris can add in further here. In our BD 2025 strategy, we had included the relaunch of Alaris in that. That was very clear at the time. As we set bold margin goals to reach and later updated those goals and increase them to 25% operating margin by 2025. We're obviously very much on track to that goal. And as we think about the EPS and the margin impact, which was about 80 bps, if you recall at the time, right, that's coming back in and will continue to come back in, in line with the strategy that we've put out. So maybe we start with Chris, anything to add there on the margin side? Alaris is a good question. And then, Mike, if anything to add on the remediation pent-up demand. Maybe just one last one to add on to Mike's good comment, so it's great to be back. Obviously, we're focused on prioritizing our existing customers and replacing existing devices to the cleared version with a big focus on the older systems. But the other big thing that this allows us to do beyond servicing our customers and helping them refresh their fleets and make sure they have the cleared technology, the most modern technology with all the incremental benefits and upgrades that are in this version, which are fantastic is that we can continue now. We have a basis by which to innovate upon. And that's a big deal, right? We've had a great track record of being first in a number of areas in infusion, right? We were the first company with fully integrated system. We still are the only company and will be with one system approach, right? One interface, much easier for clinicians. We led the way with guardrails with interoperability. Now we have the most advanced wireless cybersecurity on the latest pump, the most modern that's available. And as we think going ahead, we see other innovations that we already have plan to build upon this, which will continue to add value to our customers. And we already have planned a cadence of additional 510(k)s going forward. And that's a big deal. Of course, we also have and we're the first company, and they're the only company who have integrated pumps beyond being stand-alone devices, but making them part of improving the overall medication management ecosystem, right, with Alaris and our software in the pharmacy. And that has been something that customers have significantly valued. It's one of the reasons that, as Mike mentioned, most Alaris customers have stuck with us over this time because of all the value that I described. We're going to now be able to continue to add to that and continue to advance our innovation leadership built upon this 510(k). And so our teams are really excited about that and our R&D teams are already on working on what's next. So thanks for the question, Larry. Robbie, good question, and I appreciate the recognition of the team. Yes. At this point, again, we're two weeks into clearance. And I think what we've shared in the preliminary outlook for 2024 is what we think is a prudent number to share today. As we continue to advance, we'll continue to update that. I think it's also important to recognize that there was \u2013 the last couple of years have not been normal years by any means, there's been a global pandemic and a lot going on in the healthcare system. We also had placed quite a large number of pumps during the global pandemic because Alaris is such a trusted and essential part of delivering healthcare, it was needed in much more significant levels than it has ever been needed before. And so a number of customers added into their fleets at that point in time. So we're going to get a better sense as we continue beyond the two week period, we get in further periods, get into the months and we'll continue to update as that moves. Maybe Chris, any other comments to add there? Mike? Hey Robbie, this is the last thing. I think if you refer to the prepared comments as well. We did make the comment that we do continue to engage with the FDA on how we intend to execute those remediation plans and the combination of upgrades and replacements and that we will provide more information as we progress. So just to bring you back to those prepared remarks as well. So great question. Thanks, Patrick, for the great questions. We'll start with Chris. Great. And obviously, on MMS, a really strong quarter prior to Alaris clearance obviously occurring. And so some really good things happening in the base business there, Mike? Hey good morning, Matt. Sure. Turn that to Mike. Mike, and maybe just to complement what the good feedback that Mike gave is, we have a nice cadence of innovation in that business that's supporting those overall trends as well as, of course, the over $1 billion of capacity that we've added. And so you've got these great kind of the unmet needs and continued demand cycle that's happening from pharma driven by biologics. We invested ahead of the curve right in the middle of the pandemic, a pretty bold decision to add capacity in that period of time, and you can see that paying off now. And then a series of innovations, not only on our high-pack syringes but also on the self-injection side. These biologics \u2013 people are moved. They don't \u2013 it's moving from sitting in a clinic with IV in your arm or going into a clinician to get injections as these are becoming biologics are addressing chronic disease. The focus is enabling patients to deliver these medications subcutaneously by themselves in the home, not be an infusion or an injection by a clinician. And so our self-injection business is also doing well and has a number of new innovations, wearables, as an example, our Libertas platform. We're seeing solid demand. Our auto infuser that's wearable. Our pen, for example, that has quite a number of biosimilar insulins coming to market and a large percentage of those are coming in our pen format. We're seeing strong demand there in addition to the high pack business. And so all that wraps up what \u2013 and supports what Mike said. Thanks for the question. Okay. Well, thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call and for all of your questions. Before we sign off, I want to again thank our global team of BD associates who continue to execute against our BD 2025 strategy and are making meaningful impacts for our customers and their patients. Particularly, I want to thank our team for their efforts related to the clearance of the updated BD Alaris Infusion System. And for all the work ahead as we move forward in working with our customers, to update, replace existing devices [Technical Difficulty]. We are meeting our commitments and delivering strong, consistent performance with an increased outlook and we look forward to connecting with everyone again in November. And operator with that, we will end today's call."

            "content": "Yes. Just \u2013 hey Vijay, specifically on Biosciences and just \u2013 I mean, obviously, it was another strong quarter for us 7%, and we're seeing good continued growth in life science research and clinical, specifically on biotech biopharma. We have the advantage that for our own bioscience business, we've got a very broad range of customer segments, right? So academic research, biotech, of course, pharmas, CROs, hospitals. So we're not necessarily dependent upon just one or two few customer types. And then given where our specific solutions are used in pharma, biopharma primarily used for discovery and translational research and then clinical studies for those new molecules. So it's very much earlier in the discovery process and those types of companies still need to do that work so that they can identify those molecules for their own future growth. So I think given where we apply, we're not seeing as much impact."

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our BD 2025 strategy is driving consistent performance in an outsized growth profile. We are advancing our innovation pipeline and delivering against our revenue, margin, and EPS goals. We're also making progress strengthening our balance sheet with lower inventory and net leverage, consistent with the commitments we made. With strong year-to-date results, we are well on track to achieve our updated FY 2023 guidance. And with the addition of Alaris return to market, we are increasingly confident in achieving our BD 2025 long-term targets of 5.5% plus organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Beginning with some color on our revenue performance. We delivered strong Q3 base revenue growth of 7.9% or 6.3% organic. Base organic growth includes growing over prior year respiratory testing sales which negatively impacted base growth by approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, our tuck-in acquisition strategy continues to enable profitable growth with organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried contributing about 40 basis points in the quarter and are expected to contribute 50 basis points for the full year. COVID-only testing revenues were $8 million in the quarter, which as expected, declined from $76 million last year. Revenue growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 8.1%, respectively. As expected, BD Life Sciences revenues declined due to lower COVID-only testing revenues compared to the prior year. Life Sciences base revenues, which exclude COVID-only testing, were about flat, given the comparison to prior year respiratory testing sales that negatively impacted base growth by about 400 basis points. On an underlying basis, Life Sciences base revenues grew approximately 4%. Total company base revenue growth was strong across all regions with high single-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally, including strong double-digit growth in China. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes an MDS where we continue to drive growth in Vascular Access Management with our BD PosiFlush vascular care and PIVC Catheter Solutions. In Medication Management Solutions, our investments in high-growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth, led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. Our MMS dispensing platform reported double-digit growth, reflecting our continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the BD HealthSight portfolio. And in Pharm Systems [ph], in the higher-growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market, our capacity expansion investments and strong leadership position in pre-fillable solutions with BD Hypak and newer innovations in products such as BD Neopak, BD Effivax and BD Hylok are driving our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while supporting the increased demand in high-growth categories like biologics. Life Sciences base business growth was about flat and approximately 4% underlying when adjusting for the respiratory testing sales comparison. This reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including microbiology, molecular diagnostics and single-cell analysis. It was partially offset by impact of some U.S. distributors destocking in specimen management. In our IDS business, double-digit growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution, including continued adoption of the IdentifA and Total Modular Track Solutions and strong demand for our blood culture and ID/AST reagents. Continued strong growth in molecular IVD assays reflects leverage of BD COR and the incremental BD MAX installed base. In Biosciences, high single-digit growth was driven by our clinical business with strong double-digit growth in cancer reagents, leveraging the growth in our installed base of FACSLyric analyzers and adoption of FACSDuet automation. Performance in Research Solutions reflects continued strong growth in research reagents enabled by our innovative BD Horizon dyes. Strong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including Advanced Repair and Reconstruction, PVD and incontinence, where our newer innovations in high-growth areas are continuing to contribute nicely to growth. Our Surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth driven by continued market adoption of Phasix's hernia resorbable scaffold and our PI business unit, double-digit growth in Peripheral Vascular Disease was driven by broad-based strength across the portfolio, including global penetration of Rotarex. In our UCC business unit, high single-digit growth was driven by strength across the portfolio, including strong double-digit growth of our PureWick solutions for addressing chronic incontinence in both the acute and alternate care settings and double-digit growth in Endourology. Further details regarding each segment's performance in the quarter can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. Now moving to our P&L. We reported Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.96, which included gross margin of 52.6% and operating margin of 23%. Operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year and includes an unfavorable 100 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item that gets recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. Excluding this item, operating [Technical Difficulty] and was ahead of our expectations driven by strong execution against our margin improvement initiatives. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point headwind to both gross margin and operating margin. Gross margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth and the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives that enabled us to overcome 200 basis points of outsized inflation. Our Q3 margin drivers are aligned with what we have been anticipating throughout the year, which is that most of the full year margin improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage. Q3 SSG&A expense increased about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 150 basis points of leverage in SSG&A, which reflects shipping efficiency and good leverage in selling and G&A expense. As expected, R&D as a percentage of sales of 5.9% and normalized back towards our expected full year average of about 6% in Q3, given our spending was over-indexed in the first half. In summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q3 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 200 basis points. Below operating margin, the improvement in other income reflects the offset to the employee benefit-related expense recorded in G&A. Our tax rate in Q3 was 15.7% due to benefits realized that were not previously contemplated. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.7 billion year-to-date, as expected, operating cash flows improved substantially in Q3, including a reduction in inventory from the prior quarter. We anticipate a continued normalization of working capital in Q4, including further improvements in our inventory balance as we trend toward levels that are closer to the prior year. We ended Q3 with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid over $1 billion in debt maturities, utilizing the proceeds from the February debt refinancing. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.9 times. We continue to move towards our net leverage target of 2.5 times. In summary, we executed well against our cash and net leverage improvement goals this quarter. We remain committed to enhancing our cash conversion and net leverage positions and expect more progress in Q4, including benefiting from the net proceeds from the divestiture of our Surgical Instrumentation Platform which will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Starting with our updated revenue guidance before the divestiture of the Surgical Instrumentation Platform. Given our strong third quarter performance, we are raising the midpoint of our base revenue guidance by 25 basis points to 7% and we now expect base revenues to be between 6.8% and 7.1%. This includes increases in the midpoint of both organic and inorganic revenue growth and reflects strong third quarter organic performance as well as inorganic momentum driven by our Parata Pharmacy Automation Solution, demonstrating our strong execution and M&A integration capabilities. Inorganic revenue is now expected to contribute approximately 135 basis points to full year base revenue growth. For the full year, base organic revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 5.8%, which continues to reflect strong fourth quarter organic revenue growth of about 6%. Our guidance continues to include the impact of strategic portfolio exits, which has moderated slightly from our original assumption. Finally, adjusting for the impact of the recently completed Surgical Instrumentation divestiture adjusts our updated base revenue growth guidance by 20 basis points to a range of 6.6% to 6.9% to reflect net inorganic revenue adjustments to base growth of approximately 115 basis points. Our increased base organic revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 5.8% is not impacted. Over a two year period, we are driving strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Our segment-specific growth assumptions have not changed. For COVID-only testing, our guidance only includes year-to-date revenues of $56 million. All in, we expect reported revenues to be approximately $19.3 billion, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion. Regarding the Alaris 510(k) clearance. As previously disclosed, we expect to ramp our return to market in our infusion business over time with our existing customers and remediation taking first priority. As we scale our manufacturing capacity and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to deliver our products in the right way, we are well positioned to engage with customers and execute as quickly as possible. However, we do not expect any material incremental revenue contribution from Alaris for the remainder of FY 2023, and we expect to begin a more regular rhythm of shipment and installation of devices and recognizing revenue as we progress through FY 2024. Within our FY 2023 guidance range, we expect to absorb any initial investments beyond the sales and service organizations we retained to successfully support our return to market. Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full year. We are executing as planned and have line of sight to our targeted margin improvement. Below operating income, our assumption regarding interest other remains unchanged. We have lowered our effective tax rate guidance to be between 13% and 13.5%. The midpoint of our updated tax guidance range is essentially equivalent to our FY 2022 actual effective tax rate of 13.3% and as a result, is not incrementally contributing to FY 2023 EPS growth. Our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12.10 to $12.32 remains unchanged, but reflects absorbing a $0.02 negative impact from the divestiture of our surgical instrumentation platform and a $0.05 negative impact from the latest FX rates. We are raising our base business earnings forecast by $0.07 based on our strong third quarter performance, including consistent execution of our margin goals, offsetting the impact of the divestiture and FX. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect adjusted EPS growth of about 10% to 11.5% and driven by very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14.5% to 16%, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior expectation. As a result, given our strong growth and execution on a year-to-date basis versus our original guidance in November. We've increased our adjusted base business earnings per share by about $0.27, which added 225 basis points to growth, resulting in the 14.5% to 16% growth on our base. This also includes absorbing another year of outsized inflation of about 200 basis points. These strong base business results enabled us to fully absorb an increased earnings headwind associated with the loss of COVID-only revenue as well as lost earnings associated with the recent surgical instrumentation divestiture and still increase our total FXN growth rate by 75 basis points to 10% to 11.5% double-digit earnings growth. As you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. We've outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides. First, our increased organic guidance continues to reflect strong growth of about 6% in Q4. As a reminder, we've now anniversaried the acquisitions of Parata and MedKeeper. Second, as you think about margins, as we've described throughout the year, most of the full year improvement is expected to come from SSG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin, which has been muted year-to-date because of outsized inflation. For operating margin, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. However, versus our last update in May, the amount of expansion needed has been reduced by about 75 basis points, and thus, we de-risked our Q4 delivery. There are several factors driving Q4 operating margin, including expense leverage, on expected strong revenue performance, inflation mitigation actions to offset outsized inflation and cost of goods sold, SSG&A expense reductions driven by the timing of spend and the full quarter impact of our more recent simplification initiatives. Also, R&D as a percentage of revenue will continue to moderate lower to about 5% of sales, resulting in full year spend of about 6%. Finally, there is also a favorable comparison to the prior year reinvestment of COVID-only testing profits. As we look ahead to FY 2024, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our BD2025 strategic and financial goals. While it is premature to commit to specifics, I can offer the following thoughts as we look ahead. As discussed, we continue to operate in a macro environment that remains uncertain and an inflationary environment that has moderated but remains elevated. We are especially focused on monitoring how various governments such as China respond to economic and other dynamics. With that said, med tech in general has proven to be much more durable during times of uncertainty, including economic downturns. And certainly, BD has a proven strategy and has demonstrated not only the ability to be resilient, but to deliver strong growth in earnings during the most challenging times. Our market-leading portfolio, strong innovation pipeline, continued shift into high-growth end markets and track record of execution gives us confidence in delivering against our 5.5% plus target next year. With respect to Alaris, we are excited to shift our focus and reengage with our customers. The clearance of Alaris offers much needed certainty to our stakeholders. As previously noted, it increases our confidence in executing against our BD2025 targets. Just two weeks after clearance, it would be premature to provide a range of expected revenue in FY 2024. However, consistent with what we've shared we expect to ramp revenues back to our pre-ship hold level of approximately $400 million over time. Our focus will be replacing and upgrading pumps for our existing customers. At this juncture, knowing we have some level of Alaris revenue in our FY 2023 base of around $100 million, we would anticipate a modest level of revenue above that, which could result in about a 50 basis point tailwind to growth in FY 2024. As a result, based on current assumptions and the macro environment factors I mentioned we are monitoring, our base growth with Alaris would be approximately 6%. We will share more about other assumptions across our portfolio when we solidify our FY 2024 plans. As a reminder, if you look outside of our base business, in FY 2023, we have realized nearly $16 [ph] million in COVID-only revenue. Based on current dynamics, we would not expect material revenue in FY 2024 and which results in an expected headwind of about 30 basis points that you need to adjust for. Additionally, the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform will have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total growth. This does not impact our organic growth, which should be considered in your total FXN revenue growth. We will true up for currency when we provide FY 2024 guidance in November. Regarding earnings, we remain confident in our double-digit earnings growth profile of about 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. This includes absorbing the reduction to earnings associated with lower COVID-only testing revenue and the divestiture impact. Combined, these items are worth about 125 basis points. We will share more details when we give our guidance, but given we expect to finish FY 2023 at 70% of our 25% operating margin goal by 2025. At this point, we are tracking ahead of our 2025 margin goals. Importantly, this gives us the flexibility to deliver on our margin goals while investing to maximize growth and deliver on our double-digit earnings growth target. As we finalize our plans, we will look at optimizing the ratio of growth versus margin increase that delivers against these goals. In summary, we see our value proposition as differentiated and importantly, have consistently executed against our commitments, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver against our future goals. In closing, we are consistently delivering multiple periods of outsized financial performance. I would like to thank our associates around the world who are working hard to deliver on our purpose and help us achieve these results. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance and our progress towards our BD 2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue? Yes. I think on the margin side, Tom, you covered it well. There was the 80 basis points that we talked about that was historic. Obviously, a lot's changed since then, including moving into an inflationary environment. And as you've seen from our performance, we've been taking a lot of actions in our business to drive margin improvement across the board. But that 80 points will certainly come back. It was always part of our 2025 by 2025 [ph] goals. You should really see that more scale as we're going to be going through kind of think of a ramp period with Alaris. And certainly, even as you think of the front end around margin, right? One, these are dilutive to GP in terms of the BD level, right? So just keep that in mind. And there's going to be investments that we need to make that are incremental above and beyond the investments that we retain. First of all, you do have some variable items such as shipping, communication materials, marketing, customer service, ramp up, all of that. Additionally, in the short term that there's going to be added things. What we're trying to do as we get back. So certainly, it's going to be a contributor. And I would point to our FY 2024, which is obviously preliminary. We're looking at all the market factors that are out there and geopolitical dynamics, et cetera, but we wanted to be prudent and provide some perspective on the momentum we have on 2024 and where we're heading. But you'll notice we committed to around 10% EPS growth, which includes absorbing the divestiture and the further headwinds in terms of COVID-only revenues dropping. So it actually implies a base earnings growth above 11%. Some of that is, of course, the momentum we have in our base business, the margin Alaris. So, I think collectively, you see us getting to those goals and the Alaris margin is certainly part of that. Well, I mean, I think you answered it well. I mean I just \u2013 I think what you talked about is there's the Alaris benefit that gives us a natural glide path to continue to build on momentum we've had the past two years, first two years of our BD 2025 strategy. You could see what we put forth in 2024, and we're talking about base growth of around 6% now, which is I think, an exciting commitment at this juncture. And certainly, it will be a catalyst going forward. And I think beyond to Tom's point, Alaris in itself, but really capitalizing on the full value proposition of our Medical segment. Yes. Just the remediation process is very multifaceted complex. We're working with the agency on this. On a case-by-case basis, it needs to match the 510(k), the cleared and so that's sort of what we're doing. We'll be going out, doing walk-throughs at the customers, customers through COVID may have had mixed fleets of different ages of pumps, things like that. So we need to kind of go on a customer-by-customer basis and in some cases, a pump-by-pump basis. So that's where that stands. We've \u2013 our commitment is mainly to our \u2013 and our priorities for our existing customers that have stuck bias. Something just to go back to the previous question, the run rate at the \u2013 in sort of 2018, 2019, that had a fair amount of competitive position gain. So \u2013 because our Alaris product was being preferred at that time and we were gaining position in the marketplace. Probably in the near-term here, we'll be focused on the remediation and the replacement of our existing customers. So that's something just to think about from a pent-up demand perspective. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes. Regarding margins, to your point, we've executed very strong in a very complex environment, right past two years. We've had over 400 basis points of outsized inflation despite that. We've had nearly 400 basis points of base margin expansion. And so that puts us 70% of the way on track to the 25% goal. So we feel really good about that. If you do sort of the implied kind of math in the next two years, you would need roughly 50 basis points to 75 basis points per year. We don't want to share specifics at this time as it relates to margin profile. There's lots to consider within the P&L. It's obviously early from a guide, but I think what it offers us the way you should think of it is we have a de-risked path to 25% over the next two years. Not only that, it gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to ensure that, to your point, we're balancing an investment posture against continuing to drive outsized top-line growth while still achieving our margin goals. So those will be the puts and takes that we'll think about as we move forward. I think the last comment I would make is, we have a strong profile and pipeline of margin improvement initiatives that have already been underway now for years. So these aren't just numbers that are on a page to get to an outcome. We have detailed plans that get there and detailed plans that are de-risked in a way that we would plan knowing that execution doesn't always happen or you have other headwinds that may happen and gives us confidence to get to that number, but also some of those efficiency plans can be reinvested back in the business, too. So I think it's a very good position to be in, and we'll continue to share more as we get closer to 2024. Yes. And I'm sorry, just one other comment on margins that you made, because I know you mentioned the Q4 exit being, remember, there are some \u2013 which is important as you think of us delivering and our confidence to deliver in Q4. There are some timing dynamics in there, right? The phasing of R&D, we've talked about, there's some phasing in SSG&A. There's some comp dynamics in there. Those are worth between 150 basis points and 200 basis points. So that's not a pure exit rate that you should think of that's hot. The other nice thing is we actually de-risked our Q4 margin versus last guide. It's \u2013 it's about 75 bps depending on how you look at it relative to our last planning stand. So we feel really good about this year then as I shared before, the momentum beyond."

Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. The results we have been delivering for multiple periods reflect our strategy in action. We are now about halfway through our BD 2025 plan to accelerate growth and simplify and empower our company, and I'd like to share how our team's strong execution of our strategy is driving our performance and will enable continued momentum through 2025 and beyond. We have made purposeful and strategic investments, which we're seeing contribute to consistent, higher growth, and strong financial performance. We have been and remain very intentional with how we are deploying our capital towards higher growth spaces and are pleased with the significant progress we continue to make increasing our WAMGR. These actions have evolved BD into an agile, innovative, and durable medical technology company with a compelling growth profile. Our innovation mindset is driving higher product development velocity and super cycles of innovation in many of our businesses. Through a focus on the most impactful programs, improved milestone achievement and launch excellence. To highlight a few examples of our strategy and investments, and how they're fueling strong results and momentum. First in Pharm Systems, due to the start of our BD 2025 journey, we made a bold decision to invest $1.2 billion in additional capacity. Today, we're seeing this capacity investment along with several new innovations we've brought to market, paying off as we are ideally positioned to enable delivery of the large wave of biotech drugs coming to market. We've built Pharm Systems into a $2 billion growth platform with 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. With over 70% of the top 100 biopharma companies using BD's portfolio and 6x the capacity of the nearest competitor we are well-positioned to continue delivering strong growth. Second, during COVID, we also made several strategic reinvestments of certain COVID-only testing proceeds, particularly in our BDB business, which is one of the areas with a super cycle of new breakthrough innovations coming to market over this and the next several years. We've already begun to see acceleration from some of the early new launches notably in biopharma for cell therapy and immune oncology research. Looking forward to the upcoming launch of our FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter. That was previously featured on the cover of the journal Science. The S8 combines advanced spectral flow cytometry with novel CellView Image Technology. By combining the power of high parameter spectral flow cytometry with an unprecedented picture of a cell and its inner workings. We are defining a new standard in flow cytometry, which will empower scientists to unlock life changing discoveries across fields like immunology, cancer research, and cell biology. We recently shipped our first early access BD FACSDiscover S8 and we remain on track for launch later this quarter. We've also already begun launching a new family of [spectrally] [ph] optimized BD Horizon reagents that together with the FACSDiscover S8 will create a unique spectral solution inclusive of instruments, dyes, and informatics that only BD can offer. Third, as you know, we have been very purposeful in increasing tuck-in M&A to drive scale within high growth adjacent markets. And have built strong M&A capabilities to successfully integrate assets. Our most recent acquisition of Parata\u2019s Pharmacy Automation Solutions continues to exceed our expectations and we're already seeing an early impact from revenue synergies. The Parata acquisition expanded our offering to establish BD as a leader in pharmacy automation and created a new growth platform with revenues in excess of $0.5 billion growing double-digits. This is an attractive growing market that uses automation to address a number of the critical issues faced by our customers, such as wage inflation, labor attrition, pharmacist burn-out, and the need to reallocate pharmacist's valuable time to clinical care.  Parata is just one example of the successful tuck-in acquisitions we've made over the last several years. These acquisitions are currently contributing about 30 basis points to our organic growth rate this year. And once Parata annualizes, we expect that contribution will increase to about 50 basis points. Lastly, we continue to build on our strong competency of serially innovating on and expanding the application of new technologies we develop or acquire. This is exemplified in our urology and critical care business, where our acquisition of PureWick continues to provide significant benefits to patients, and is also an impactful growth driver for UCC. We've already launched the home version of PureWick Female, which continues to be very well received and is aligned with our focus on providing solutions and new care settings. And at the end of FY 2022, we launched PureWick Male, the newest product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. PureWick Male provides nurses with a non-invasive option for urine management in men, enabling earlier catheter removal and reduced risk of infection. We are receiving exceptional customer feedback and the adoption of PureWick Male is exceeding our expectations. We have multiple additional R&D programs in the pipeline, to continue to expand our solutions in and incontinence. These are just some of the examples of key investment decisions we have executed to strengthen our business, contributing to our performance today and over the long-term. Turning to our quarterly financial results. We are seeing the strength of our BD 2025 strategy in action across all businesses and geographies in our Q2 performance. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results that exceeded our expectations with 8.7% base revenue growth and double-digit currency neutral earnings growth. But we are excited by what we have achieved to date. We have much more to look forward to. Let me provide a few examples of how we progressed our pipeline this quarter. Starting with our recent launches, in our BD Medical segment, we launched our PowerMe midline catheter in China. And by the beginning of March, it was being used in the first patient. PowerMe was designed by our R&D center in China for China and we're excited about the opportunity it creates to develop a new category of vascular access in China. In our Life Sciences segment, we're really excited about how the BD core platform is expanding us into the high throughput, high growth molecular diagnostics market. In Q2, we received 510(k) clearance for our new Vaginal Panel on BD COR. The world's first microbiome based PCR assay that uses a single swab and test to simultaneously detect the three most common causes of vaginitis infections, enabling targeted cost effective treatment. And in our BDI segment, we launched our Highlander 014 PTA Balloon in Q2. Highlander is the first and only non-compliant fiber based balloon designed to treat peripheral artery disease and below the knee anatomy. We are proud to be leading in this space, building on our history of continuous innovation in the higher growth PVD market. We've also hit several crucial milestones this quarter. These include regulatory submissions of the PIVO Pro and BD Nexiva with NearPort IV Access, which are core elements of our One Stick Hospital Stay and Vascular Access Management strategy in our MDS business. In our biosciences business, we completed the early access program for our BD Rhapsody HT Xpress. And in fact, I'm pleased to report that just in the last few days we announced the launch. The HT Xpress is a single cell analysis system that increases the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform eightfold, while maintaining compatibility with our existing single cell assays and reagents. This new instrument enabled access to the fast growing translational single-cell multiomics market with a high throughput research solution. And in our surgery business, we completed testing for our Phasix ST Umbilical product to support a 510(k) submission later this fiscal year. Phasix ST Umbilical is designed to provide patients reliable, alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of the category leading bio resorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. Phasix ST Umbilical will be the first fully reservable product customized for open umbilical repairs, which represents the majority of umbilical procedures. This is another example of a technology reacquired and are now expanding and accelerating the growth of. These launches and milestones are good examples of how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. While we advance our growth strategy, we also remain focused on our number 1 priority to bring the Alaris pump back to market. We are confident in the resources invested in our submission, the team and leadership task to prioritize this, and that we will get clearance. As we have stated in the past the relaunch of Alaris is included in the BD 2025 strategic plan. And while we cannot predict clearance timelines, we can ensure that we are prepared for the relaunch with the proper operational capacity and functional capabilities so that we can provide our customers with the best experience. As a reminder, we've launched an updated Alaris pump in several international markets and continue to receive very positive feedback from customers. In Q2, we continue to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio, and our operating model. We made further progress on our recode portfolio simplification program, which reduces SKUs in order to improve customer service and focus on the most important products needed to deliver care. We remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, improve cost and service, while delivering on our ESG goals to address climate change and carbon neutrality. Earlier this year, we expanded our recode initiatives to include our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness and simplify our organization to improve Agility. These actions resulted in us reducing our overall headcount by about 2% this year. We also recently made the strategic decision to partner with a leading business process and professional services firm and are transitioning certain BD shared service center business processes. They will be working to optimize our back office processes and services using automation, data, and process excellence that they have implemented very successfully with other large companies. Collectively, our simplification programs are a core part of our strategy to drive efficiency and enable impactful growth. To share some perspective on the macro environment, overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in-line with our view that challenges will persist not escalate. While we're seeing signs of inflation cooling off, it is still more than twice the historical average. We see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles, particularly in our supply chain organization. Across raw materials, some categories such as resins used and finished goods are beginning to show signs of stabilization. But overall, they have not come down universally and remain well above prior cost levels. In terms of supply availability, we have seen significant improvements across materials, supplies and labor, which are driving our back order reduction leading us to recover towards pre-pandemic supply levels. Broadly speaking, we are seeing stabilization and continued overall procedure volume recovery and volume momentum. Specific to China, we delivered strong performance despite some impact from increased COVID cases in the region and reduced hospital capacity that carried into Q2. We experienced a strong recovery in March and remain well-positioned for continued growth in China. Our strategy has proven to enable strong results in some of the most challenging times. And by successfully navigating the macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and remain well positioned to deliver continued strong performance. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'll provide an update on the progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We continue to be proud of our leading focus on reducing the environmental impact of our product portfolio and we recently announced the launch of our new circular economy pilots in several regions, but we are partnering with healthcare facilities and waste management companies to recycle used materials, including BD syringes in the U.S. and BD vacutainers in Denmark. In addition to launching our 2022 cybersecurity annual report in early Q2, we also established the BD Cybersecurity Risk Committee, which serves as the management level governance body for oversight of all Cybersecurity risk across the company. The committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and its members include cybersecurity leaders across enterprise, manufacturing, and product cybersecurity, as well as key functional leaders. We are also proud to receive continued recognition for our ongoing commitment to talent and culture. Most recently, we renamed the noteworthy company for the fourth straight year in Diversity Inc.\u2019s annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity. We look forward to providing further updates on the commitments, disclosures, and progress on the four pillars of our ESG strategy. Company health, planet health, community health, and human health as we publish our 15th annual ESG report later this year. In summary, I'm proud of our progress and the positive impact our associates are delivering for our customers and patients around the world. Our purposeful and strategic investments in attractive end markets are driving higher growth and creating value. Our innovation mindset is improving our pipeline execution and launch excellence and creating the most exciting product pipeline in the company's history. Our simplification efforts are reducing complexity and driving business process excellence and agility. Our increased guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects our strategy and action, strong execution by our team and a strengthened growth profile. We will continue to increase investments to support profitable growth through 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance, and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments our BD 2025 strategy is driving consistent performance and demonstrates our strong growth profile. With our year to date performance, we are well on track to achieve our FY 2025 long-term targets. Beginning with some color on our revenue performance, we delivered strong Q2 base revenue growth of 8.7% or 7% organic. This includes growing over prior year flu COVID combination sales, which negatively impact growth by over 200 basis points and an impact from one-time strategic portfolio exits of about 50 basis points. Adjusting for these impacts, organic volume growth was in the strong mid-single digits at nearly 6%. In addition to the inorganic revenue contribution from M&A, we continue to drive organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter. COVID-only testing revenues were $16 million in the quarter, which as expected declined from 214 million last year. Total company base business growth was strong across BD Medical, and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 9.3% respectively. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 2.2% includes a negative impact of about 800 basis points, due to the comparison to higher combination flu COVID testing sales last year attributable to the Omicron wave, coupled with the timing of this year's respiratory season that peaked earlier than normal during fiscal Q1 and then declined. Base revenue growth was strong across all regions with high-single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally, including 9% growth in China. For the full-year, we expect to deliver high-single-digit growth in China. Our growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core portfolio and our shift into attractive and higher growth end markets. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes our durable core where we continue to drive growth in vascular access management with our BD Posiflush and Catheter Solutions. In Medication Management Solutions, our investments in high growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. In our Dispensing platform, continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the recent launch of BD Pyxis ES 1.7 and the BD HealthSight portfolio drove double-digit growth. And in Pharm Systems in the higher growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market our capacity investments and newer innovations in products such as BD Effivax, BD Hylok, and BD Neopak are driving continued double-digit growth. Strong underlying performance in our Life Sciences segment reflects growth in our durable core in specimen management and execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including single cell analysis, microbiology, and molecular diagnostics. In our IDS business, growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution, including adoption of the recently launched IdentifA and Total Modular Track solutions. Double-digit growth in Molecular IVD assays reflects continued leverage of our large install base. In Biosciences, high teens growth was driven by new innovations, in BD Horizon dyes, and our expanded antibody portfolio that drove double-digit growth in research reagents and continued strong demand for our BD FACSymphony, flow cytometry analyzers. Strong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including advanced repair and reconstruction, PBD, oncology, and incontinence. Our newer innovations in higher growth areas are all contributing nicely to growth. Our surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth with continued market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold, driving double-digit growth in advanced repair and reconstruction, and double-digit growth in biosurgery that was aided by Arista. In our PI business unit, the relaunch of Venovo and global penetration of Rotarex are driving high single-digit growth. In our UCC business unit, high-single-digit growth continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth of the PureWick franchise that was aided by the recent launch of PureWick Male. Across BDI, procedure volumes were also strong in the quarter contributing to growth, particularly in our surgery business unit. Further details regarding each segment's performance in the quarter can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.  Now, moving to our P&L. We reported Q2 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86, which included gross margin of 54.2%, it was slightly ahead of our expectations and operating margin of 22.7% that was in-line with expectations. Our margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth, the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives, and strategic portfolio exits that enabled our ability to more than overcome nearly 200 basis points of outsized inflation, which was in-line with our expectations. Gross margin also reflects negative FX, which was slightly higher than anticipated. SSG&A expense increased 5% year-over-year. Half of the SSG&A increase was driven by the unfavorable impact of an employee benefit related item that gets recorded in G&A and is offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 50 basis points of leverage in SSG&A with shipping growth in-line with revenues and good leverage in selling expense. As expected, our phasing of R&D continues to be weighted to the first half of the year with R&D as a percent of sales of 6.5% in Q2. Our R&D investments are aligned to our long-term growth strategy and have been a catalyst to increased velocity of product development. In summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q2 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 80 basis points, including absorbing a 30 basis point headwind from lower COVID-only testing. Our tax rate in Q2 was lower than anticipated, due to the timing of certain discrete items that were contemplated to occur during the year. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $584 million year-to-date. Operating cash flow reflects an elevated inventory balance that has enabled our strong performance and ability to meet peak demands and support our customers' needs while navigating the complexity of the macro environment. We remain focused on reducing our inventory balance and have several initiatives underway to do so. As a result, while we saw peak inventory levels during the quarter, we exited the quarter with positive progress towards reducing inventory. We expect inventory to continue to decline over the balance of the year with the most prominent reduction expected in Q4 to levels similar to the prior year. We're also driving more effective capital expenditures for the full-year and expect expenditures to be similar to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2 billion, which includes the proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the year. We ended Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 3.1x. We expect to pay down our commercial paper over the balance of the year and move towards our net leverage target of 2.5x. As the year progresses and we build cash, we will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our quarter performance, we are confident in raising the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The strength of our base revenue growth and consistent execution of our margin goals is enabling our ability to offset lower COVID-only testing revenues and the latest FX rates, while reinvesting in the business to drive future growth. Starting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well-positioned for strong growth across our three segments, which are delivering at or above our expectations, and thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 6.5% to 7%. This is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 5.75% to 6.75%, and is driven by our Q2 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our team's continued strong execution and our consistent growth profile. Following our strong FY 2022 growth of 9.4%, we again increased our revenue guidance in FY 2023, which at the midpoint brings our two-year average growth to about 8% or 7% organic, which is well above our 5.5% plus target. Increased base revenue guidance includes both higher organic and inorganic growth expectations for the full-year. We now expect inorganic revenue to contribute approximately 125 basis points of base revenue growth for the full-year, which is an increase of 25 basis points, driven by the strong execution of Parata. Organic based revenue growth is now expected to be 5.25% to 5.75%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. Both our base revenue and base organic revenue growth continue to include a reduction of approximately 100 basis points, resulting from our planned one-time strategic portfolio exits. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in-line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comparisons and Interventional to be above the total company range. For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $50 million to $100 million, driven by the reduced testing volumes as a result of the early peak and rapid decline of the respiratory season. All-in, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $50 million at the midpoint to a range of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion, compared to $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion previously. Regarding Alaris, we continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in-line with fiscal 2022 demand. Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full-year. We are executing as planned and the actions required for the year to drive margin improvement remain unchanged. Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with the significant simplify actions in place, including the previously planned operating model programs that we recently announced, gives us the confidence that we will again deliver meaningful margin expansion this year, while absorbing about 200 basis points of outsized inflation and the incremental decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile. Below operating income, our assumptions regarding interest other remains unchanged, and we have narrowed our effective tax rate guidance to 13.25% to 14%. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.10 and $12.32, which represents an increase of $0.015 at the midpoint. This reflects a base business increase of $0.115 that is driving our ability to offset incremental headwinds of approximately $0.05 each from COVID-only testing and foreign currency. Our adjusted EPS guidance reflects currency-neutral growth that is around double digits and within a range of approximately 9.5% to 11%. This includes very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14% to 15.5%, which is over 100 basis points higher than we previously anticipated and is driving our ability to absorb the decline in COVID-only testing. Our updated guidance reflects significant progress towards delivering the BD 2025 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day, including: a strong two-year organic base revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our 5.5% plus long-term target; at least 380 basis points or about 70% of our targeted 540 basis points of base operating margin expansion toward our targeted 25% margin levels in FY 2025; and a strong high-teens two-year base business EPS CAGR, which is also well above our double-digit long-term target. As we think of fiscal 2023 phasing, let me provide some comments for you to consider as you model out the balance of the year. We've outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note. First, regarding base revenues, the midpoint of our updated guidance continues to reflect strong organic growth of about 6% in the second half of the year. We expect organic growth to be fairly ratable over the quarters with some different prior year comparisons in each quarter. As a reminder, we will anniversary the inorganic contribution from the Parata and MedKeeper acquisitions in Q3, which means that Q4 base revenue will be all organic. Second, as you think about margins, as we have described throughout the year, most of the full-year improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin, which is muted because of outsized inflation in fiscal year 2023. We've seen that play out over the first two quarters where gross margin was slightly below the prior year margin in Q1 and slightly above in Q2. We expect a similar dynamic in Q3 where you should be slightly ahead of the prior year's 52.6%. For operating margin, our expectation is for Q3 year-over-year margin improvement, similar to our full-year operating margin expansion expectation and slight improvement sequentially from the 22.7% in Q2. R&D as a percent of revenue will moderate down towards our expected full-year average of about 6% in Q3, while Q4 will be the low at about 5% of sales. Lastly, the midpoint of our full-year effective tax rate guidance indicates an estimated tax rate of about 16.5% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly in Q3 and Q4 as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict. In closing, as we approach the halfway point, our BD 2025 strategy has consistently delivered multiple periods of strong financial performance. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance and our progress towards our BD 2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please?\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, I wanted to ask on guidance. This is the second quarter in a row where you guys have had a really good performance on the top line, beat, and raised guidance, But on the bottom line, we're seeing guidance go up again by a little less than the beat on the bottom line. So, maybe spend a minute and talk through some of the puts and takes and how you're thinking about managing the rest of the year in guidance to be able to offset any headwinds. And it'd also be great \u2013 it looks like FX isn't changing on the top line, but it's getting worse on the bottom line. So, maybe throw that in there as well.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It's Chris. Appreciate the question. I think this is pretty straightforward. So first, just look, another strong quarter and our second increase in guidance, to your point. On revenue, we increased from 6.5% to 7% or 50 basis points on our base. So, at the midpoint, that's 6.75%. And I think important to note, right, our two-year average growth now, 8% or even 7% when you strip out the benefit from tuck-in M&A, so on a pure organic basis. So, really strong, well above our 5.5% profile. As you think of the increase, basically the increase in revenue 100% matched the outperformance in Q2. The way to think of that, if you recall last quarter, we communicated that our second half growth rate would be 6.6. That stayed intact. So, we're holding it to 6.6. Importantly, as you think of the first half to the second half, actually, the organic revenue growth accelerates from 5 to 6, and again, nicely above our 5.5% plus. So, really strong revenue story following a strong FY 2022. On earnings, where I think the core of your question is, so, one, building on the strong growth. We continue to execute against our margin goals. Hopefully, that hasn't gotten lost in this macro environment where you're seeing many in multiple industries with margins declining. So, we're committed to the 100 basis points of margin improvement. We had slight improvement in the quarter. So that holds intact. So basically, the way to think of the raise, you have to, kind of break it down and really understand the base business. So, on the base business, as we noted in the presentation, we raised by [$0.115] [ph]. It exactly equals, kind of margin drop-through on the 90 million increase on our base revenue. And then you noticed we slightly modified our \u2013 the midpoint of our tax guide. So, the revenue accounts for about 60% of it, the tax accounts for the best. I think also important to note, we're not getting any year-over-year benefit on tax. It's actually still a year-over-year headwind that's absorbed in our full-year guidance. So, I think it reflects really strong base performance. And I think another important reminder \u2013 so anyway, that $0.115, it basically absorbs two factors. You noticed that we moderated down the COVID-only testing by about $25 million. That has a strong drop-through in the margin because there's very little commercial investment. It has a higher GP, as we've shared in the past. So, we more than absorbed that. And then we did absorb some FX pressure on EPS, which was pretty modest. That was $0.05 in lieu of actually dropping for FX like we normally do and adjusting our guide range. It was $0.05. We absorbed that on the strong base performance. FX, there was a little bit \u2013 if you remember in the quarter, the dollar strengthened significantly and the euro recovered. So, you actually have to look at the average in the quarter. So, there was a little bit in the quarter with the euro. You also had the yuan and the yen were the other two currencies. So, just modest impacts there. Net-net, it's a raise by [$0.015] [ph] at the midpoint. And then I think the most important thing for everyone to keep in mind, when you just look at our base EPS growth year-over-year, knowing that we're absorbing significant year-over-year declines in COVID-only testing, our actual EPS growth on the base business is nearly 15%, well above our double-digit EPS. So, we feel really good about where we sit, the halfway through the year. We haven't changed any of our, kind of core commitments around margin. With that said, we want to make sure we solidify the future. We want to keep investing. We continue to invest in R&D at higher levels. And this isn't about one quarter, one year. We think this is \u2013 what you're seeing here is a great growth story play out that will happen over multiple periods and will be durable.\nRobbie Marcus: Really helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. I could probably anticipate your answer here, but given the focus, any updates on Alaris or upcoming data points or catalysts we can be looking out for on the pathway to approval?\nTom Polen: Hey, Robbie, good morning. This is Tom. Obviously, as we've discussed many times, getting Alaris back on the market is our number 1 priority. And we are confident in the resources that we have invested in our submission and the team and leadership tasked to prioritize this. As you expected and as we've said before, we're confident in our process and that we will get clearance, and we have been and want to remain prudent and thoughtful about the process with the FDA. And so therefore, we continue to not try to predict exact time lines just given how inherently complex these submissions are. So, obviously, once we get clearance, we'll immediately communicate at that point, and that has been and remains our strategy there. But we're fully focused on making sure that our number 1 job is making sure that the FDA has all the information they require to clear the product. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I think two for you. One, I just wanted to start at a high level, and congrats on a nice quarter here. The super cycle of new products you talked about, how are you feeling about your target of 5.5% organic growth beyond 2023? Chris mentioned a few times that the two-year CAGR for organic growth is 7% this year. So, could that 5.5% be higher beyond this year? And I had one follow-up.\nTom Polen: Okay. Good morning, Larry and thanks for the great question. Great to connect as always. We're extremely excited about the pipeline that we have and our outlook going forward. We're not looking to adjust our long-term commitment at this time, but we are feeling very positive about the momentum that we have as you described. I think as we look at where we are today, what stands out, and hopefully it became clear in our discussions this morning, are the number of high-growth platforms that we've built and that we've continued to systematically progress across the company. And we talked about a few of those. Whether or not it's Pharm Systems, which is now the 11th quarter in a row of double-digit growth, and the macro environment of now biologics being \u2013 more biologics being in pharma's pipeline and small molecules today, first time in history, and some big blockbuster products coming down the pipe. And we are well-positioned as the leader in injectable drug delivery to benefit from that trend with the significant capacity we've added, as well as the innovation pipeline we have, both for professional delivery, but also enabling wearables and self-injection products that we've been investing in are coming to market now as well. Pharmacy automation, right now, a $500 million-plus platform growing in the teens. Huge trends that are going to continue to fuel that going forward, labor shortages, the need for pharmacists to move more front of the \u2013 front-off to be serving patients doing wellness checks, et cetera, we're going to continue to see strong demand for pharmacy automation, and we're really pleased with that platform that we've built. B2B, huge super cycle of innovation there. The FACSDiscover, we've started shipping to the early adopter sites and really a tremendous opportunity to help bring new insights and new discoveries in the areas of cell therapy and immuno-oncology and just understanding the immune system overall. When you think about who is getting Nobel Prizes in those fields that I just described, almost all of them were using flow cytometry. And I'm convinced you're going to see a whole new set of discoveries being uncovered with the new technologies that we're rolling out there right now. Really excited. And of course, that's complemented not only on the capital side with FACSDiscover. And the product we're launching now is just the first in a whole family that we're going to be continuing to roll-out. We're rolling out the high-end sorter first, but we're going to be offering mid-and-lower-end sorters or cell analyzers, utilizing that same technology over the next several years. That's complemented by our new die portfolio and expanding antibody portfolio, as well as informatics technologies that we have launched and will continue to launch. BD Interventional, you heard us talk about a number of great growth platforms that have been developed there, and we're seeing good strong growth out of the BDI segment. This was another strong quarter there. And you're seeing a number of the acquisitions that we've done over the last few years or had done just before BD and Bard came together, things like PureWick and the [indiscernible] innovation that's happening there, TIFA, which we acquired over the last few years and how we're expanding that into new applications, we gave an example of umbilical hernia. Straub Medical and how that's being expanded globally. And you're seeing the benefits of that in the PI business. We're really pleased with the growth momentum that's happening there. And of course, medication delivery, a continuing strong growth in our portfolio there from catheters to picks and eventually through our planning horizon and our aim to get Alaris back on market. So, we're really pleased with the momentum. We're really pleased with the launches we've done to date. We've had about 10 key launches so far this fiscal year that's coming off of 25 key launches last year. And we continue to be on track for about that same number again this year and pretty much every year as we look forward. Thanks for the question.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's super helpful. Just one quick follow-up on Robbie's question on Alaris. It's great to hear the confidence you expressed today. My question is, are you confident you can get it within the \u2013 I know you're not talking about specifics, but within the BD 2025 plan? And I know you have 80 basis points of margin improvement in the \u2013 for Alaris in the BD 2025 plan. If you don't have it within that time line, can you \u2013 do you have other ways to offset the margin leverage you're expecting from it? Thank you.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Larry. I'll take that one. Yes, to your point, if you recall, given that we made the decision to maintain investment in service, field support, et cetera, there was about that 80 basis point headwind to our margin as part of Alaris. We've been very clear, while we haven't been \u2013 said we weren't going to predict timing, we did say as part of our FY 2025 plan. The good thing about margin, and just if you step back again, we delivered 50% of our goal, right, through FY 2022. We're on-track this year. That would put us 70% towards our goal. We have multiple levers to deliver both. In essence, the way we think of it is how do we get to double-digit EPS growth on a consistent basis. We're not dependent on one variable. And given 70% of the way there, we feel really good between the strong growth profile that we expect to continue and natural leverage you get. The Recode initiatives we put in place, that will continue to accelerate through the back half of the year. We just announced kind of the third leg of Project Recode, operating model simplification. Those have been announced, continuing to drive portfolio mix as we've been doing. So, there's a host of things that I think give us confidence and the ability to actually, sort of navigate the balance between top line growth and margin improvement as we continue to progress through the back half of the year while delivering on both commitments, the 25% margin and double-digit EPS growth. So, I think we're really well-positioned when you think of it that way, gives us a lot of flexibility.\nTom Polen: And just to add to Chris, as good comments is \u2013 so Alaris is included in our strategic plan. There's many other levers we have as mentioned. But we have been, as we've shared before, preparing so that when we do get Alaris clearance eventually, that we'll be well-positioned to serve our customers, right? And so, we've talked about that increased inventory levels that we've done on certain components, et cetera. We've talked about the continued investments we have, kept in service in our selling organization so that when clearance eventually comes, that we can both remediate the pumps that are on the market quickly, as well as support additional customers. So, thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice sprint here. My first one is for you. Appreciate all the colors, I think, on pharma, new product cycles, but can you just simplistically outline, what are the categories here that BD is gaining share? It looks like in a pharma, life science, flow cytometry, surgery within hernia, vascular. There's a number of categories. It feels like BD is gaining share. Is that true? And how sustainable is that? And within Life Sciences, any concerns on emerging biopharma funding cycles?\nTom Polen: Yes. Great question, Vijay, and appreciate the comments. So, we'll go around. We've got the segment presence here in the room. I think you're right. What you're seeing is outperforming market growth rates in a number of categories, and we're really pleased with that, driven really through strong innovation, capacity investments that we've made and strong execution. Why don't we start with the Medical segment and Mike can speak to what we're seeing in both Pharm Systems, but also pharmacy automation and medication management overall.\nMike Garrison: Yes. Thanks for the question. There's three sort of growth drivers that we've built in Medical. First, Pharm Systems, as Tom mentioned in the opening comments, 11 straight quarters of double-digit growth. And both the combination of our capacity investments, which we built a few years ago and continue to implement, plus our innovation, really to support the sensitive biologics and the requirements that those \u2013 that pipeline has coming towards us. We feel really good about that durable growth continuing. In MMS, we're really happy with the way that the teams have come together in pharmacy automation and our dispensing business. That connected med management and the tie around clinical efficiency both in the hospital as the hospitals start to shift care outside of the hospitals and how that ties into the retail markets, the long-term care markets. This is just a really ripe area for innovation, and we're really well-positioned now with that acquisition. It's going really well. And then in MDS, the Vascular Access Management strategy continues to do really well. Continues to resonate with customers, especially those aspects where it makes both the patient experience and the clinical experience a positive one. And so, we see \u2013 we don't necessarily look at it in terms of market position. We don't really comment on that. But we do look at it in terms of our WAMGRs. And we tend \u2013 we're showing growth over WAMGR. So, we feel good in that area as well. I'll turn it over to Rick or Dave.\nRick Byrd: Great. So thanks, Mike. Thanks, Vijay, for the question. And Tom, for the opportunity to talk about BDI. So, first off, really pleased with the results in the quarter, 9.3% growth overall with all businesses contributing. And like you said, you pointed out surgery at almost 14%. And so, this strong performance across the segment really reflects the execution of our growth strategy across those key end markets that Chris pointed out, advanced repair and reconstruction, PVD, oncology, incontinence, and our newer innovations in higher growth areas are all really contributing nicely to growth. So, in UCC, we continue to see the growth of the PureWick franchise, aided by the recent launch of PureWick Male. PureWick continues to have really a strong presence in the acute and the alternate care setting for us for chronic incontinence and surgery. Like you said, growth is really driven by continued market adoption of Phasix, our hernia resorbable scaffold. Biosurgery growing double digits, aided by Arista. So, really good there. And then finally, in PI business, we're really \u2013 we're seeing improvements across our global supply chain as well as benefits of a lot of the strategic investments that we've made in the past. We have strong global penetration of Rotarex. We're really pleased with the relaunch of Venovo. And then our global expansion strategy is paying off, oncology in China is really strong. So, we feel confident with the overall external market conditions, including the recovery of elective procedures, improving their supply chain. And then you combine that with the success of, again, the strategic investments we've made, whether they be tuck-in M&A or products like as Tom mentioned, Rotarex, Phasix or with our new product launches such as PureWick Male. Team is executing extremely well, and we believe we have the right strategy to drive continued success.\nTom Polen: And maybe just to add to Rick's good comments there. I think something that stands out for particularly the PI business is a number of the investments and new launches that are happening there are in entirely new markets for BD. And so, they're almost exclusively share gains that are happening that are driving growth, right?  So, you think about atherectomy and thrombectomy, that's 100% share gain. I think about the Venclose acquisition that we did and the growth that's coming from that, that's all share gain because we hadn't been in the category. And of course, Venovo stent, we have been off the market. And so, the relaunch of that is regaining \u2013 is all regaining market share. And just to more specifically address that question very as well, and maybe, Dave?\nDave Hickey: Yes, for sure. Vijay, it's Dave. Great question. So, again, I mean, just to reiterate for the segment. So, I mean, as you saw in the in the release, just a tremendous strong quarter for BDB at 18.7% and even good core growth in IDS, if you strip away the headwind from the 800 bps of respiratory climb over from same period last year. I'll maybe pick a couple of highlights. I mean, in BDB, we continue to see really strong growth across the board, whether it's the Life Science research reagents, clinical reagents, the demand for the new instruments. Actually, from a Life Science research reagent perspective, so this is the dyes, the Horizon dyes that Tom talked about, that's actually our tenth successive quarter of double-digit growth now. You've heard us talk about BD Max before, which was obviously instrumental in the COVID, sort of pandemic from a respiratory perspective. But how do we now leverage the BD Max for take-up of IVDs and assay utilization and assay penetration? And again, we continue to see really good growth in molecular reagents, eight successive quarters of IVD double-digit growth, which is great. And then maybe on the automation side, we \u2013 when you think about the staffing challenges that the labs are facing, we're really starting to see the traction for BD Kiestra, BD COR that Thomas talked about.  If you think \u2013 you asked a specific question on the sustainability and the customers relative to BDB. The good thing about BDB and just the breadth of platform and reagents that we have is, we've got a very strong diversity of customer base, so not just by a pharma, for sure biopharma, but academia, large academic medical centers, big research institutions. So, I think the diversity of base really helps us there and the types of research that they're doing, right? So, you think about cell therapy, gene therapy, immuno-oncology, all the stuff in terms of fighting that chronic disease in oncology. So, I think we feel really good about that base. And then from that sustainability, I was just reflecting back as we were getting ready for today, and when you look at the segment overall, even for the first half of this year, we've actually had two PMA supplements approved and eight 510(k)s in the first 6 months of this year. So, that all builds to the momentum as we go forward here. Hope that helps.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for that comprehensive answer. And just one quick on gross margin. Chris, is a gross margin performance in the [Q], despite 200 basis points of inflation impact, should we think of back half or third quarter being at or above second quarter levels?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. So, a couple of things. One, if you remember, from a full-year standpoint, we're absorbing over 200 basis points. It's a second consecutive year of inflationary pressures. It was actually more prominent in the first half of the year. It will abate some combination of some moderation of inflation, coupled with, of course, the cost improvement actions and mitigation actions that we're taking in the second half. So, we expected modest improvement in GP through from a full-year standpoint. So, I think you would expect basically similar, to be slightly ahead of our Q3 FY 2022 gross margin, which was 52.6%. So, you'll see slight improvement. And then that will further expand as we move into Q4. But we're right on track. And I think the other thing to point out is, remember, we have about five months of inventory that flows through our sales. So, we have a strong line of sight to basically the inflation that is sitting in that inventory, all the cost improvement that has actually been driven that's part of that inventory cost. And as that sells through in the back half of the year, it gives us strong confidence in our cost base to achieve those goals.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: Hey good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on a strong quarter here. I wanted to just \u2013 I want to go back to the guidance, Chris, if we could, just because there had been some changes. And I know, Robbie touched on this earlier. But maybe just to clarify a bit further on the bottom line just because a sensitivity around beats and raises this quarter is so significant, it seems.  So, if I remember correctly, last quarter, a significant part of the raise was, sort of an FX tailwind. There was also the lower COVID \u2013 higher margin COVID headwind as well. But sort of a big part of that lift, offsetting that was an FX tailwind. In this quarter, you've actually got another [indiscernible] FX headwinds that you're absorbing. Is that the right way to think about, sort of the relative puts and takes last quarter or this quarter?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, that's correct. Just one comment on FX, which is interesting, right. Our fiscal period starts earlier. We actually \u2013 our original guide started at the peak of the strength of the U.S. dollar, right? So, we had significant FX pressure when we gave our initial guide. And to your point, in Q1 the dollar weakened a bit. We adjusted up similar to most companies reporting sort of their first fiscal year. And so, we reversed a lot of that unfavorability in the quarter, gave that back. The base was strong, the base EPS actually expanded, and to your point, offset \u2013 we had a takedown in our COVID-only testing in Q1. This quarter is a little bit different. Again, you had strong base EPS. We actually raised by $0.115. It was offset by two things. Again, another $0.05 on the COVID-only testing dynamics, taking that down a bit to how we see the full year given that those dynamics and market has softened significantly, and then a little bit of FX pressure for the reasons I noted previously. So, net of those two items, it's [$0.015] [ph], but I will go back to just what I shared. So again, when you look at our base business, absorbing all the COVID-only year-over-year testing impacts, our base EPS is growing almost 15%, and that's while absorbing over 200 basis points of inflationary pressures. I think it's somewhat unprecedented performance in this environment. We're delivering really strong growth. And we want to make sure that we're maintaining investments to also continue this type of performance well into the future. So, that's how to think of it. Hopefully, that helps.\nTom Polen: I think just to add to Chris' comment, obviously, the update here has COVID essentially out for the balance of the year, right? So, the number that we have now in COVID guidance is basically the COVID number that we have year-to-date.\nChris DelOrefice: The other, just given those FX dynamics, right, when FX improved, we only had three quarters to go, right? So when we cycle into our fiscal Q1, which is calendar Q4, there will actually be FX tailwind based on where spot rates are today. There's a lot of moving parts to calculate that directly. But on top line, it could be $75 million to $100 million. So, when you look at other people's guide that has a full true calendar year, that's included. We picked that up next year in ours.\nMatt Miksic: Got it. That's super helpful. And the slides are also really helpful material to, sort of walk through this stuff. The other \u2013 again, on guidance on the top line. So, you did make a change, as you pointed out, you're expecting a heavier contribution, positive contribution from your inorganic adds, if you will specifically. And so, I know that last quarter, I don't want to say controversy, but there was this question of you have inorganic adds and you have a portfolio exits, which are basically discontinued products not sold to another company, but coming out of the \u2013 coming out of your revenue build.  And the way I think you were describing it was those things are, kind of offsetting each \u2013 not exactly organic, but we're thinking about it organically. And I would agree with that. Now, you sort of shifted back to more traditional organic description, but you're still sitting those 100 basis points of portfolio exits. So, even though it's $5.25 to $6.25, it is \u2013 it seems to be a little bit stronger on the base business on the organic side. Is that a fair way to read the strength on the top line?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, yes, exactly. The simple way to think of it is, so our all-in guide that includes the negative impact of portfolio exits and the positive impact of organic is [675] [ph] at the midpoint, right? But even if you strip out just the M&A contribution, we're still at 5.5 at the midpoint. Now, that's not taking any credit for the strategic portfolio exits. That was purely just to make sure you guys had context to \u2013 we were taking that bold action, it's helping improve margin given the strong growth profile we have. So, when you think of pure underlying against all the businesses we're investing in, if you want to adjust for that, that's about a point that would take it back up to that same range. But even if you get zero credit for that, our organic growth is 5.5%. And more importantly, our two-year, right, coming off a really strong year, we're 7% organic. None of those numbers give us a positive adjustment for those one-time strategic portfolio exits.\nTom Polen: And I think we're seeing the benefits. Obviously, given the strength of the business, taking those actions on that portfolio is exactly the \u2013 it's the right time to be doing that. As a reminder, those products that we're just exiting have less than half of the average GP of the company. They're growing much less than the average of the company and are in areas that are just not strategic in terms of relevant growth platforms as we go forward. And so, they also come with operational efficiency benefits, organizational efficiency benefits, et cetera. And so, they're just going to make us that much stronger as we go forward and make sure that we're focusing our resources and investments in those areas that move the needle the most for customers and for us.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. And the other \u2013 just one last comment. You mentioned Parata and the strength there. This is a little unique, right? You get the sort of onetime adjustment for what you acquired. This is a great example of us just strong execution in revenue synergies and taking up that forecast. So, again, I think it's just illustrative of how we're managing, kind of tuck-in and the benefits we're generating from that. As we anniversary Parata, the contribution from all the tuck-in acquisitions we will do on an organic basis, it will add about 50 basis points of growth to our portfolio as we exit this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris DelOrefice: Good morning and thank you for taking the question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for the taking the questions. A couple of miscellaneous things all at once. What was the impact of price in the quarter? If you stop planned exits, does that mean your organic revenue growth rate goes up 100 basis points? And is there a plan to stop planned exits? And then bigger picture, there were a lot of BD Veritor\u2019s and BD MAX\u2019s, et cetera, placed or sold during the pandemic for testing? What happens to all of those now? And how do you increase utilization on them for other things? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Okay. Great question. Why don't we start on the first two with Chris and then Dave can take for the Veritor, MAX.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. So, pricing, Joanne, so the Q will come out this evening and we \u2013 aftermarket. And pricing will be disclosed in there as we consistently have. What we've shared is it's the last thing we think about, right, as it relates to inflation mitigation. And so, what we're really focused on is driving cost improvement, portfolio mix, the strength of growth and volume leverage. All of those dynamics are significant contributors to mitigating the 200 basis point inflation. You'll probably see something consistent in terms of what we've done last year. If you think of how last year played out, it accelerated through the year. But you'll be able to see that at the end of the day. In terms of portfolio, I mean, the simple answer to the question is, these were onetime in nature. There's always smaller adjustments you make in your portfolio, but we made a decision to really take a deep look at our portfolio this year, as Tom described. These weren't strategic products. There's market alternatives. The GP profile is significantly reduced. Removing these freeze up capacity and other costs. All of those products, not being sure they still require quality support, regulatory support, there's a lot of tie up as it relates to shipping and thinking of other infrastructure support. So, there's benefit beyond just the GP lift you get. But to answer your question simply, yes, if we stopped doing that, our results would have been better by roughly 100 basis points this year. This quarter was a little light. It was closer to 50 basis points in the quarter. But from a full-year, we're still estimating about 100 basis points. We do view these as one-time in nature this year. We don't anticipate doing that in the future beyond smaller things that we would just absorb and not even talk about.\nTom Polen: Yes. And obviously, we continue to focus on delivering on our 5.5% plus, but as Chris said, we do not have plans to do that again. These are very discrete products. We've given some examples before things like [indiscernible] or washing instruments for orthopedic procedures that, again, we just don't have a relevant role in those spaces and so we've exited those revenues. And we would not see that repeating in the future. Just one thing as you see price after the close of the market today, just to reinforce a comment that Chris made in the opening comments is that we did see very strong volume this quarter as we think about price and volume and the role of those two together. As we look at volume, we look at it organic volume, and then we take out flu-COVID sales as well, right? Because that's something that's not really indicative of, kind of our ongoing business. And when you look at that organic volume growth, excluding COVID-flu, it's strong mid-single digits, nearly 6% overall volume in the quarter. And so, that's something you'll also see as those further reports come out, something very positive that we're continuing to see across the business. When it comes to Veritor and MAXs, I know Dave had made some earlier comments about the very strong double-digit growth that we continue to see in MAX reagent absorption. But why don't you share some more color on that?\nDave Hickey: Yes, Joanne, thanks for the question. And you're right. I mean, through the pandemic, obviously, Veritor and BD MAX installed base did increase. We've not given specifics around exactly what those numbers are. We're very pleased. We continue to ship those platforms today. And if I break it down, so for Veritor right now, a lot of our focus is actually on converting the emergency authorizations that we got for COVID and our combination assays to 510(k). And obviously, once that is done, that would leave the Veritor, if you like, with approved assays for flu A, flu B, COVID, RSV, Strep A, which will really create a really nice anchor point of care clearway platform for infectious disease testing. So that is our focus there. For BD MAX, one of the big benefits of that platform that labs sees an attribute is its complete sample-to-answer automation and integration within a two to three hour window from sample to result. We placed many MAXs during the pandemic just for COVID and combination testing. And then when you think about the rest of the menu, we're now starting to drive adoption of our regular IVD assays. So, there are really two strategies. One is to increase assay utilization and assay penetration of our regular IVDs onto that BD MAX installed base and where we got emergency use authorization on BD MAX during the pandemic, like our quad assay for BD MAX, moving those EUAs to 510(k) as well. And [it's that] [ph] IVD traction and momentum that you've seen us sort of perform eight quarters double-digit growth.\nChris DelOrefice: Thank you for the question, Joanne.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is open. \nChris DelOrefice: Good morning, Rick.\nRick Wise: Hey, Tom. Hi, Chris. Listen, I'm just listening to everything you're saying today, and I keep hearing you both say in many different ways that \u2013 and Chris said it, you're well on track to hit your fiscal 2025 long-term targets. Gosh, I accept it. I believe. I think this quarter supports that notion. So, my question is, is it right for us to believe, and I feel like everything you're saying today is suggesting it, that you're now approaching sustainably perhaps a 6% plus top line territory? Is it right for us \u2013 again, I accept that you're going to hit the 25 and 25 on the operating margin. My question on operating margin is more, how are you getting ready, Tom, it's a crazy question, for the next target, which I think it's going to be 30%? I don't know if it's \u2013 if that's going to take another 5 years. But is that conceptually the wrong way to think about what you're trying to do, where Becton is going? And maybe just as part of that, you're role in your \u2013 just your latest thoughts on the role that tuck-in M&A is going to play? You're doing all these great things internally. What role is tuck-in M&A going to play in this journey? Thank you.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, Rick, and it's a good question. We're focused obviously on continuing to execute our strategy, and we are very pleased with our progress, both on our portfolio and the reshaping that we've been doing. Of course, that includes an \u2013 and Embecta spin just not that long ago as well, which we're pleased with how that's turned out and is allowing each organization to focus. As we look ahead, I'll just go back to the growth platforms that we've been systematically building and are continuing to gain momentum in, right? We talked about areas like Pharm Systems, like pharmacy automation, like BDB flow cytometry, innovation super cycle, like our Interventional Solutions, our Medication Delivery Solutions and our continued innovation focus, our continued outperforming of WAMGR and how we've been supplementing that with strong tuck-in M&A that, as Chris mentioned, as Parata anniversaries this summer, we'll be contributing 50 basis points of underlying growth. We continue to have a very strong funnel, we continue to be exclusively on tuck-in. M&A has been part of our strategy. And obviously, we've been very focused. Mike and team have been heads down executing the integration of Parata exceptionally well. To see revenue synergies this early in the game is quite unique. And just as a reminder, that was accretive to our operating margins right from the start, and they're getting expense synergies going now as well, too, right, which only improves that dynamic. So, we're really happy with how we've been executing tuck-in M&A, the capabilities that we've \u2013 and track record that we've developed there, which gives us the right to continue to make that an important part of our strategy as we go forward. And I think we've talked about in the past, this is really a new lever for BD, right? We're a 125-year-old company. And tuck-in M&A had not been a systematic part of our strategy historically. Obviously, back in 2015, you saw the beginning of two large transformational M&A deals. We obviously did not do tuck-in M&A during that period of time as all the cash was going to pay down debt. And so, this era where we've done quite a number over the last three years, how you're seeing those build systematically stronger business profiles and growth platforms and how we're going to continue with our focus on cash and profitability to drive that going forward is a new part of our equation that's complemented by our strong organic innovation. One thing we didn't mention on this call is \u2013 although we've been talking about historically is that when it comes to innovation, we've made really strong progress in improving our on-time launches and our on-time milestone delivery, getting into the top quartile. And we had exited FY 2022 with our best ever performance. We're beating FY 2022 again in the first half of this year, right? So, we're hitting new records and on-time milestone delivery and on-time launches. And so, we're getting that productivity out of our organic investments as well, which is really positive as we look ahead. When it comes to margin, and Chris can jump in further to this, yes, we feel confident in our 25% margin by 2025, and we've talked about that. It could be opportunity to exceed that, and we would make decisions on do we let that flow through or do we further invest that? I think our first priority will continue to be making sure that we invest in strong growth. We have a lot of exciting opportunities and markets that we participate in. We've described a number of them the day on the call and have been discussing them for some time. We're going to continue to invest behind that, creating a durable growth organization that's supporting, transforming the future of health care in the areas that we've consistently talked about around smart connected care, around enabling the shift, the new care settings and around improving outcomes for patients with chronic disease. And so that's our focus. Let's get to 25% margin first, and then we can look at optionalities from there. Chris, any other?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Just maybe a few small adds. I mean, one, look, I do think the value proposition that BD offers is unique. And we're not changing in our commitments. We talked about 5.5 plus, but to your point, what's been clear, right, our two-year growth, 7% organic. We're clearly in the plus side of the equation. I think for all the reasons Tom noted, we have a portfolio that has the ability that we want to continue to try and drive the plus. But our commitment is 5.5%. I think the nice thing about that is that is maybe underappreciated. There's very few companies in med tech that can deliver that outsized growth, but still have this nice durable profile. It's very de-risked. So, you get this benefit of strong mid-single digits, it's extremely reliable, while we're posting outsized growth and improving margin in a very complex environment and haven't even fully capitalized maybe on some of the levers Tom talked about, like the firepower we'll have with tuck-in M&A going forward, or margin, really, I'll go back to \u2013 we're committed to double-digit earnings growth, which isn't easy to do. Obviously, we can moderate that depending on the growth profile, what we want to make sure we do is, consistently invest in the right areas to drive that growth, right? We continue to increase R&D, et cetera. So, all those factors would be sort of contemplated, but certainly confident in double-digit EPS growth, being able to consistently do that. So, I think it's a nice balance of you're seeing an inflection in growth and really strong growth that's differentiated. You're seeing differentiation and execution and you have a de-risked portfolio. It's hard to find all those pieces. It should make people feel good.\nRick Wise: Thanks to you both.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks for the question, Rick.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. This does conclude this audio webcast. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. The results we have been delivering for multiple periods reflect our strategy in action. We are now about halfway through our BD 2025 plan to accelerate growth and simplify and empower our company, and I'd like to share how our team's strong execution of our strategy is driving our performance and will enable continued momentum through 2025 and beyond. We have made purposeful and strategic investments, which we're seeing contribute to consistent, higher growth, and strong financial performance. We have been and remain very intentional with how we are deploying our capital towards higher growth spaces and are pleased with the significant progress we continue to make increasing our WAMGR. These actions have evolved BD into an agile, innovative, and durable medical technology company with a compelling growth profile. Our innovation mindset is driving higher product development velocity and super cycles of innovation in many of our businesses. Through a focus on the most impactful programs, improved milestone achievement and launch excellence. To highlight a few examples of our strategy and investments, and how they're fueling strong results and momentum. First in Pharm Systems, due to the start of our BD 2025 journey, we made a bold decision to invest $1.2 billion in additional capacity. Today, we're seeing this capacity investment along with several new innovations we've brought to market, paying off as we are ideally positioned to enable delivery of the large wave of biotech drugs coming to market. We've built Pharm Systems into a $2 billion growth platform with 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. With over 70% of the top 100 biopharma companies using BD's portfolio and 6x the capacity of the nearest competitor we are well-positioned to continue delivering strong growth. Second, during COVID, we also made several strategic reinvestments of certain COVID-only testing proceeds, particularly in our BDB business, which is one of the areas with a super cycle of new breakthrough innovations coming to market over this and the next several years. We've already begun to see acceleration from some of the early new launches notably in biopharma for cell therapy and immune oncology research. Looking forward to the upcoming launch of our FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter. That was previously featured on the cover of the journal Science. The S8 combines advanced spectral flow cytometry with novel CellView Image Technology. By combining the power of high parameter spectral flow cytometry with an unprecedented picture of a cell and its inner workings. We are defining a new standard in flow cytometry, which will empower scientists to unlock life changing discoveries across fields like immunology, cancer research, and cell biology. We recently shipped our first early access BD FACSDiscover S8 and we remain on track for launch later this quarter. We've also already begun launching a new family of [spectrally] [ph] optimized BD Horizon reagents that together with the FACSDiscover S8 will create a unique spectral solution inclusive of instruments, dyes, and informatics that only BD can offer. Third, as you know, we have been very purposeful in increasing tuck-in M&A to drive scale within high growth adjacent markets. And have built strong M&A capabilities to successfully integrate assets. Our most recent acquisition of Parata's Pharmacy Automation Solutions continues to exceed our expectations and we're already seeing an early impact from revenue synergies. The Parata acquisition expanded our offering to establish BD as a leader in pharmacy automation and created a new growth platform with revenues in excess of $0.5 billion growing double-digits. This is an attractive growing market that uses automation to address a number of the critical issues faced by our customers, such as wage inflation, labor attrition, pharmacist burn-out, and the need to reallocate pharmacist's valuable time to clinical care.  Parata is just one example of the successful tuck-in acquisitions we've made over the last several years. These acquisitions are currently contributing about 30 basis points to our organic growth rate this year. And once Parata annualizes, we expect that contribution will increase to about 50 basis points. Lastly, we continue to build on our strong competency of serially innovating on and expanding the application of new technologies we develop or acquire. This is exemplified in our urology and critical care business, where our acquisition of PureWick continues to provide significant benefits to patients, and is also an impactful growth driver for UCC. We've already launched the home version of PureWick Female, which continues to be very well received and is aligned with our focus on providing solutions and new care settings. And at the end of FY 2022, we launched PureWick Male, the newest product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. PureWick Male provides nurses with a non-invasive option for urine management in men, enabling earlier catheter removal and reduced risk of infection. We are receiving exceptional customer feedback and the adoption of PureWick Male is exceeding our expectations. We have multiple additional R&D programs in the pipeline, to continue to expand our solutions in and incontinence. These are just some of the examples of key investment decisions we have executed to strengthen our business, contributing to our performance today and over the long-term. Turning to our quarterly financial results. We are seeing the strength of our BD 2025 strategy in action across all businesses and geographies in our Q2 performance. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results that exceeded our expectations with 8.7% base revenue growth and double-digit currency neutral earnings growth. But we are excited by what we have achieved to date. We have much more to look forward to. Let me provide a few examples of how we progressed our pipeline this quarter. Starting with our recent launches, in our BD Medical segment, we launched our PowerMe midline catheter in China. And by the beginning of March, it was being used in the first patient. PowerMe was designed by our R&D center in China for China and we're excited about the opportunity it creates to develop a new category of vascular access in China. In our Life Sciences segment, we're really excited about how the BD core platform is expanding us into the high throughput, high growth molecular diagnostics market. In Q2, we received 510(k) clearance for our new Vaginal Panel on BD COR. The world's first microbiome based PCR assay that uses a single swab and test to simultaneously detect the three most common causes of vaginitis infections, enabling targeted cost effective treatment. And in our BDI segment, we launched our Highlander 014 PTA Balloon in Q2. Highlander is the first and only non-compliant fiber based balloon designed to treat peripheral artery disease and below the knee anatomy. We are proud to be leading in this space, building on our history of continuous innovation in the higher growth PVD market. We've also hit several crucial milestones this quarter. These include regulatory submissions of the PIVO Pro and BD Nexiva with NearPort IV Access, which are core elements of our One Stick Hospital Stay and Vascular Access Management strategy in our MDS business. In our biosciences business, we completed the early access program for our BD Rhapsody HT Xpress. And in fact, I'm pleased to report that just in the last few days we announced the launch. The HT Xpress is a single cell analysis system that increases the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform eightfold, while maintaining compatibility with our existing single cell assays and reagents. This new instrument enabled access to the fast growing translational single-cell multiomics market with a high throughput research solution. And in our surgery business, we completed testing for our Phasix ST Umbilical product to support a 510(k) submission later this fiscal year. Phasix ST Umbilical is designed to provide patients reliable, alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of the category leading bio resorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. Phasix ST Umbilical will be the first fully reservable product customized for open umbilical repairs, which represents the majority of umbilical procedures. This is another example of a technology reacquired and are now expanding and accelerating the growth of. These launches and milestones are good examples of how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. While we advance our growth strategy, we also remain focused on our number 1 priority to bring the Alaris pump back to market. We are confident in the resources invested in our submission, the team and leadership task to prioritize this, and that we will get clearance. As we have stated in the past the relaunch of Alaris is included in the BD 2025 strategic plan. And while we cannot predict clearance timelines, we can ensure that we are prepared for the relaunch with the proper operational capacity and functional capabilities so that we can provide our customers with the best experience. As a reminder, we've launched an updated Alaris pump in several international markets and continue to receive very positive feedback from customers. In Q2, we continue to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio, and our operating model. We made further progress on our recode portfolio simplification program, which reduces SKUs in order to improve customer service and focus on the most important products needed to deliver care. We remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, improve cost and service, while delivering on our ESG goals to address climate change and carbon neutrality. Earlier this year, we expanded our recode initiatives to include our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness and simplify our organization to improve Agility. These actions resulted in us reducing our overall headcount by about 2% this year. We also recently made the strategic decision to partner with a leading business process and professional services firm and are transitioning certain BD shared service center business processes. They will be working to optimize our back office processes and services using automation, data, and process excellence that they have implemented very successfully with other large companies. Collectively, our simplification programs are a core part of our strategy to drive efficiency and enable impactful growth. To share some perspective on the macro environment, overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in-line with our view that challenges will persist not escalate. While we're seeing signs of inflation cooling off, it is still more than twice the historical average. We see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles, particularly in our supply chain organization. Across raw materials, some categories such as resins used and finished goods are beginning to show signs of stabilization. But overall, they have not come down universally and remain well above prior cost levels. In terms of supply availability, we have seen significant improvements across materials, supplies and labor, which are driving our back order reduction leading us to recover towards pre-pandemic supply levels. Broadly speaking, we are seeing stabilization and continued overall procedure volume recovery and volume momentum. Specific to China, we delivered strong performance despite some impact from increased COVID cases in the region and reduced hospital capacity that carried into Q2. We experienced a strong recovery in March and remain well-positioned for continued growth in China. Our strategy has proven to enable strong results in some of the most challenging times. And by successfully navigating the macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and remain well positioned to deliver continued strong performance. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'll provide an update on the progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We continue to be proud of our leading focus on reducing the environmental impact of our product portfolio and we recently announced the launch of our new circular economy pilots in several regions, but we are partnering with healthcare facilities and waste management companies to recycle used materials, including BD syringes in the U.S. and BD vacutainers in Denmark. In addition to launching our 2022 cybersecurity annual report in early Q2, we also established the BD Cybersecurity Risk Committee, which serves as the management level governance body for oversight of all Cybersecurity risk across the company. The committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and its members include cybersecurity leaders across enterprise, manufacturing, and product cybersecurity, as well as key functional leaders. We are also proud to receive continued recognition for our ongoing commitment to talent and culture. Most recently, we renamed the noteworthy company for the fourth straight year in Diversity Inc.'s annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity. We look forward to providing further updates on the commitments, disclosures, and progress on the four pillars of our ESG strategy. Company health, planet health, community health, and human health as we publish our 15th annual ESG report later this year. In summary, I'm proud of our progress and the positive impact our associates are delivering for our customers and patients around the world. Our purposeful and strategic investments in attractive end markets are driving higher growth and creating value. Our innovation mindset is improving our pipeline execution and launch excellence and creating the most exciting product pipeline in the company's history. Our simplification efforts are reducing complexity and driving business process excellence and agility. Our increased guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects our strategy and action, strong execution by our team and a strengthened growth profile. We will continue to increase investments to support profitable growth through 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance, and outlook. Hey, Robbie, good morning. This is Tom. Obviously, as we've discussed many times, getting Alaris back on the market is our number 1 priority. And we are confident in the resources that we have invested in our submission and the team and leadership tasked to prioritize this. As you expected and as we've said before, we're confident in our process and that we will get clearance, and we have been and want to remain prudent and thoughtful about the process with the FDA. And so therefore, we continue to not try to predict exact time lines just given how inherently complex these submissions are. So, obviously, once we get clearance, we'll immediately communicate at that point, and that has been and remains our strategy there. But we're fully focused on making sure that our number 1 job is making sure that the FDA has all the information they require to clear the product. Thanks for the question. Okay. Good morning, Larry and thanks for the great question. Great to connect as always. We're extremely excited about the pipeline that we have and our outlook going forward. We're not looking to adjust our long-term commitment at this time, but we are feeling very positive about the momentum that we have as you described. I think as we look at where we are today, what stands out, and hopefully it became clear in our discussions this morning, are the number of high-growth platforms that we've built and that we've continued to systematically progress across the company. And we talked about a few of those. Whether or not it's Pharm Systems, which is now the 11th quarter in a row of double-digit growth, and the macro environment of now biologics being \u2013 more biologics being in pharma's pipeline and small molecules today, first time in history, and some big blockbuster products coming down the pipe. And we are well-positioned as the leader in injectable drug delivery to benefit from that trend with the significant capacity we've added, as well as the innovation pipeline we have, both for professional delivery, but also enabling wearables and self-injection products that we've been investing in are coming to market now as well. Pharmacy automation, right now, a $500 million-plus platform growing in the teens. Huge trends that are going to continue to fuel that going forward, labor shortages, the need for pharmacists to move more front of the \u2013 front-off to be serving patients doing wellness checks, et cetera, we're going to continue to see strong demand for pharmacy automation, and we're really pleased with that platform that we've built. B2B, huge super cycle of innovation there. The FACSDiscover, we've started shipping to the early adopter sites and really a tremendous opportunity to help bring new insights and new discoveries in the areas of cell therapy and immuno-oncology and just understanding the immune system overall. When you think about who is getting Nobel Prizes in those fields that I just described, almost all of them were using flow cytometry. And I'm convinced you're going to see a whole new set of discoveries being uncovered with the new technologies that we're rolling out there right now. Really excited. And of course, that's complemented not only on the capital side with FACSDiscover. And the product we're launching now is just the first in a whole family that we're going to be continuing to roll-out. We're rolling out the high-end sorter first, but we're going to be offering mid-and-lower-end sorters or cell analyzers, utilizing that same technology over the next several years. That's complemented by our new die portfolio and expanding antibody portfolio, as well as informatics technologies that we have launched and will continue to launch. BD Interventional, you heard us talk about a number of great growth platforms that have been developed there, and we're seeing good strong growth out of the BDI segment. This was another strong quarter there. And you're seeing a number of the acquisitions that we've done over the last few years or had done just before BD and Bard came together, things like PureWick and the [indiscernible] innovation that's happening there, TIFA, which we acquired over the last few years and how we're expanding that into new applications, we gave an example of umbilical hernia. Straub Medical and how that's being expanded globally. And you're seeing the benefits of that in the PI business. We're really pleased with the growth momentum that's happening there. And of course, medication delivery, a continuing strong growth in our portfolio there from catheters to picks and eventually through our planning horizon and our aim to get Alaris back on market. So, we're really pleased with the momentum. We're really pleased with the launches we've done to date. We've had about 10 key launches so far this fiscal year that's coming off of 25 key launches last year. And we continue to be on track for about that same number again this year and pretty much every year as we look forward. Thanks for the question. And just to add to Chris, as good comments is \u2013 so Alaris is included in our strategic plan. There's many other levers we have as mentioned. But we have been, as we've shared before, preparing so that when we do get Alaris clearance eventually, that we'll be well-positioned to serve our customers, right? And so, we've talked about that increased inventory levels that we've done on certain components, et cetera. We've talked about the continued investments we have, kept in service in our selling organization so that when clearance eventually comes, that we can both remediate the pumps that are on the market quickly, as well as support additional customers. So, thank you for the question. Yes. Great question, Vijay, and appreciate the comments. So, we'll go around. We've got the segment presence here in the room. I think you're right. What you're seeing is outperforming market growth rates in a number of categories, and we're really pleased with that, driven really through strong innovation, capacity investments that we've made and strong execution. Why don't we start with the Medical segment and Mike can speak to what we're seeing in both Pharm Systems, but also pharmacy automation and medication management overall. And maybe just to add to Rick's good comments there. I think something that stands out for particularly the PI business is a number of the investments and new launches that are happening there are in entirely new markets for BD. And so, they're almost exclusively share gains that are happening that are driving growth, right?  So, you think about atherectomy and thrombectomy, that's 100% share gain. I think about the Venclose acquisition that we did and the growth that's coming from that, that's all share gain because we hadn't been in the category. And of course, Venovo stent, we have been off the market. And so, the relaunch of that is regaining \u2013 is all regaining market share. And just to more specifically address that question very as well, and maybe, Dave? I think just to add to Chris' comment, obviously, the update here has COVID essentially out for the balance of the year, right? So, the number that we have now in COVID guidance is basically the COVID number that we have year-to-date. And I think we're seeing the benefits. Obviously, given the strength of the business, taking those actions on that portfolio is exactly the \u2013 it's the right time to be doing that. As a reminder, those products that we're just exiting have less than half of the average GP of the company. They're growing much less than the average of the company and are in areas that are just not strategic in terms of relevant growth platforms as we go forward. And so, they also come with operational efficiency benefits, organizational efficiency benefits, et cetera. And so, they're just going to make us that much stronger as we go forward and make sure that we're focusing our resources and investments in those areas that move the needle the most for customers and for us. Okay. Great question. Why don't we start on the first two with Chris and then Dave can take for the Veritor, MAX. Yes. And obviously, we continue to focus on delivering on our 5.5% plus, but as Chris said, we do not have plans to do that again. These are very discrete products. We've given some examples before things like [indiscernible] or washing instruments for orthopedic procedures that, again, we just don't have a relevant role in those spaces and so we've exited those revenues. And we would not see that repeating in the future. Just one thing as you see price after the close of the market today, just to reinforce a comment that Chris made in the opening comments is that we did see very strong volume this quarter as we think about price and volume and the role of those two together. As we look at volume, we look at it organic volume, and then we take out flu-COVID sales as well, right? Because that's something that's not really indicative of, kind of our ongoing business. And when you look at that organic volume growth, excluding COVID-flu, it's strong mid-single digits, nearly 6% overall volume in the quarter. And so, that's something you'll also see as those further reports come out, something very positive that we're continuing to see across the business. When it comes to Veritor and MAXs, I know Dave had made some earlier comments about the very strong double-digit growth that we continue to see in MAX reagent absorption. But why don't you share some more color on that? Thanks for the question, Rick, and it's a good question. We're focused obviously on continuing to execute our strategy, and we are very pleased with our progress, both on our portfolio and the reshaping that we've been doing. Of course, that includes an \u2013 and Embecta spin just not that long ago as well, which we're pleased with how that's turned out and is allowing each organization to focus. As we look ahead, I'll just go back to the growth platforms that we've been systematically building and are continuing to gain momentum in, right? We talked about areas like Pharm Systems, like pharmacy automation, like BDB flow cytometry, innovation super cycle, like our Interventional Solutions, our Medication Delivery Solutions and our continued innovation focus, our continued outperforming of WAMGR and how we've been supplementing that with strong tuck-in M&A that, as Chris mentioned, as Parata anniversaries this summer, we'll be contributing 50 basis points of underlying growth. We continue to have a very strong funnel, we continue to be exclusively on tuck-in. M&A has been part of our strategy. And obviously, we've been very focused. Mike and team have been heads down executing the integration of Parata exceptionally well. To see revenue synergies this early in the game is quite unique. And just as a reminder, that was accretive to our operating margins right from the start, and they're getting expense synergies going now as well, too, right, which only improves that dynamic. So, we're really happy with how we've been executing tuck-in M&A, the capabilities that we've \u2013 and track record that we've developed there, which gives us the right to continue to make that an important part of our strategy as we go forward. And I think we've talked about in the past, this is really a new lever for BD, right? We're a 125-year-old company. And tuck-in M&A had not been a systematic part of our strategy historically. Obviously, back in 2015, you saw the beginning of two large transformational M&A deals. We obviously did not do tuck-in M&A during that period of time as all the cash was going to pay down debt. And so, this era where we've done quite a number over the last three years, how you're seeing those build systematically stronger business profiles and growth platforms and how we're going to continue with our focus on cash and profitability to drive that going forward is a new part of our equation that's complemented by our strong organic innovation. One thing we didn't mention on this call is \u2013 although we've been talking about historically is that when it comes to innovation, we've made really strong progress in improving our on-time launches and our on-time milestone delivery, getting into the top quartile. And we had exited FY 2022 with our best ever performance. We're beating FY 2022 again in the first half of this year, right? So, we're hitting new records and on-time milestone delivery and on-time launches. And so, we're getting that productivity out of our organic investments as well, which is really positive as we look ahead. When it comes to margin, and Chris can jump in further to this, yes, we feel confident in our 25% margin by 2025, and we've talked about that. It could be opportunity to exceed that, and we would make decisions on do we let that flow through or do we further invest that? I think our first priority will continue to be making sure that we invest in strong growth. We have a lot of exciting opportunities and markets that we participate in. We've described a number of them the day on the call and have been discussing them for some time. We're going to continue to invest behind that, creating a durable growth organization that's supporting, transforming the future of health care in the areas that we've consistently talked about around smart connected care, around enabling the shift, the new care settings and around improving outcomes for patients with chronic disease. And so that's our focus. Let's get to 25% margin first, and then we can look at optionalities from there. Chris, any other?"

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments our BD 2025 strategy is driving consistent performance and demonstrates our strong growth profile. With our year to date performance, we are well on track to achieve our FY 2025 long-term targets. Beginning with some color on our revenue performance, we delivered strong Q2 base revenue growth of 8.7% or 7% organic. This includes growing over prior year flu COVID combination sales, which negatively impact growth by over 200 basis points and an impact from one-time strategic portfolio exits of about 50 basis points. Adjusting for these impacts, organic volume growth was in the strong mid-single digits at nearly 6%. In addition to the inorganic revenue contribution from M&A, we continue to drive organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter. COVID-only testing revenues were $16 million in the quarter, which as expected declined from 214 million last year. Total company base business growth was strong across BD Medical, and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 9.3% respectively. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 2.2% includes a negative impact of about 800 basis points, due to the comparison to higher combination flu COVID testing sales last year attributable to the Omicron wave, coupled with the timing of this year's respiratory season that peaked earlier than normal during fiscal Q1 and then declined. Base revenue growth was strong across all regions with high-single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally, including 9% growth in China. For the full-year, we expect to deliver high-single-digit growth in China. Our growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core portfolio and our shift into attractive and higher growth end markets. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes our durable core where we continue to drive growth in vascular access management with our BD Posiflush and Catheter Solutions. In Medication Management Solutions, our investments in high growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. In our Dispensing platform, continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the recent launch of BD Pyxis ES 1.7 and the BD HealthSight portfolio drove double-digit growth. And in Pharm Systems in the higher growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market our capacity investments and newer innovations in products such as BD Effivax, BD Hylok, and BD Neopak are driving continued double-digit growth. Strong underlying performance in our Life Sciences segment reflects growth in our durable core in specimen management and execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including single cell analysis, microbiology, and molecular diagnostics. In our IDS business, growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution, including adoption of the recently launched IdentifA and Total Modular Track solutions. Double-digit growth in Molecular IVD assays reflects continued leverage of our large install base. In Biosciences, high teens growth was driven by new innovations, in BD Horizon dyes, and our expanded antibody portfolio that drove double-digit growth in research reagents and continued strong demand for our BD FACSymphony, flow cytometry analyzers. Strong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including advanced repair and reconstruction, PBD, oncology, and incontinence. Our newer innovations in higher growth areas are all contributing nicely to growth. Our surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth with continued market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold, driving double-digit growth in advanced repair and reconstruction, and double-digit growth in biosurgery that was aided by Arista. In our PI business unit, the relaunch of Venovo and global penetration of Rotarex are driving high single-digit growth. In our UCC business unit, high-single-digit growth continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth of the PureWick franchise that was aided by the recent launch of PureWick Male. Across BDI, procedure volumes were also strong in the quarter contributing to growth, particularly in our surgery business unit. Further details regarding each segment's performance in the quarter can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.  Now, moving to our P&L. We reported Q2 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86, which included gross margin of 54.2%, it was slightly ahead of our expectations and operating margin of 22.7% that was in-line with expectations. Our margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth, the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives, and strategic portfolio exits that enabled our ability to more than overcome nearly 200 basis points of outsized inflation, which was in-line with our expectations. Gross margin also reflects negative FX, which was slightly higher than anticipated. SSG&A expense increased 5% year-over-year. Half of the SSG&A increase was driven by the unfavorable impact of an employee benefit related item that gets recorded in G&A and is offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 50 basis points of leverage in SSG&A with shipping growth in-line with revenues and good leverage in selling expense. As expected, our phasing of R&D continues to be weighted to the first half of the year with R&D as a percent of sales of 6.5% in Q2. Our R&D investments are aligned to our long-term growth strategy and have been a catalyst to increased velocity of product development. In summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q2 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 80 basis points, including absorbing a 30 basis point headwind from lower COVID-only testing. Our tax rate in Q2 was lower than anticipated, due to the timing of certain discrete items that were contemplated to occur during the year. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $584 million year-to-date. Operating cash flow reflects an elevated inventory balance that has enabled our strong performance and ability to meet peak demands and support our customers' needs while navigating the complexity of the macro environment. We remain focused on reducing our inventory balance and have several initiatives underway to do so. As a result, while we saw peak inventory levels during the quarter, we exited the quarter with positive progress towards reducing inventory. We expect inventory to continue to decline over the balance of the year with the most prominent reduction expected in Q4 to levels similar to the prior year. We're also driving more effective capital expenditures for the full-year and expect expenditures to be similar to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2 billion, which includes the proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the year. We ended Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 3.1x. We expect to pay down our commercial paper over the balance of the year and move towards our net leverage target of 2.5x. As the year progresses and we build cash, we will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our quarter performance, we are confident in raising the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The strength of our base revenue growth and consistent execution of our margin goals is enabling our ability to offset lower COVID-only testing revenues and the latest FX rates, while reinvesting in the business to drive future growth. Starting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well-positioned for strong growth across our three segments, which are delivering at or above our expectations, and thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 6.5% to 7%. This is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 5.75% to 6.75%, and is driven by our Q2 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our team's continued strong execution and our consistent growth profile. Following our strong FY 2022 growth of 9.4%, we again increased our revenue guidance in FY 2023, which at the midpoint brings our two-year average growth to about 8% or 7% organic, which is well above our 5.5% plus target. Increased base revenue guidance includes both higher organic and inorganic growth expectations for the full-year. We now expect inorganic revenue to contribute approximately 125 basis points of base revenue growth for the full-year, which is an increase of 25 basis points, driven by the strong execution of Parata. Organic based revenue growth is now expected to be 5.25% to 5.75%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. Both our base revenue and base organic revenue growth continue to include a reduction of approximately 100 basis points, resulting from our planned one-time strategic portfolio exits. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in-line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comparisons and Interventional to be above the total company range. For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $50 million to $100 million, driven by the reduced testing volumes as a result of the early peak and rapid decline of the respiratory season. All-in, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $50 million at the midpoint to a range of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion, compared to $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion previously. Regarding Alaris, we continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in-line with fiscal 2022 demand. Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full-year. We are executing as planned and the actions required for the year to drive margin improvement remain unchanged. Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with the significant simplify actions in place, including the previously planned operating model programs that we recently announced, gives us the confidence that we will again deliver meaningful margin expansion this year, while absorbing about 200 basis points of outsized inflation and the incremental decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile. Below operating income, our assumptions regarding interest other remains unchanged, and we have narrowed our effective tax rate guidance to 13.25% to 14%. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.10 and $12.32, which represents an increase of $0.015 at the midpoint. This reflects a base business increase of $0.115 that is driving our ability to offset incremental headwinds of approximately $0.05 each from COVID-only testing and foreign currency. Our adjusted EPS guidance reflects currency-neutral growth that is around double digits and within a range of approximately 9.5% to 11%. This includes very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14% to 15.5%, which is over 100 basis points higher than we previously anticipated and is driving our ability to absorb the decline in COVID-only testing. Our updated guidance reflects significant progress towards delivering the BD 2025 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day, including: a strong two-year organic base revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our 5.5% plus long-term target; at least 380 basis points or about 70% of our targeted 540 basis points of base operating margin expansion toward our targeted 25% margin levels in FY 2025; and a strong high-teens two-year base business EPS CAGR, which is also well above our double-digit long-term target. As we think of fiscal 2023 phasing, let me provide some comments for you to consider as you model out the balance of the year. We've outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note. First, regarding base revenues, the midpoint of our updated guidance continues to reflect strong organic growth of about 6% in the second half of the year. We expect organic growth to be fairly ratable over the quarters with some different prior year comparisons in each quarter. As a reminder, we will anniversary the inorganic contribution from the Parata and MedKeeper acquisitions in Q3, which means that Q4 base revenue will be all organic. Second, as you think about margins, as we have described throughout the year, most of the full-year improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin, which is muted because of outsized inflation in fiscal year 2023. We've seen that play out over the first two quarters where gross margin was slightly below the prior year margin in Q1 and slightly above in Q2. We expect a similar dynamic in Q3 where you should be slightly ahead of the prior year's 52.6%. For operating margin, our expectation is for Q3 year-over-year margin improvement, similar to our full-year operating margin expansion expectation and slight improvement sequentially from the 22.7% in Q2. R&D as a percent of revenue will moderate down towards our expected full-year average of about 6% in Q3, while Q4 will be the low at about 5% of sales. Lastly, the midpoint of our full-year effective tax rate guidance indicates an estimated tax rate of about 16.5% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly in Q3 and Q4 as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict. In closing, as we approach the halfway point, our BD 2025 strategy has consistently delivered multiple periods of strong financial performance. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance and our progress towards our BD 2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please? Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It's Chris. Appreciate the question. I think this is pretty straightforward. So first, just look, another strong quarter and our second increase in guidance, to your point. On revenue, we increased from 6.5% to 7% or 50 basis points on our base. So, at the midpoint, that's 6.75%. And I think important to note, right, our two-year average growth now, 8% or even 7% when you strip out the benefit from tuck-in M&A, so on a pure organic basis. So, really strong, well above our 5.5% profile. As you think of the increase, basically the increase in revenue 100% matched the outperformance in Q2. The way to think of that, if you recall last quarter, we communicated that our second half growth rate would be 6.6. That stayed intact. So, we're holding it to 6.6. Importantly, as you think of the first half to the second half, actually, the organic revenue growth accelerates from 5 to 6, and again, nicely above our 5.5% plus. So, really strong revenue story following a strong FY 2022. On earnings, where I think the core of your question is, so, one, building on the strong growth. We continue to execute against our margin goals. Hopefully, that hasn't gotten lost in this macro environment where you're seeing many in multiple industries with margins declining. So, we're committed to the 100 basis points of margin improvement. We had slight improvement in the quarter. So that holds intact. So basically, the way to think of the raise, you have to, kind of break it down and really understand the base business. So, on the base business, as we noted in the presentation, we raised by [$0.115] [ph]. It exactly equals, kind of margin drop-through on the 90 million increase on our base revenue. And then you noticed we slightly modified our \u2013 the midpoint of our tax guide. So, the revenue accounts for about 60% of it, the tax accounts for the best. I think also important to note, we're not getting any year-over-year benefit on tax. It's actually still a year-over-year headwind that's absorbed in our full-year guidance. So, I think it reflects really strong base performance. And I think another important reminder \u2013 so anyway, that $0.115, it basically absorbs two factors. You noticed that we moderated down the COVID-only testing by about $25 million. That has a strong drop-through in the margin because there's very little commercial investment. It has a higher GP, as we've shared in the past. So, we more than absorbed that. And then we did absorb some FX pressure on EPS, which was pretty modest. That was $0.05 in lieu of actually dropping for FX like we normally do and adjusting our guide range. It was $0.05. We absorbed that on the strong base performance. FX, there was a little bit \u2013 if you remember in the quarter, the dollar strengthened significantly and the euro recovered. So, you actually have to look at the average in the quarter. So, there was a little bit in the quarter with the euro. You also had the yuan and the yen were the other two currencies. So, just modest impacts there. Net-net, it's a raise by [$0.015] [ph] at the midpoint. And then I think the most important thing for everyone to keep in mind, when you just look at our base EPS growth year-over-year, knowing that we're absorbing significant year-over-year declines in COVID-only testing, our actual EPS growth on the base business is nearly 15%, well above our double-digit EPS. So, we feel really good about where we sit, the halfway through the year. We haven't changed any of our, kind of core commitments around margin. With that said, we want to make sure we solidify the future. We want to keep investing. We continue to invest in R&D at higher levels. And this isn't about one quarter, one year. We think this is \u2013 what you're seeing here is a great growth story play out that will happen over multiple periods and will be durable. Yes. Thanks, Larry. I'll take that one. Yes, to your point, if you recall, given that we made the decision to maintain investment in service, field support, et cetera, there was about that 80 basis point headwind to our margin as part of Alaris. We've been very clear, while we haven't been \u2013 said we weren't going to predict timing, we did say as part of our FY 2025 plan. The good thing about margin, and just if you step back again, we delivered 50% of our goal, right, through FY 2022. We're on-track this year. That would put us 70% towards our goal. We have multiple levers to deliver both. In essence, the way we think of it is how do we get to double-digit EPS growth on a consistent basis. We're not dependent on one variable. And given 70% of the way there, we feel really good between the strong growth profile that we expect to continue and natural leverage you get. The Recode initiatives we put in place, that will continue to accelerate through the back half of the year. We just announced kind of the third leg of Project Recode, operating model simplification. Those have been announced, continuing to drive portfolio mix as we've been doing. So, there's a host of things that I think give us confidence and the ability to actually, sort of navigate the balance between top line growth and margin improvement as we continue to progress through the back half of the year while delivering on both commitments, the 25% margin and double-digit EPS growth. So, I think we're really well-positioned when you think of it that way, gives us a lot of flexibility. Yes. So, a couple of things. One, if you remember, from a full-year standpoint, we're absorbing over 200 basis points. It's a second consecutive year of inflationary pressures. It was actually more prominent in the first half of the year. It will abate some combination of some moderation of inflation, coupled with, of course, the cost improvement actions and mitigation actions that we're taking in the second half. So, we expected modest improvement in GP through from a full-year standpoint. So, I think you would expect basically similar, to be slightly ahead of our Q3 FY 2022 gross margin, which was 52.6%. So, you'll see slight improvement. And then that will further expand as we move into Q4. But we're right on track. And I think the other thing to point out is, remember, we have about five months of inventory that flows through our sales. So, we have a strong line of sight to basically the inflation that is sitting in that inventory, all the cost improvement that has actually been driven that's part of that inventory cost. And as that sells through in the back half of the year, it gives us strong confidence in our cost base to achieve those goals. Yes, that's correct. Just one comment on FX, which is interesting, right. Our fiscal period starts earlier. We actually \u2013 our original guide started at the peak of the strength of the U.S. dollar, right? So, we had significant FX pressure when we gave our initial guide. And to your point, in Q1 the dollar weakened a bit. We adjusted up similar to most companies reporting sort of their first fiscal year. And so, we reversed a lot of that unfavorability in the quarter, gave that back. The base was strong, the base EPS actually expanded, and to your point, offset \u2013 we had a takedown in our COVID-only testing in Q1. This quarter is a little bit different. Again, you had strong base EPS. We actually raised by $0.115. It was offset by two things. Again, another $0.05 on the COVID-only testing dynamics, taking that down a bit to how we see the full year given that those dynamics and market has softened significantly, and then a little bit of FX pressure for the reasons I noted previously. So, net of those two items, it's [$0.015] [ph], but I will go back to just what I shared. So again, when you look at our base business, absorbing all the COVID-only year-over-year testing impacts, our base EPS is growing almost 15%, and that's while absorbing over 200 basis points of inflationary pressures. I think it's somewhat unprecedented performance in this environment. We're delivering really strong growth. And we want to make sure that we're maintaining investments to also continue this type of performance well into the future. So, that's how to think of it. Hopefully, that helps. The other, just given those FX dynamics, right, when FX improved, we only had three quarters to go, right? So when we cycle into our fiscal Q1, which is calendar Q4, there will actually be FX tailwind based on where spot rates are today. There's a lot of moving parts to calculate that directly. But on top line, it could be $75 million to $100 million. So, when you look at other people's guide that has a full true calendar year, that's included. We picked that up next year in ours. Yes, yes, exactly. The simple way to think of it is, so our all-in guide that includes the negative impact of portfolio exits and the positive impact of organic is [675] [ph] at the midpoint, right? But even if you strip out just the M&A contribution, we're still at 5.5 at the midpoint. Now, that's not taking any credit for the strategic portfolio exits. That was purely just to make sure you guys had context to \u2013 we were taking that bold action, it's helping improve margin given the strong growth profile we have. So, when you think of pure underlying against all the businesses we're investing in, if you want to adjust for that, that's about a point that would take it back up to that same range. But even if you get zero credit for that, our organic growth is 5.5%. And more importantly, our two-year, right, coming off a really strong year, we're 7% organic. None of those numbers give us a positive adjustment for those one-time strategic portfolio exits. Yes. And the other \u2013 just one last comment. You mentioned Parata and the strength there. This is a little unique, right? You get the sort of onetime adjustment for what you acquired. This is a great example of us just strong execution in revenue synergies and taking up that forecast. So, again, I think it's just illustrative of how we're managing, kind of tuck-in and the benefits we're generating from that. As we anniversary Parata, the contribution from all the tuck-in acquisitions we will do on an organic basis, it will add about 50 basis points of growth to our portfolio as we exit this year. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Yes. So, pricing, Joanne, so the Q will come out this evening and we \u2013 aftermarket. And pricing will be disclosed in there as we consistently have. What we've shared is it's the last thing we think about, right, as it relates to inflation mitigation. And so, what we're really focused on is driving cost improvement, portfolio mix, the strength of growth and volume leverage. All of those dynamics are significant contributors to mitigating the 200 basis point inflation. You'll probably see something consistent in terms of what we've done last year. If you think of how last year played out, it accelerated through the year. But you'll be able to see that at the end of the day. In terms of portfolio, I mean, the simple answer to the question is, these were onetime in nature. There's always smaller adjustments you make in your portfolio, but we made a decision to really take a deep look at our portfolio this year, as Tom described. These weren't strategic products. There's market alternatives. The GP profile is significantly reduced. Removing these freeze up capacity and other costs. All of those products, not being sure they still require quality support, regulatory support, there's a lot of tie up as it relates to shipping and thinking of other infrastructure support. So, there's benefit beyond just the GP lift you get. But to answer your question simply, yes, if we stopped doing that, our results would have been better by roughly 100 basis points this year. This quarter was a little light. It was closer to 50 basis points in the quarter. But from a full-year, we're still estimating about 100 basis points. We do view these as one-time in nature this year. We don't anticipate doing that in the future beyond smaller things that we would just absorb and not even talk about. Thank you for the question, Joanne. Good morning, Rick. Yes. Just maybe a few small adds. I mean, one, look, I do think the value proposition that BD offers is unique. And we're not changing in our commitments. We talked about 5.5 plus, but to your point, what's been clear, right, our two-year growth, 7% organic. We're clearly in the plus side of the equation. I think for all the reasons Tom noted, we have a portfolio that has the ability that we want to continue to try and drive the plus. But our commitment is 5.5%. I think the nice thing about that is that is maybe underappreciated. There's very few companies in med tech that can deliver that outsized growth, but still have this nice durable profile. It's very de-risked. So, you get this benefit of strong mid-single digits, it's extremely reliable, while we're posting outsized growth and improving margin in a very complex environment and haven't even fully capitalized maybe on some of the levers Tom talked about, like the firepower we'll have with tuck-in M&A going forward, or margin, really, I'll go back to \u2013 we're committed to double-digit earnings growth, which isn't easy to do. Obviously, we can moderate that depending on the growth profile, what we want to make sure we do is, consistently invest in the right areas to drive that growth, right? We continue to increase R&D, et cetera. So, all those factors would be sort of contemplated, but certainly confident in double-digit EPS growth, being able to consistently do that. So, I think it's a nice balance of you're seeing an inflection in growth and really strong growth that's differentiated. You're seeing differentiation and execution and you have a de-risked portfolio. It's hard to find all those pieces. It should make people feel good. Thanks for the question, Rick."

            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "Yes, for sure. Vijay, it's Dave. Great question. So, again, I mean, just to reiterate for the segment. So, I mean, as you saw in the in the release, just a tremendous strong quarter for BDB at 18.7% and even good core growth in IDS, if you strip away the headwind from the 800 bps of respiratory climb over from same period last year. I'll maybe pick a couple of highlights. I mean, in BDB, we continue to see really strong growth across the board, whether it's the Life Science research reagents, clinical reagents, the demand for the new instruments. Actually, from a Life Science research reagent perspective, so this is the dyes, the Horizon dyes that Tom talked about, that's actually our tenth successive quarter of double-digit growth now. You've heard us talk about BD Max before, which was obviously instrumental in the COVID, sort of pandemic from a respiratory perspective. But how do we now leverage the BD Max for take-up of IVDs and assay utilization and assay penetration? And again, we continue to see really good growth in molecular reagents, eight successive quarters of IVD double-digit growth, which is great. And then maybe on the automation side, we \u2013 when you think about the staffing challenges that the labs are facing, we're really starting to see the traction for BD Kiestra, BD COR that Thomas talked about.  If you think \u2013 you asked a specific question on the sustainability and the customers relative to BDB. The good thing about BDB and just the breadth of platform and reagents that we have is, we've got a very strong diversity of customer base, so not just by a pharma, for sure biopharma, but academia, large academic medical centers, big research institutions. So, I think the diversity of base really helps us there and the types of research that they're doing, right? So, you think about cell therapy, gene therapy, immuno-oncology, all the stuff in terms of fighting that chronic disease in oncology. So, I think we feel really good about that base. And then from that sustainability, I was just reflecting back as we were getting ready for today, and when you look at the segment overall, even for the first half of this year, we've actually had two PMA supplements approved and eight 510(k)s in the first 6 months of this year. So, that all builds to the momentum as we go forward here. Hope that helps. Yes, Joanne, thanks for the question. And you're right. I mean, through the pandemic, obviously, Veritor and BD MAX installed base did increase. We've not given specifics around exactly what those numbers are. We're very pleased. We continue to ship those platforms today. And if I break it down, so for Veritor right now, a lot of our focus is actually on converting the emergency authorizations that we got for COVID and our combination assays to 510(k). And obviously, once that is done, that would leave the Veritor, if you like, with approved assays for flu A, flu B, COVID, RSV, Strep A, which will really create a really nice anchor point of care clearway platform for infectious disease testing. So that is our focus there. For BD MAX, one of the big benefits of that platform that labs sees an attribute is its complete sample-to-answer automation and integration within a two to three hour window from sample to result. We placed many MAXs during the pandemic just for COVID and combination testing. And then when you think about the rest of the menu, we're now starting to drive adoption of our regular IVD assays. So, there are really two strategies. One is to increase assay utilization and assay penetration of our regular IVDs onto that BD MAX installed base and where we got emergency use authorization on BD MAX during the pandemic, like our quad assay for BD MAX, moving those EUAs to 510(k) as well. And [it's that] [ph] IVD traction and momentum that you've seen us sort of perform eight quarters double-digit growth."

            "name": "Mike Garrison",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. There's three sort of growth drivers that we've built in Medical. First, Pharm Systems, as Tom mentioned in the opening comments, 11 straight quarters of double-digit growth. And both the combination of our capacity investments, which we built a few years ago and continue to implement, plus our innovation, really to support the sensitive biologics and the requirements that those \u2013 that pipeline has coming towards us. We feel really good about that durable growth continuing. In MMS, we're really happy with the way that the teams have come together in pharmacy automation and our dispensing business. That connected med management and the tie around clinical efficiency both in the hospital as the hospitals start to shift care outside of the hospitals and how that ties into the retail markets, the long-term care markets. This is just a really ripe area for innovation, and we're really well-positioned now with that acquisition. It's going really well. And then in MDS, the Vascular Access Management strategy continues to do really well. Continues to resonate with customers, especially those aspects where it makes both the patient experience and the clinical experience a positive one. And so, we see \u2013 we don't necessarily look at it in terms of market position. We don't really comment on that. But we do look at it in terms of our WAMGRs. And we tend \u2013 we're showing growth over WAMGR. So, we feel good in that area as well. I'll turn it over to Rick or Dave."

So, first off, really pleased with the results in the quarter, 9.3% growth overall with all businesses contributing. And like you said, you pointed out surgery at almost 14%. And so, this strong performance across the segment really reflects the execution of our growth strategy across those key end markets that Chris pointed out, advanced repair and reconstruction, PVD, oncology, incontinence, and our newer innovations in higher growth areas are all really contributing nicely to growth. So, in UCC, we continue to see the growth of the PureWick franchise, aided by the recent launch of PureWick Male. PureWick continues to have really a strong presence in the acute and the alternate care setting for us for chronic incontinence and surgery. Like you said, growth is really driven by continued market adoption of Phasix, our hernia resorbable scaffold. Biosurgery growing double digits, aided by Arista. So, really good there. And then finally, in PI business, we're really \u2013 we're seeing improvements across our global supply chain as well as benefits of a lot of the strategic investments that we've made in the past. We have strong global penetration of Rotarex. We're really pleased with the relaunch of Venovo. And then our global expansion strategy is paying off, oncology in China is really strong. So, we feel confident with the overall external market conditions, including the recovery of elective procedures, improving their supply chain. And then you combine that with the success of, again, the strategic investments we've made, whether they be tuck-in M&A or products like as Tom mentioned, Rotarex, Phasix or with our new product launches such as PureWick Male. Team is executing extremely well, and we believe we have the right strategy to drive continued success."

I will also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines terms such as base revenues and continuing operations. With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Francesca. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1. Our results reflect the momentum of our BD2025 strategy, which we are driving through a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution. We exceeded our revenue and earnings expectations in Q1 despite market disruption in China and continue to drive consistent, durable performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 5.2% and $2.98 in adjusted diluted EPS. Our results are a testament to the continued relentless focus by our team of talented associates who are delivering BD products and solutions that are enabling our customers to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to patients around the world. In Q1, we continue to make excellent progress driving all three pillars of our strategy to accelerate growth, simplify the company and empower our associates. Our growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core, which has become known as the backbone of health care and our continued shift into attractive and higher growth end markets through investments in both R&D and tuck-in M&A. These higher-growth transformative solutions are focused in the three areas we see reshaping health care and where we are currently investing approximately 60% of our R&D. And that's in smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. Today, we have what I believe is the most exciting innovation pipeline in the history of the company. And through our investments, we are systematically increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio and supporting our strong growth profile. I'll have a few of the end markets that are driving our growth and some of the key products recently launched and in our pipeline that we're excited about. Our Medical segment is focused on improving medication delivery across a wide range of settings, making it safer, simpler and smarter across end markets that include medication management solutions, pharmacy automation, pharma and biotech drug delivery and vascular access management, where we recently launched PosiFlush SafeScrub, consistent with the expected launch timing we shared on our Q3 FY2022 call. A prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection device, PosiFlush SafeScrub, is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. It's a good example of how we're driving continuous innovation that extends our leadership in our durable core and within the broader $9 billion vascular access management market. Another milestone in our vascular access portfolio was clearance of our new PowerMe midline catheter by the Chinese regulatory agency NMPA. This was designed by our R&D center in China for China and is our first midline in this geography and offers up to 30 days of continuous venous access while reducing patient complications. We're excited about the opportunity PowerMe creates to help develop and category for vascular access in China, and we look forward to the expected launch later this quarter. Our BD Life Sciences segment provides solutions from sample collection and discovery to diagnosis and serves dynamic end markets like single cell analysis, clinical microbiology, point-of-care and the molecular diagnostics market, where we continue to advance our strategy of menu expansion with initial sales outside the U.S. of our BD MAX respiratory viral panel or RVP. This multiplex respiratory panel detects COVID-19, flu A and B and RSV in a single test and is an ideal solution for endemic respiratory testing. This aligns to our strategy to accelerate our growth in the $4 billion molecular diagnostics end market that's growing about 9%. The RVP panel is currently under FDA EUA review for U.S. launch. We also continue to progress our strategy in blood collection at the point-of-care. Point-of-care is one of the fastest-growing categories in diagnostics today that we believe will accelerate as diagnostic testing migrates to new and more convenient care settings such as retail clinics and pharmacies and even the potential of at home. Our BD MiniDraw capillary blood collection system is a disruptive innovation that enables collection of a high-quality blood sample without a venipuncture and is designed to provide a better patient experience across a broad range of care settings. We remain on track for 510(k) submission by the second half of FY2023. Our BD Interventional segment, which provides solutions for chronic disease management, serves end markets that dramatically improve people's lives, such as oncology, incontinence, advanced repair and reconstruction and the $5 billion peripheral vascular disease market, a space that's growing about 6%. Within PVD, we continued our strategy to globalize the BDI portfolio with the recent launch of our Venovo venous stent in China. The first stent in this market, specifically designed for iliofemoral venous disease. Within the $3 billion oncology end market, the space also growing about 6%, we achieved a significant milestone, completing safety testing for a multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy system, and we're on track for FDA submission and launch in FY2024. The BD multimodality VAB device is expected to be the first vacuum-assisted biopsy system designed to work across all three imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI, allowing customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training. These launches and milestones are good examples of how we're strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. Our purposeful strategic investments in R&D as well as tuck-in M&A and CapEx are supported by our strong flexible balance sheet and disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. This framework also gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. In Q1, we also continued to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio and most recently, our operating model. More specifically, we continue to make progress on our RECODE portfolio simplification program, where we are reducing SKUs of older generation products in order to focus on the most important products needed to deliver care today. We remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in more cost-effective locations. All of these efforts are designed to reduce complexity, drive supply chain excellence, and make BD more agile while supporting the achievement of our margin expansion goals. Our BD2025 strategy is balanced, robust and resilient. And our foresight planning and agility are enabling us to deliver strong performance despite the continued macro environment, challenging all companies. To share some perspective specific to health care, overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in line with our view that challenges are going to persist, not escalate at least through 2023. While inflation is easing in some areas, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically and have planned for another year of outsized inflation primarily in labor and raw materials. We see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles primarily in our manufacturing organization. Across raw materials, some categories of resins used in finished goods are beginning to show signs of improvement while other materials such as packaging and rubber are still inflated versus historic prices. In terms of the COVID pandemic, broadly speaking, we see stabilization. While there continues to be surges in certain pockets around the world, similar to our customers, we have become more accustomed to managing through COVID-driven dynamics and have been effective at avoiding any extended manufacturing and distribution disruptions. Specific to China, we anticipate that the recent COVID restrictions that impacted us in Q1 will affect our peers as well. Our local teams are navigating these restrictions well, which reflects the resiliency and strength of our China organization and the diversity and durability of our business. By successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to continue delivering strong performance. Before I turn it over to Chris, I\u2019ll share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. In December, we published our second annual ID&E report, which provides details about our progress towards our 2030 ESG goals for promoting a healthy workforce and communities. The report highlights our improvements towards increasing diversity at the management and executive levels and spotlights our global associates who are advancing our culture and driving meaningful change within BD and the communities that we serve. We also published our third annual cybersecurity report. BD was the first in med tech to outline our ongoing efforts to advance cybersecurity in a report, including our work to protect against cyber-attacks and empower customers with information about cyber risks and vulnerabilities. We\u2019re proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts, most recently being named for the fourth consecutive year to both Newsweek\u2019s list of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies, ranking in the top 25%, and the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, recognizing our ongoing commitment to workplace equality. In summary, I\u2019m proud of our progress and momentum. Our associates are bringing our BD2025 strategy to life as we operate as a more agile, innovative med tech leader. BD is well positioned to drive profitable growth and create long-term value. First, our growth profile is consistent and durable. Second, we are enhancing our leadership positions through purposeful portfolio shifts into higher-growth markets, increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio. Third, we are improving our margin profile through our differentiated growth, enhanced simplification programs and ongoing supply chain excellence. And fourth, we are committed to remaining disciplined and maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. We see an increasing capacity through our BD2025 time frame to support value creation and continued strong growth through tuck-in M&A. All of this adds up to a compelling financial profile with a long-term targeted base revenue growth of 5.5% plus and double-digit EPS growth. Our updated guidance for FY 2023 reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve these targets. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom\u2019s comments, we delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile in our BD2025 strategy, playing out as planned. So first, beginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, delivering $4.6 billion in revenue with base business growth of 5.2% or 3% organic. We see underlying organic growth more at mid-single-digits when adjusting for strategic product exits, the licensing fee comparison in life sciences, and several COVID-driven comparisons. COVID-only testing revenues were $32 million, which is expected, declined from $185 million last year. Total company base business growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with approximately 6% growth. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 3.3% reflects the comparison to licensing revenues that impacted growth by almost 400 basis points. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Revenues in China declined slightly, which reflects the impact of COVID restrictions, offset by strong performance from new product introductions in BDI and research solutions in BDB. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver near double-digit growth in China. Our base business revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio, and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions in our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter. Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment\u2019s performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today\u2019s earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 6.1%. BD Medical performance reflects strong growth in both Medication Management Solutions and Pharm Systems, which more than offset a decline in Medication Delivery Solutions. The decline in MDS of 1% was driven by COVID-related comparisons and the impact of recent COVID restrictions in China as well as planned strategic portfolio exits. We continue to see strong performance in Vascular Access Management outside the U.S. Double-digit growth of 15.5% in MMS was driven by strong demand for our pharmacy automation solutions, including both Parata and Rowa. We\u2019ve been very pleased with customer response and the performance of Parata. As expected, growth in MMS also reflects the comparison to higher dispensing installations and infusion set utilization in the prior year driven by COVID dynamics. We continue to have a very healthy backlog of customer orders for Pyxis and BD HealthSight, which reflects the strength of our connected medication management portfolio. And despite strong growth of 18% in Q1 of last year, Pharm Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by continued penetration in the high-growth biologic and vaccine markets. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. The decline of 7.3% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues. Life Sciences base revenues grew over 7%, excluding the licensing grow over as previously discussed. Growth was driven by growth in Integrated Diagnostic Solutions base revenue of 1.3%, or 6.4% when excluding the licensing comparison. This strong underlying mid-single-digit growth was driven by BD Kiestra that is helping to address laboratory labor shortages through automation and informatics and continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD Max installed base. In addition, there was strong demand for our respiratory testing portfolio that was partly aided by the timing of orders. High single-digit growth of 9.2% in Biosciences reflects continued growth from new product launches combined with strong double-digit growth in research reagents, enabled by our differentiated content and dye strategy. We continue to see demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry analyzers and sorters as researchers continue to do even higher parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 5.6%. Growth was driven by surgery growth of 3.1%, which reflects strong performance in advanced repair and reconstruction driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix, Hernia, resorbable scaffold and double-digit growth in biosurgery, aided by the Tissuemed acquisition. Growth in surgery was tempered by planned strategic portfolio exits and then expected decline in BD ChloraPrep due to a tough comparison to the prior year as a result of dealer stocking. Peripheral Intervention grew 10.8%, which reflects double-digit growth in PVD, driven by the Venovo relaunch, coupled with continued global penetration of Rotarex, and the acquisition of Venclose, which addresses chronic venous insufficiency. Additionally, growth was strong in oncology, within Greater Asia due to an improved backlog situation associated with prior year supplier constraints. Urology growth of 1.8% reflects double-digit growth in our PureWick, chronic, incontinence solutions and endourology that benefited from reduced back order due to improved supplier performance. Offsetting this strong performance was a difficult comparison in urological drainage due to shore step back order release and distributor stocking in the prior year. Now moving to our P&L. We reported Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.98, which included gross margin of 54.7% and operating margin of 22.9% that were consistent with our expectations. While we are no longer providing a specific breakout of the impact to margins from COVID-only testing, you will recall the comparison to higher testing in the prior year is weighted to the first half and as expected is the driver of the decline in reported Q1 margins year-over-year. Excluding the COVID impacts to margins in Q1 of both years, both gross and operating margins in our base business were up slightly year-over-year. The improvement in base margins was delivered despite around 350 basis points of outsized inflation that as expected was primarily driven by selling through inventory that included peak inflation impacts from FY 2022, such as increases in certain raw materials noted earlier as well as the impact of labor inflation and elevated shipping. We were able to offset a large portion of this impact to our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and the benefit from strategic portfolio access of lower-margin products as planned. We expect the impact from inflation to moderate as we move through the year. Base margin performance also includes growing over the impact from licensing revenues in the prior year. As expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flow through sales. R&D of 6.4% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Q1 reflects timing of project spend. We expect R&D to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-range target of 6%. Our tax rate in Q1 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that were planned for during the year. Regarding our cash and capital allocation; cash flows from operations totaled approximately $400 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow reflects an impact of approximately $300 million from higher inventory balances. The increase reflects the impact of inflation and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand. We've seen good progress in December and January on WIP [ph] and finished goods rightsizing with January inventory dollars down sequentially from December. We are working to moderate strategic raw material purchases as stability improves in select markets. However, we continue to make prudent trade-offs where necessary to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results. Assuming continued stabilization of the macro environment and supply chain, we expect to continue to manage inventory levels down and by the end of the fiscal year had this be a positive source of cash and meaningful progress towards meeting our long-term cash conversion goals. We paid down approximately $500 million in long-term debt in Q1 and ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $600 million and a net leverage ratio of 3 times. As the year progresses and we build cash, we can increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our first quarter performance, we are confident in increasing our revenue and EPS guidance, given the strength of our base revenue growth, consistent execution of our margin goals, and reflecting the latest FX rates. Starting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well positioned for strong growth across our three segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations despite the impact of restrictions in China, and thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75%. This is an increase of 50 basis points from our prior guidance of 5.25% to 6.25% and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our consistent durable growth profile. Our base revenue guidance continues to include planned strategic portfolio exits that will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter most to our customers. We initiated these actions in Q1 and for the full year, continue to expect the impact to base revenue growth of approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin. Offsetting this revenue impact, we continue to expect a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions with Parata being the predominant driver. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata; Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comps and Interventional to be above the midpoint.  For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million to $100 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $125 million to $175 million and is driven by reduced testing volumes and the continued shift in the market to combination testing for respiratory illness. Regarding Alaris, we continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in line with fiscal 2022 demand.  Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points while absorbing the decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to mitigate inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving operating margin levels of about 25% in fiscal year 2025.  We continue to expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A [ph], driven by internal cost containment and leverage. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales.  Below operating income, our assumptions regarding interest, other and tax remain unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 350 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing, which is about 50 basis points more than we previously anticipated. As a result, this implies a very strong low-teens base earnings growth of approximately 12.5% to 14.5% compared to 12% to 14% previously anticipated.  Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in November, the U.S. dollar weakened against all of our major currencies. Based on current spot rates, which assumes the euro at $1.08 for the remainder of the year. For illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points, or about $370 million to total company revenues on a full year basis, which is an improvement of approximately 250 basis points compared to our prior view.  The currency headwind to adjusted EPS growth has also declined significantly since our November earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 230 basis points to adjusted EPS growth compared to approximately 420 basis points previously.  All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $500 million to a range of $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion compared to $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion previously and are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.07 and $12.32, which is an increase of $0.22 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance range of $11.85 to $12.10.  As we think of fiscal 2023 phasing, there are various items to consider. We have outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note. First, regarding margins. We expect Q2 operating margin to be similar to our FY 2022 full year margin. This demonstrates our strong focus on profitable growth given the continued impact of inflation and the grow-over impact of our COVID-only testing revenue, both of which we expect to be most prominent in the first half of the year. As a reminder, COVID-only testing has a higher margin and reinvestment of COVID-only testing profit was weighted to the back half of the year. As the year progresses and we continue to benefit from our simplification and inflation mitigation programs, we anticipate margin expansion to be most prominent and to increase through the second half. Second, regarding FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue and EPS will be over-indexed to the first half with about 90% of the full year impact to revenue and about 80% of the full year impact to EPS occurring in the first half. For the full year, we expect the FX drop-through to earnings to be in line with our BDX operating margin.  Lastly, a couple of timing items to note. We expect R&D as a percentage of sales to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-term target of 6%. Additionally, the midpoint of our full year effective tax rate guidance indicates an effective tax rate over 16% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly throughout the year as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict.  In closing, we are very pleased with our performance, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile and our BD 2025 strategy continuing to progress as planned. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business.  With that, let me turn it back to Tom for few additional comments. \nTom Polen: Thanks, Chris. The future has never been brighter for BD. We have demonstrated a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution and have the talent, vision and momentum to continue delivering robust performance.  As we move through the back half of the fiscal year, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of our strategy. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.  With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Tom, maybe at a high level, when I look at this guidance here and Q1 performance, I think your prior comments were Q1 organic to be a couple of 100 basis points below the annual guide. And I'm looking at the annual guide \u2013 prior annual guide of 4.75, which included the product exits. So I think the Street was looking at sub 3%. You came in at 3%, slightly better. But the base here was increased by 50 basis points. It looks like underlying business momentum is accelerating. So maybe just talk about what's giving you confidence? I think you mentioned some new products. So what's driving this confidence in organic guide raise?\nTom Polen: Good morning Vijay. And thanks for the great question. I'll turn that over to Chris.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Maybe a couple of macro comments. One, I just think this represents another quarter of strong execution, consistent with what we shared overall. When you think of our kind of forward-looking view from our updated guidance, I think, a few key things, not that we highlighted and then I'll address your question maybe with where we see some pockets of strength. But one, we did increase to your point, 50 basis points of growth on our base business. That strength is pretty broad-based when you think of it. I'll come back to that. And that's despite the fact that you had the restrictions and impacts in China as well. So we more than absorbed that. We also absorbed the COVID-only testing revenue, which given the testing dynamics in the marketplace are not surprisingly down when you think of COVID only relative to our position in the market. That's a higher-margin offering, and we absorbed that as well. I think importantly, we continue to execute against our margin, and we committed to our \u2013 at least 100 basis points of margin improvement and then we incorporated FX. Yes, and to your point, when we're entering the year, I mean, one, Q1 is still under-indexed relative to our full year guide. Right? So that still holds together. We know there was about 100 basis points of headwind associated with the licensing revenue impact in our Life Sciences business that you saw in our results. We had estimated there is maybe about another 100 basis points of other dynamics, comp-related issues, mostly attributed to COVID. We also had some difficult comps in the quarter in certain areas like pharma systems, for example, grew 18%, Q1 last year, and we still delivered north of 10% growth in this quarter. So, I think that continues to be a source of strength for us. I think the flu season, there is probably a timing dynamic there. It peaked a bit earlier than we thought and was a higher spike. As we go through this call, Dave can certainly amplify that, but it's played out like it's played out in other areas with a quick season that's going to abate. So I think you have a timing dynamic there as well. So there is various items such as that. But largely speaking, I think, things are very consistent. We feel really good about the first quarter of the year, and it gave us confidence to increase our guidance.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then just one follow-up for me, Chris. And perhaps, Tom, you can chime in. One on, did you \u2013 a few questions here on combo and flu revenue contribution. I think on the prior call you had said you expect somewhere around 150-ish for the year. Did the estimate change? What was the China impact here in the quarter? And Chris, did I hear you correctly on gross margins? Should they be up sequentially here into 2Q? Or should gross margins be flattish or down?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, real quick on gross margin, we didn't give specific guidance on gross margin, we more \u2013 just to give you kind of an anchor how to expect Q2 to play out. We said it would be in line roughly with how we ended our full year fiscal year 2022, which when you think of the inflationary environment we're in, in the first half of the year, right, we talked about peak inflation rolling through in Q1 and Q2. We had a 350 basis point impact of inflationary pressure in Q1. And so, a Q2 margin similar to how we exited the year is what we're thinking. We did not specifically highlight gross margin.\nTom Polen: Vijay, on the other two questions that you asked, on China specifically, so China declined slightly in the quarter, obviously due to the COVID impact. We did see at the end of this month \u2013 last month, January, starting to see some recovery there. So, we're optimistic for the year, we still \u2013 as you know, we delivered double-digit growth in China. Last year, we said high singles or near double or about that this year, and that's unchanged. We think we will be able to recover in the back portion of this year. We still have our four-pronged strategy that we have in China we remain very confident in. We've got a very strong team there that's been navigating that challenging environment. Again, they delivered 10% plus growth in 2022, and we expect another strong 2023. And that strategy that focuses on bringing our global pipeline to China continuing to drive China tailored R&D. And you heard us talk about a new launch there in the midline of a product developed in China for China. We continue to move in to expand our market coverage into lower-tier settings, continue to manage through the BOBP where it exists, that's in our run rate. And we continue to strengthen our local presence in China, both our manufacturing presence as well as clinical expertise as we continue to train thousands and thousands of clinicians each year. That formula has worked very well for us in the past, and we continue to double down on that. I think as we think about the combo test, I'll turn that over to Dave to speak a little bit about what we're seeing there.\nDave Hickey: Thanks, Tom. Hey Vijay, good to hear you. Thanks for the question. Yes, so just on COVID and combo, as I think about both of those. I mean, as you saw in the quarter, we posted COVID-only revenues of $32 million. And as we said on the call, we now expect COVID only for the full year to be between $50 million and $100 million. I think Chris commented right, we are seeing obviously stabilization in the market. We are seeing a decline in testing for COVID only. Actually, as that testing shifts to these combination tests, and actually, for us, in Q1, our performance in that area did actually help offset that COVID-only decline. We had anticipated that that's the way that was going to become the standard of care. I'm actually very proud of the team in terms of the way they sort of anticipated and reacted and built these combination test supplies to support the Q1 performance. And I think if you think about the installed base that we've grown on BD MAX, the fact that we've released these combination assays on both BD MAX, BD Veritor, BD COR actually now in Europe is CE-marked. I think that dynamic, and we can talk about it later, the dynamic of what that looks like for the full year on the respiratory testing obviously continues to play out. But yes, COVID only, we definitely see a decline.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, did the prior guidance on that, I think you mentioned 150-ish for the year. Did that change?\nDave Hickey: Yes. So for the year, we think COVID only now will be in the range of $50 million to $100 million.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, on the combo test. I think flu combo...\nDave Hickey: So, yes. So, we never really \u2013 so, if I think about that, the way \u2013 if you think about what we said from a, let's say, a flu season pre-pandemic, we had said that was always in the $75 million to about $100 million range on the antigen testing and so on and so forth. There is obviously a lot of unknowns right now in terms of how the full year is going to play out. Obviously, quarter one, we saw the season start early, if you track those CDC graphs, we saw the season start early, it peaked, and we were able to respond to that. If we were looking at it now and for all the assumptions we have, we would think it will be about 1.5 times, let's say, a normal season. So $75 million to $100 million, we would say 1.5 times. And that's really enabled and driven by the installed base increases that we have and the fact that we have developed to launch these combination sets across those platforms.\nOperator: Okay, we'll take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sorry for the delay there. So, congrats on quarter, even though I'm not a \u2013 usually congrats on a good quarter guy, but that was very nice. So...\nTom Polen: We appreciate that, Matt. Thank you.\nMatt Taylor: Of course, Tom. I had a question, a follow-up on Chris\u2019 comments on just the operating margin expansion improvement being more back-half weighted. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about that and maybe unpack that and talk about the sources of it just because there\u2019s been so many moving parts and it\u2019s an important part of the story.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. No problem. Thanks, Matt. I appreciate the question. Yes, things are pretty consistent with what we shared when we started the year, and it seems to be playing out as such. Some of the key factors to contemplate. First of all, we talked about that from a full year standpoint, inflationary headwinds being another 200-plus basis points. This is on the back of two other years with last year also being over 200 basis points. So, we\u2019ve been navigating an extremely challenging macro environment, right, when you think of that on a cumulative basis. What we did say around the inflationary pressures, it would be significantly weighted towards the first half of the year will be highlighted in Q1 that you saw flow through because a lot of this was inventory that was built last year that sold through. 350 basis points of outsized inflation. That\u2019s on top of, I think, of normal inflation merit increases that everyone takes that would happen in any kind of environment, more of those 3% level. So, you\u2019re really talking about, call it, 400 basis points plus of costs that you have to contend with within your P&L. So then when you think of the mitigation offset to that, so -- by the way, so when you think of our Q1 performance and margin on the back of a 350 basis point inflationary pressure in the quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with how we started the year, because we knew the front half was going to be kind of the more challenging times. As we progress through the back half, there\u2019s a few things that will play out. One, it starts with our internal focus on cost improvement initiatives, simplify, whether it be Project RECODE, driving outsized cost improvement through our plants and other facilities. We\u2019re very focused on portfolio, whether it be driving mix. We took this bold strategic action around portfolio product exits that contributed within the quarter. And so, you don\u2019t do this was one thing. The strong growth rate, of course, gives you natural leverage. And then as we go through the back half of the year, while we\u2019ll still be in an elevated inflationary environment, the cost of materials will subside. You\u2019re seeing some of that subside in certain pockets of raw materials as an example, while other areas, like labor is continuing to persist. But you should see it trend down from that 350 basis points to get to our average of over 200 basis points that we talked about. So then when you think of kind of the dynamics within the P&L between GP and operating margin and where it will play out, GP, we said would be largely in line to just a slight improvement for the full year. And again, that goes back to the fact that we\u2019re absorbing the significant inflationary pressures. So, you\u2019re doing a lot of work to kind of stay flat to slightly above. And then the majority of it will end up showing up in operating margin as you think of leveraging your cost base there, some cost improvement actions we\u2019re also taking in OpEx, and we also continue to normalize our R&D spend in the second half. If you saw in Q1, and we expected in Q2 to have more outsized R&D above 6%, so the back half will be below 6% to normalize to our 6% rate. So, I think those are the biggest puts and takes as you think of the year, but we\u2019re very pleased again with Q1, how we started and how focused we\u2019ve been on the margin profile.\nMatt Taylor: Okay. I mean that was very comprehensive. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for taking the question and I\u2019ll reiterate my congratulations on the nice quarter here. Chris, just one follow-up to Matt\u2019s question. How much visibility do you have? I mean, the second half margin ramp is pretty strong. How much visibility do you have on that? And trying to calculate the numbers here quickly, but it implies, I think, pretty low OpEx growth, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Just color on that, please?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Larry. There\u2019s a few things that obviously, I would call naturally. Well, kind of like, for example, we had reinvestment of the higher COVID-only margin from the first half and reinvestment was in the back half. That will stop. We talked about timing differences of the R&D spend. I mean, you got a 50 basis point swing just timing there from first half to second half as an example. I had also indicated on the call some of the SSG&A [ph] that we had incurred in Q1, there\u2019s timing elements there. So there\u2019s timing elements in probably R&D, SSG&A. You have the lack of reinvestment that you just stopped at. Those were onetime in nature. The other dynamic that you have in GP that I mentioned is the trend of some abatement while still elevated, but it\u2019s all on a relative basis of the raw material cost in the second half in GP. Short of something significant changing, we have pretty strong line of sight to those dynamics. And then from there, it\u2019s really just continuing the rhythm of our cost improvement initiatives. So, I think to your point, obviously, the macro environment has been fluctuating. So, we keep monitoring that. But I think given where we are, we feel pretty confident and we\u2019re certainly well on track to deliver the, at least 100 basis points of improvement for the year.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s helpful. And just one quick follow-up. Tom, it looks like Parata is doing really well. I mean the $86 million inorganic contribution in Medical. It looks like there was one other acquisition there, but I assume most of it\u2019s Parata. So any color on how Parata is doing? It looks like it\u2019s doing better than the initial expectations. Thanks.\nTom Polen: Larry, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re at or actually a bit ahead of the deal model there. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with Parata. And we\u2019ve got Mike here in the room. So let me turn it over to Mike to talk about what the other acquisition is that\u2019s in those numbers and a bit more about Parata.\nMike Garrison: Yes. The other acquisition is the acquisition of MedKeeper. That\u2019s a pharmacy automation software that helps automate the processes that a pharmacy tech would use to prepare IV medications in the pharmacy hood. So that contributed a small amount into that acquisition number. From a Parata perspective, I think what we\u2019re seeing there, and we are really pleased with it, is the combination of the energy and the product that Parata provides and the energy that the people from Parata are providing, along with the sort of discipline and coaching that BD and the scale that we provide to access new markets, access acute care settings and help drive the transformation of the pharmacy for acute care. So Parata is continuing to grow very strong in the alternate site in the retail area. And then we\u2019re starting to open up the discussions with IDNs that are looking to transform their pharmacy operations. So I think that bodes really well for the future. We are very pleased with it, and we hope to continue to see the same type of response from our customers.\nTom Polen: I think we \u2013 fair to say, Larry, we don\u2019t see any change in the trajectory around the macro factors that are driving demand for that, right? The labor shortages, the need to repurpose pharmacists to do more things in the retail setting, like wellness checks and vaccines and address patients, all of that, right, drives the demand for automation and robotics. And it\u2019s really a great example of our smart connected care strategy, one of the three transformational areas that we\u2019re focused on. It\u2019s a great example of us bringing that to life. So really good momentum in the Medical segment there.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Good morning and congrats on nice quarter. Chris, maybe to dig into some of the points you made already. COVID testing is a high-margin business going down. How much of the base business upside in guidance is coming from the combo COVID test? And then a lot of competitors are outperforming on COVID testing and potentially raising numbers for the year. I guess, how are you thinking about just Becton, Dickinson in the framework of COVID testing and your assumptions underlying how testing will be used for the balance of the year? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Yes. Good question, Robbie. So I'll start with the COVID and Dave can add in here. But I would say a few things. One is, so our COVID testing as you know is primarily in professional settings. And when we talk about our \u2013 and molecular, to a degree as well, too, we don't have a strong presence in At Home. We do have an At Home test, but it's not it's a \u2013 it's not nearly as big of a presence as in our professional setting. So I think perhaps where you see the most outsized performance there is in company \u2013 is from companies with a large At Home presence where you've just seen a lot of the COVID testing migrate to At Home versus in professional settings since it's so easy to do and people can do that without going into a clinician. So I think that's one factor probably influencing some of the delta for us. As you know, we do have a combo test in development for At Home, and we'll share once we get that, hopefully that EUA and able to launch that. Dave, any other comments to add there on COVID?\nDave Hickey: Yes. Hey Robbie. I mean I think, Tom, you captured well. I think when we did our At Home COVID test; we made a very deliberate decision to pursue a digital strategy. You saw the acquisition that we made of Scanwell. We were very much aligned to the test, treat and trace reporting dynamics. And we intentionally sort of targeted that digital ecosystem with a higher price, higher margin rather than the visually red at-home test. We still think on a go-forward basis, as the sort of, let's say, the sort of the government contracts and things abate, as testing perhaps becomes more regulated At Home, 510(k) environments and so on, a digital ecosystem, again plays into the smart connected care of BD will be important. But I think for us, we just look at it all as we're seeing the softening in the COVID decline. We firmly believe that the standard of care going forward will be these \u2013 in an endemic type of approach, these combination tests and we've built a portfolio across BD MAX, BD COR, Veritor and potentially Veritor At-Home across all of these combination portfolios.\nTom Polen: I think the good thing, Robbie that we would look at as is that we're really getting more to a durable revenue number in that, right? So I think as we look at 2023, it's a number that could be very much in line with how we think about it playing out in future years as well at that level where there's not still significantly high numbers that would drop in the future that were really at a kind of a durable level of performance in those categories. Chris, any other?\nChris DelOrefice: Well, just the way you started your question, Robbie. So if you think of us absorbing the COVID-only and increasing our base revenue guidance by the 50 basis points, it wasn't like a swap out into combination testing. It was actually broadly based across the business. As Dave mentioned earlier, we still see the combo part of our portfolio at that 1.5 times, and we'll continue to watch how it plays out. There was a little bit of strength there, but it wasn't outsized relative to the other areas we also had stressed.\nTom Polen: Typically, yes. Just to add we typically wouldn't raise unless it was a highly unusual situation, trying to predict expectations on a full year basis on flu or a flu combo test just because it can drop off so quickly. And in fact, we are seeing, right, that's happening if you look at the CDC charts, those charts are showing significant drop-off like what happened in Australia. Rapid early peak and then a rapid drop, unclear if there could be second or third peaks in the future, but that's not something we can easily predict. So typically in Q1, we try to be conservative around that \u2013 those outlooks in that specific product category. More after Q2, we get a sense of where the full year plays out.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.\nTom Polen: Thanks.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next on Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Hey thanks. Wanted to follow-up with a couple of questions; one on sort of the margin side and then just a couple of clarifications on the revenue side. And just too sort of maybe summarize and make sure we've got a clear understanding of the sort of dynamics this year. I mean you have these significant restructuring efforts underway that you've talked about, that sounds like on a full year basis you're expecting those to kind of offset the inflationary \u2013 outsized inflationary cost at the COGS line, at the gross margin line? I'm guessing you're probably not fully offsetting those here in the first half. But as you pointed out, that 350 basis point of inflationary hedge or inflationary pressure are going to sort of ease in the back half. So full year, you sort of manage that to sort of neutral and then the benefits that you're getting here to get you to that 100 basis points really happened below the gross profit line in the form of leverage, in the form of timing as you pointed out. Is that the right way to think about the overall margin picture front half, back half, just to summarize and make sure I'm clear on it anyway? And then as \u2013 I have a couple of quick revenue follow-ups.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. I think that \u2013 I mean, there's other puts and takes within there. But generally speaking, yes, that's how we see the year playing out.\nMatt Miksic: Great. And then on the revenue side, just some other folks who have had some China pressure in the quarter as you did and obviously managed through that to deliver the beat here. But if you could maybe quantify that is sort of one clarification is give a sense of what the growth might have been if it's a 50 basis point overall hit to growth on the clarification on the combo testing, COVID testing changes that you made in terms of your expectation of COVID-only testing. It sounds like that's \u2013 that maybe not so much of an expectation that COVID testing in total is coming down, but it sounds like it's a bit more of a mix shift that's just \u2013 you're getting COVID testing in the form of that combo testing. So not directionally inconsistent, it seems with what other folks are talking about. They just don't have that combust [ph] exposure. And then I'll leave it there just with those two clarifying points would be super helpful? Thanks.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. I think just real quick on China. Thanks, Matt, for the questions. So I mean, last year is just an interesting proxy, right? We went through restrictions in our fiscal Q3. Despite that, we navigated. We had an impact in the quarter. We actually still grew in that quarter last year and posted around double-digit growth in fiscal year 2022. This quarter, we saw a modest decline, 1%, and in China specifically, and normally if you think of it as a double-digit growth business. With that said, Q1 last year, was a strong comp for us in China. We had a very strong quarter for various dynamics, including some new products that were introduced, et cetera. So we would say the impact is probably just south of 50 basis points, if you want to think about it, plus or minus in the quarter headwind just to give you some direction. We did highlight we still feel great, as Tom mentioned earlier, with the core strategy with that business, short of like further disruptions occurring this year and these being a more kind of acute. We should see again around double-digit growth for the year is what we had shared. So we did see some trends, recent trends, like we're watching it. So we're watching it closely, but it looks like you're starting to kind of see some turnaround in that market. It's still early. So we'll look at it and we'll update, of course, in Q2. But I think longer term, our strategy and performance in China is really strong.\nTom Polen: I think just to add in there, we had seen even versus the first half of January to the back half of January, we started seeing good recovery towards the back half of January as the COVID outbreak began to subside. \nChris DelOrefice: Yes. I think, COVID, I can let Dave and Tom jump in here too, kind of half accurate, I think, in your depiction. There\u2019s significant market dynamics on call it, COVID-only testing in the marketplace this year. If you think of last year, there was a lot of government intervention and school requirements and businesses. I mean there\u2019s \u2013 a lot of that has subsided. So there\u2019s a portion of the reduced testing that\u2019s just market dynamics playing out in terms of total volume, and that\u2019s not just shifting the combination testing.  With that said, we still feel good about our combo assay in having that because we do see that as the assay of choice as folks have are symptomatic going in and want to get tested for flu. So we saw strength in our platform. But as Dave articulated, the flu season did kind of spike early. So we\u2019ll have to kind of continue to watch that as we navigate through Q2. So it certainly wasn\u2019t a one-for-one shift by any means, not even really close to that. \nDave Hickey: Yes. And I think the only other things that I would talk about, Matt. Just in terms of the market dynamics, we track things like bed occupancy and so on really closely. And if you look at a lot of the data sort of in our first quarter and sort of beds that were occupied by COVID-only patients was like maximum peak of like 6%, which is way down from sort of north of 22% in sort of prior period. So that COVID-only dynamics is definitely softening.  And I mean I\u2019ll just reinforce what I said earlier on around these combination assays where the unmet need is if somebody presented symptomatically and you want to know, particularly in the respiratory season, do I have COVID, do I have flu, do I have RSV, we think that is going to be the norm on a go-forward basis. And I think we talked earlier on that we have those on MAX outside the U.S., on Veritor.  Two things I would also highlight that is for the combination assay here in the U.S., we are under EUA review with the FDA right now. And actually, just late \u2013 or BD MAX, yes. And late last month, we actually did file our EUA for an at-home combination assay. So there are also two EUAs that are under review right now. Who \u2013 as I said, right now, the season is extremely quiet. But this is also about us planning and preparing for whatever the respiratory season may be towards the end of this calendar year. \nTom Polen: Thanks Dave. Thanks Matt. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nTom Polen: Good morning, Rick.\nRick Wise: Good morning to you. Let me start off with new products. Tom, I was looking for the last couple of quarters, handouts here. And I don\u2019t recall, but it feels like starting off with innovation in our handouts and the passion with which you review everything is \u2013 tells us all something very important about the direction you\u2019re heading. And I was just curious from two angles. Which do you see \u2013 which would you want us to view as the most impactful to growth margins and to the franchises, which are you most focused on? And separate, but related, maybe you know that, as Chris highlighted, the balance sheet\u2019s getting back in such excellent shape, what are your priorities? It\u2019s clearly tuck-in, but is there any sort of franchise or technology or area we should be thinking about?\nTom Polen: Great questions, Rick. Thank you. So on the innovation side; obviously, we appreciate the comments there. We\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that we have. And as I\u2019ve said many times, we think we have the most exciting pipeline in the company\u2019s history. If you look at last year in FY 2022, we had 25 new product launches, things like our HealthSight diversion management moving into the operating room or the new Pyxis ES platform or a series of new dyes and the first of their kind in BDB or our core high-throughput platform. Asprex [ph] in the U.S. or PureWick Male are all great examples of products that we launched last year that are going to help drive growth this year.  As we think about \u2013 and we highlighted quite a few this quarter as well. As we look ahead, as you know, there\u2019s no \u2013 you can\u2019t say for BD, hey, there\u2019s these three or four products that are going to drive our performance and that if they go really well or don\u2019t go as well, that it\u2019s going to change our outlook and our thesis. That\u2019s one of the strengths of BD. We\u2019ve got a lot of singles, a lot of doubles. We\u2019ve got triples here and there. But we\u2019ve got a deep bench. What\u2019s \u2013 what I\u2019d point you to is we\u2019ve been systematically moving our portfolio into higher-growth markets and shifting our WAMGR up. We talked a lot about that at JPMorgan this year. We gave updates specifically on our progress versus the WAMGR goals that we set at Analyst Day two years ago, and we\u2019re very much on track to those. We\u2019re really pleased with how our portfolio is progressing.  We\u2019re really pleased with how we\u2019re executing R&D. We\u2019ve shared before we exited FY 2022 with our best performance ever, 87% on-time launches, 84% milestone delivery. That\u2019s up significantly versus where we\u2019ve been in the past, and so we\u2019re pleased with how our R&D team is performing.  We highlighted quite a few of the many exciting launches that we have coming up this year or submissions that we have. Certainly, think about Life Sciences, facts discover is a breakthrough new platform. Any time you\u2019re on the cover of Science Magazine, we\u2019ll consider that an exciting technology, and we\u2019re launching that later this year. A lot of exciting interest from our customers as well as the new dyes that are associated with that to take advantage of the spectral technology and in FACSDiscover. YODA around capillary blood collection, enabling blood collection by non-phlebotomists, non-venepuncture, really highly preferred by patients. 75 out of 100 will prefer or more blood being drawn with that device than a venepuncture. And we see that as starting to enable more routine care in places, like retail. When you look at the majority of clinical decisions being driven by diagnostic data it\u2019s hard for care to move into new settings if you\u2019re not getting that diagnostic data available there. You still got to go into the old system. They have your blood drawn. We\u2019re working to change that. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to be excited about as we go forward. In BD Medical, obviously, we\u2019ve got products and pharm systems that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, including Libertas as well as new vaccine delivery solutions that we\u2019ve launched recently in BDI, we\u2019ve talked about quite a few. We highlighted PureWick in the past, PosiFlush in MDS, list goes on again in JPMorgan went through those pretty deeply, and I highlighted a few here on the call today.  I think as we think about tuck-in M&A, we\u2019re going to remain extremely disciplined. I\u2019ve shared in the past, of course, many times, we\u2019re still focused on tuck-in M&A exclusively. We\u2019re very focused on maintaining that strong balance sheet that we have, and we are going to continue to increase the amount of cash that we generate, and we feel really good about how that looks over the next several years.  We have our very focused priorities. We don\u2019t disclose specific market categories that we\u2019re focused on there. But we\u2019ve obviously pointed very specifically to three areas of focus around smart connected care, around technologies that enable the shift to new care settings and around technologies that help us improve chronic disease outcomes in the chronic disease spaces that we\u2019re focused in, like oncology, peripheral vascular disease, et cetera. And so, over the last three years, 90% plus of the M&A dollars that we\u2019ve spent have been focused in those three categories, and we would certainly expect that continue going forward, that level of focus. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks. \nTom Polen: I just want to thank everyone for your time today. Great series of questions. Obviously, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel really good about the performance as we started this year, and we look forward to providing updates in the future. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, and that does conclude today\u2019s audio webcast. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on the BD Investor Relations website. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Mike Garrison",
            "content": "Yes. The other acquisition is the acquisition of MedKeeper. That's a pharmacy automation software that helps automate the processes that a pharmacy tech would use to prepare IV medications in the pharmacy hood. So that contributed a small amount into that acquisition number. From a Parata perspective, I think what we're seeing there, and we are really pleased with it, is the combination of the energy and the product that Parata provides and the energy that the people from Parata are providing, along with the sort of discipline and coaching that BD and the scale that we provide to access new markets, access acute care settings and help drive the transformation of the pharmacy for acute care. So Parata is continuing to grow very strong in the alternate site in the retail area. And then we're starting to open up the discussions with IDNs that are looking to transform their pharmacy operations. So I think that bodes really well for the future. We are very pleased with it, and we hope to continue to see the same type of response from our customers."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Francesca. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1. Our results reflect the momentum of our BD2025 strategy, which we are driving through a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution. We exceeded our revenue and earnings expectations in Q1 despite market disruption in China and continue to drive consistent, durable performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 5.2% and $2.98 in adjusted diluted EPS. Our results are a testament to the continued relentless focus by our team of talented associates who are delivering BD products and solutions that are enabling our customers to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to patients around the world. In Q1, we continue to make excellent progress driving all three pillars of our strategy to accelerate growth, simplify the company and empower our associates. Our growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core, which has become known as the backbone of health care and our continued shift into attractive and higher growth end markets through investments in both R&D and tuck-in M&A. These higher-growth transformative solutions are focused in the three areas we see reshaping health care and where we are currently investing approximately 60% of our R&D. And that's in smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. Today, we have what I believe is the most exciting innovation pipeline in the history of the company. And through our investments, we are systematically increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio and supporting our strong growth profile. I'll have a few of the end markets that are driving our growth and some of the key products recently launched and in our pipeline that we're excited about. Our Medical segment is focused on improving medication delivery across a wide range of settings, making it safer, simpler and smarter across end markets that include medication management solutions, pharmacy automation, pharma and biotech drug delivery and vascular access management, where we recently launched PosiFlush SafeScrub, consistent with the expected launch timing we shared on our Q3 FY2022 call. A prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection device, PosiFlush SafeScrub, is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. It's a good example of how we're driving continuous innovation that extends our leadership in our durable core and within the broader $9 billion vascular access management market. Another milestone in our vascular access portfolio was clearance of our new PowerMe midline catheter by the Chinese regulatory agency NMPA. This was designed by our R&D center in China for China and is our first midline in this geography and offers up to 30 days of continuous venous access while reducing patient complications. We're excited about the opportunity PowerMe creates to help develop and category for vascular access in China, and we look forward to the expected launch later this quarter. Our BD Life Sciences segment provides solutions from sample collection and discovery to diagnosis and serves dynamic end markets like single cell analysis, clinical microbiology, point-of-care and the molecular diagnostics market, where we continue to advance our strategy of menu expansion with initial sales outside the U.S. of our BD MAX respiratory viral panel or RVP. This multiplex respiratory panel detects COVID-19, flu A and B and RSV in a single test and is an ideal solution for endemic respiratory testing. This aligns to our strategy to accelerate our growth in the $4 billion molecular diagnostics end market that's growing about 9%. The RVP panel is currently under FDA EUA review for U.S. launch. We also continue to progress our strategy in blood collection at the point-of-care. Point-of-care is one of the fastest-growing categories in diagnostics today that we believe will accelerate as diagnostic testing migrates to new and more convenient care settings such as retail clinics and pharmacies and even the potential of at home. Our BD MiniDraw capillary blood collection system is a disruptive innovation that enables collection of a high-quality blood sample without a venipuncture and is designed to provide a better patient experience across a broad range of care settings. We remain on track for 510(k) submission by the second half of FY2023. Our BD Interventional segment, which provides solutions for chronic disease management, serves end markets that dramatically improve people's lives, such as oncology, incontinence, advanced repair and reconstruction and the $5 billion peripheral vascular disease market, a space that's growing about 6%. Within PVD, we continued our strategy to globalize the BDI portfolio with the recent launch of our Venovo venous stent in China. The first stent in this market, specifically designed for iliofemoral venous disease. Within the $3 billion oncology end market, the space also growing about 6%, we achieved a significant milestone, completing safety testing for a multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy system, and we're on track for FDA submission and launch in FY2024. The BD multimodality VAB device is expected to be the first vacuum-assisted biopsy system designed to work across all three imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI, allowing customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training. These launches and milestones are good examples of how we're strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio. Our purposeful strategic investments in R&D as well as tuck-in M&A and CapEx are supported by our strong flexible balance sheet and disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. This framework also gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. In Q1, we also continued to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio and most recently, our operating model. More specifically, we continue to make progress on our RECODE portfolio simplification program, where we are reducing SKUs of older generation products in order to focus on the most important products needed to deliver care today. We remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in more cost-effective locations. All of these efforts are designed to reduce complexity, drive supply chain excellence, and make BD more agile while supporting the achievement of our margin expansion goals. Our BD2025 strategy is balanced, robust and resilient. And our foresight planning and agility are enabling us to deliver strong performance despite the continued macro environment, challenging all companies. To share some perspective specific to health care, overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in line with our view that challenges are going to persist, not escalate at least through 2023. While inflation is easing in some areas, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically and have planned for another year of outsized inflation primarily in labor and raw materials. We see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles primarily in our manufacturing organization. Across raw materials, some categories of resins used in finished goods are beginning to show signs of improvement while other materials such as packaging and rubber are still inflated versus historic prices. In terms of the COVID pandemic, broadly speaking, we see stabilization. While there continues to be surges in certain pockets around the world, similar to our customers, we have become more accustomed to managing through COVID-driven dynamics and have been effective at avoiding any extended manufacturing and distribution disruptions. Specific to China, we anticipate that the recent COVID restrictions that impacted us in Q1 will affect our peers as well. Our local teams are navigating these restrictions well, which reflects the resiliency and strength of our China organization and the diversity and durability of our business. By successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to continue delivering strong performance. Before I turn it over to Chris, I'll share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. In December, we published our second annual ID&E report, which provides details about our progress towards our 2030 ESG goals for promoting a healthy workforce and communities. The report highlights our improvements towards increasing diversity at the management and executive levels and spotlights our global associates who are advancing our culture and driving meaningful change within BD and the communities that we serve. We also published our third annual cybersecurity report. BD was the first in med tech to outline our ongoing efforts to advance cybersecurity in a report, including our work to protect against cyber-attacks and empower customers with information about cyber risks and vulnerabilities. We're proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts, most recently being named for the fourth consecutive year to both Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies, ranking in the top 25%, and the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, recognizing our ongoing commitment to workplace equality. In summary, I'm proud of our progress and momentum. Our associates are bringing our BD2025 strategy to life as we operate as a more agile, innovative med tech leader. BD is well positioned to drive profitable growth and create long-term value. First, our growth profile is consistent and durable. Second, we are enhancing our leadership positions through purposeful portfolio shifts into higher-growth markets, increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio. Third, we are improving our margin profile through our differentiated growth, enhanced simplification programs and ongoing supply chain excellence. And fourth, we are committed to remaining disciplined and maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. We see an increasing capacity through our BD2025 time frame to support value creation and continued strong growth through tuck-in M&A. All of this adds up to a compelling financial profile with a long-term targeted base revenue growth of 5.5% plus and double-digit EPS growth. Our updated guidance for FY 2023 reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve these targets. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Thanks, Chris. The future has never been brighter for BD. We have demonstrated a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution and have the talent, vision and momentum to continue delivering robust performance.  As we move through the back half of the fiscal year, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of our strategy. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.  With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue? Good morning Vijay. And thanks for the great question. I'll turn that over to Chris. Vijay, on the other two questions that you asked, on China specifically, so China declined slightly in the quarter, obviously due to the COVID impact. We did see at the end of this month \u2013 last month, January, starting to see some recovery there. So, we're optimistic for the year, we still \u2013 as you know, we delivered double-digit growth in China. Last year, we said high singles or near double or about that this year, and that's unchanged. We think we will be able to recover in the back portion of this year. We still have our four-pronged strategy that we have in China we remain very confident in. We've got a very strong team there that's been navigating that challenging environment. Again, they delivered 10% plus growth in 2022, and we expect another strong 2023. And that strategy that focuses on bringing our global pipeline to China continuing to drive China tailored R&D. And you heard us talk about a new launch there in the midline of a product developed in China for China. We continue to move in to expand our market coverage into lower-tier settings, continue to manage through the BOBP where it exists, that's in our run rate. And we continue to strengthen our local presence in China, both our manufacturing presence as well as clinical expertise as we continue to train thousands and thousands of clinicians each year. That formula has worked very well for us in the past, and we continue to double down on that. I think as we think about the combo test, I'll turn that over to Dave to speak a little bit about what we're seeing there. We appreciate that, Matt. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. Good morning, Larry. Larry, you're right. We're at or actually a bit ahead of the deal model there. We couldn't be more pleased with Parata. And we've got Mike here in the room. So let me turn it over to Mike to talk about what the other acquisition is that's in those numbers and a bit more about Parata. I think we \u2013 fair to say, Larry, we don't see any change in the trajectory around the macro factors that are driving demand for that, right? The labor shortages, the need to repurpose pharmacists to do more things in the retail setting, like wellness checks and vaccines and address patients, all of that, right, drives the demand for automation and robotics. And it's really a great example of our smart connected care strategy, one of the three transformational areas that we're focused on. It's a great example of us bringing that to life. So really good momentum in the Medical segment there. Good morning, Robbie. Yes. Good question, Robbie. So I'll start with the COVID and Dave can add in here. But I would say a few things. One is, so our COVID testing as you know is primarily in professional settings. And when we talk about our \u2013 and molecular, to a degree as well, too, we don't have a strong presence in At Home. We do have an At Home test, but it's not it's a \u2013 it's not nearly as big of a presence as in our professional setting. So I think perhaps where you see the most outsized performance there is in company \u2013 is from companies with a large At Home presence where you've just seen a lot of the COVID testing migrate to At Home versus in professional settings since it's so easy to do and people can do that without going into a clinician. So I think that's one factor probably influencing some of the delta for us. As you know, we do have a combo test in development for At Home, and we'll share once we get that, hopefully that EUA and able to launch that. Dave, any other comments to add there on COVID? I think the good thing, Robbie that we would look at as is that we're really getting more to a durable revenue number in that, right? So I think as we look at 2023, it's a number that could be very much in line with how we think about it playing out in future years as well at that level where there's not still significantly high numbers that would drop in the future that were really at a kind of a durable level of performance in those categories. Chris, any other? Typically, yes. Just to add we typically wouldn't raise unless it was a highly unusual situation, trying to predict expectations on a full year basis on flu or a flu combo test just because it can drop off so quickly. And in fact, we are seeing, right, that's happening if you look at the CDC charts, those charts are showing significant drop-off like what happened in Australia. Rapid early peak and then a rapid drop, unclear if there could be second or third peaks in the future, but that's not something we can easily predict. So typically in Q1, we try to be conservative around that \u2013 those outlooks in that specific product category. More after Q2, we get a sense of where the full year plays out. Thanks. I think just to add in there, we had seen even versus the first half of January to the back half of January, we started seeing good recovery towards the back half of January as the COVID outbreak began to subside. Thanks Dave. Thanks Matt. Good morning, Rick. Great questions, Rick. Thank you. So on the innovation side; obviously, we appreciate the comments there. We're really pleased with the momentum that we have. And as I've said many times, we think we have the most exciting pipeline in the company's history. If you look at last year in FY 2022, we had 25 new product launches, things like our HealthSight diversion management moving into the operating room or the new Pyxis ES platform or a series of new dyes and the first of their kind in BDB or our core high-throughput platform.

We highlighted PureWick in the past, PosiFlush in MDS, list goes on again in JPMorgan went through those pretty deeply, and I highlighted a few here on the call today.  I think as we think about tuck-in M&A, we're going to remain extremely disciplined. I've shared in the past, of course, many times, we're still focused on tuck-in M&A exclusively. We're very focused on maintaining that strong balance sheet that we have, and we are going to continue to increase the amount of cash that we generate, and we feel really good about how that looks over the next several years.  We have our very focused priorities. We don't disclose specific market categories that we're focused on there. But we've obviously pointed very specifically to three areas of focus around smart connected care, around technologies that enable the shift to new care settings and around technologies that help us improve chronic disease outcomes in the chronic disease spaces that we're focused in, like oncology, peripheral vascular disease, et cetera. And so, over the last three years, 90% plus of the M&A dollars that we've spent have been focused in those three categories, and we would certainly expect that continue going forward, that level of focus. Thanks for the question. I just want to thank everyone for your time today. Great series of questions. Obviously, we're \u2013 we feel really good about the performance as we started this year, and we look forward to providing updates in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Hey Vijay, good to hear you. Thanks for the question. Yes, so just on COVID and combo, as I think about both of those. I mean, as you saw in the quarter, we posted COVID-only revenues of $32 million. And as we said on the call, we now expect COVID only for the full year to be between $50 million and $100 million. I think Chris commented right, we are seeing obviously stabilization in the market. We are seeing a decline in testing for COVID only. Actually, as that testing shifts to these combination tests, and actually, for us, in Q1, our performance in that area did actually help offset that COVID-only decline. We had anticipated that that's the way that was going to become the standard of care. I'm actually very proud of the team in terms of the way they sort of anticipated and reacted and built these combination test supplies to support the Q1 performance. And I think if you think about the installed base that we've grown on BD MAX, the fact that we've released these combination assays on both BD MAX, BD Veritor, BD COR actually now in Europe is CE-marked. I think that dynamic, and we can talk about it later, the dynamic of what that looks like for the full year on the respiratory testing obviously continues to play out. But yes, COVID only, we definitely see a decline. Yes. So for the year, we think COVID only now will be in the range of $50 million to $100 million. So, yes. So, we never really \u2013 so, if I think about that, the way \u2013 if you think about what we said from a, let's say, a flu season pre-pandemic, we had said that was always in the $75 million to about $100 million range on the antigen testing and so on and so forth. There is obviously a lot of unknowns right now in terms of how the full year is going to play out. Obviously, quarter one, we saw the season start early, if you track those CDC graphs, we saw the season start early, it peaked, and we were able to respond to that. If we were looking at it now and for all the assumptions we have, we would think it will be about 1.5 times, let's say, a normal season. So $75 million to $100 million, we would say 1.5 times. And that's really enabled and driven by the installed base increases that we have and the fact that we have developed to launch these combination sets across those platforms. Yes. Hey Robbie. I mean I think, Tom, you captured well. I think when we did our At Home COVID test; we made a very deliberate decision to pursue a digital strategy. You saw the acquisition that we made of Scanwell. We were very much aligned to the test, treat and trace reporting dynamics. And we intentionally sort of targeted that digital ecosystem with a higher price, higher margin rather than the visually red at-home test. We still think on a go-forward basis, as the sort of, let's say, the sort of the government contracts and things abate, as testing perhaps becomes more regulated At Home, 510(k) environments and so on, a digital ecosystem, again plays into the smart connected care of BD will be important. But I think for us, we just look at it all as we're seeing the softening in the COVID decline. We firmly believe that the standard of care going forward will be these \u2013 in an endemic type of approach, these combination tests and we've built a portfolio across BD MAX, BD COR, Veritor and potentially Veritor At-Home across all of these combination portfolios. Yes. And I think the only other things that I would talk about, Matt. Just in terms of the market dynamics, we track things like bed occupancy and so on really closely. And if you look at a lot of the data sort of in our first quarter and sort of beds that were occupied by COVID-only patients was like maximum peak of like 6%, which is way down from sort of north of 22% in sort of prior period. So that COVID-only dynamics is definitely softening.  And I mean I'll just reinforce what I said earlier on around these combination assays where the unmet need is if somebody presented symptomatically and you want to know, particularly in the respiratory season, do I have COVID, do I have flu, do I have RSV, we think that is going to be the norm on a go-forward basis. And I think we talked earlier on that we have those on MAX outside the U.S., on Veritor.  Two things I would also highlight that is for the combination assay here in the U.S., we are under EUA review with the FDA right now. And actually, just late \u2013 or BD MAX, yes. And late last month, we actually did file our EUA for an at-home combination assay. So there are also two EUAs that are under review right now. Who \u2013 as I said, right now, the season is extremely quiet. But this is also about us planning and preparing for whatever the respiratory season may be towards the end of this calendar year."

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile in our BD2025 strategy, playing out as planned. So first, beginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, delivering $4.6 billion in revenue with base business growth of 5.2% or 3% organic. We see underlying organic growth more at mid-single-digits when adjusting for strategic product exits, the licensing fee comparison in life sciences, and several COVID-driven comparisons. COVID-only testing revenues were $32 million, which is expected, declined from $185 million last year. Total company base business growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with approximately 6% growth. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 3.3% reflects the comparison to licensing revenues that impacted growth by almost 400 basis points. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Revenues in China declined slightly, which reflects the impact of COVID restrictions, offset by strong performance from new product introductions in BDI and research solutions in BDB. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver near double-digit growth in China. Our base business revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio, and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions in our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter. Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 6.1%. BD Medical performance reflects strong growth in both Medication Management Solutions and Pharm Systems, which more than offset a decline in Medication Delivery Solutions. The decline in MDS of 1% was driven by COVID-related comparisons and the impact of recent COVID restrictions in China as well as planned strategic portfolio exits. We continue to see strong performance in Vascular Access Management outside the U.S. Double-digit growth of 15.5% in MMS was driven by strong demand for our pharmacy automation solutions, including both Parata and Rowa. We've been very pleased with customer response and the performance of Parata. As expected, growth in MMS also reflects the comparison to higher dispensing installations and infusion set utilization in the prior year driven by COVID dynamics. We continue to have a very healthy backlog of customer orders for Pyxis and BD HealthSight, which reflects the strength of our connected medication management portfolio. And despite strong growth of 18% in Q1 of last year, Pharm Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by continued penetration in the high-growth biologic and vaccine markets. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. The decline of 7.3% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues. Life Sciences base revenues grew over 7%, excluding the licensing grow over as previously discussed. Growth was driven by growth in Integrated Diagnostic Solutions base revenue of 1.3%, or 6.4% when excluding the licensing comparison. This strong underlying mid-single-digit growth was driven by BD Kiestra that is helping to address laboratory labor shortages through automation and informatics and continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD Max installed base. In addition, there was strong demand for our respiratory testing portfolio that was partly aided by the timing of orders. High single-digit growth of 9.2% in Biosciences reflects continued growth from new product launches combined with strong double-digit growth in research reagents, enabled by our differentiated content and dye strategy. We continue to see demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry analyzers and sorters as researchers continue to do even higher parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 5.6%. Growth was driven by surgery growth of 3.1%, which reflects strong performance in advanced repair and reconstruction driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix, Hernia, resorbable scaffold and double-digit growth in biosurgery, aided by the Tissuemed acquisition. Growth in surgery was tempered by planned strategic portfolio exits and then expected decline in BD ChloraPrep due to a tough comparison to the prior year as a result of dealer stocking. Peripheral Intervention grew 10.8%, which reflects double-digit growth in PVD, driven by the Venovo relaunch, coupled with continued global penetration of Rotarex, and the acquisition of Venclose, which addresses chronic venous insufficiency. Additionally, growth was strong in oncology, within Greater Asia due to an improved backlog situation associated with prior year supplier constraints. Urology growth of 1.8% reflects double-digit growth in our PureWick, chronic, incontinence solutions and endourology that benefited from reduced back order due to improved supplier performance. Offsetting this strong performance was a difficult comparison in urological drainage due to shore step back order release and distributor stocking in the prior year. Now moving to our P&L. We reported Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.98, which included gross margin of 54.7% and operating margin of 22.9% that were consistent with our expectations. While we are no longer providing a specific breakout of the impact to margins from COVID-only testing, you will recall the comparison to higher testing in the prior year is weighted to the first half and as expected is the driver of the decline in reported Q1 margins year-over-year. Excluding the COVID impacts to margins in Q1 of both years, both gross and operating margins in our base business were up slightly year-over-year. The improvement in base margins was delivered despite around 350 basis points of outsized inflation that as expected was primarily driven by selling through inventory that included peak inflation impacts from FY 2022, such as increases in certain raw materials noted earlier as well as the impact of labor inflation and elevated shipping. We were able to offset a large portion of this impact to our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and the benefit from strategic portfolio access of lower-margin products as planned. We expect the impact from inflation to moderate as we move through the year. Base margin performance also includes growing over the impact from licensing revenues in the prior year. As expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flow through sales. R&D of 6.4% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Q1 reflects timing of project spend. We expect R&D to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-range target of 6%. Our tax rate in Q1 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that were planned for during the year. Regarding our cash and capital allocation; cash flows from operations totaled approximately $400 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow reflects an impact of approximately $300 million from higher inventory balances. The increase reflects the impact of inflation and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand. We've seen good progress in December and January on WIP [ph] and finished goods rightsizing with January inventory dollars down sequentially from December. We are working to moderate strategic raw material purchases as stability improves in select markets. However, we continue to make prudent trade-offs where necessary to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results. Assuming continued stabilization of the macro environment and supply chain, we expect to continue to manage inventory levels down and by the end of the fiscal year had this be a positive source of cash and meaningful progress towards meeting our long-term cash conversion goals. We paid down approximately $500 million in long-term debt in Q1 and ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $600 million and a net leverage ratio of 3 times. As the year progresses and we build cash, we can increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A. Moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our first quarter performance, we are confident in increasing our revenue and EPS guidance, given the strength of our base revenue growth, consistent execution of our margin goals, and reflecting the latest FX rates. Starting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well positioned for strong growth across our three segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations despite the impact of restrictions in China, and thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75%. This is an increase of 50 basis points from our prior guidance of 5.25% to 6.25% and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our consistent durable growth profile. Our base revenue guidance continues to include planned strategic portfolio exits that will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter most to our customers. We initiated these actions in Q1 and for the full year, continue to expect the impact to base revenue growth of approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin. Offsetting this revenue impact, we continue to expect a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions with Parata being the predominant driver. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata; Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comps and Interventional to be above the midpoint.  For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million to $100 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $125 million to $175 million and is driven by reduced testing volumes and the continued shift in the market to combination testing for respiratory illness. Regarding Alaris, we continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in line with fiscal 2022 demand.  Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points while absorbing the decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to mitigate inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving operating margin levels of about 25% in fiscal year 2025.  We continue to expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A [ph], driven by internal cost containment and leverage. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales.  Below operating income, our assumptions regarding interest, other and tax remain unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 350 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing, which is about 50 basis points more than we previously anticipated. As a result, this implies a very strong low-teens base earnings growth of approximately 12.5% to 14.5% compared to 12% to 14% previously anticipated.  Let me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in November, the U.S. dollar weakened against all of our major currencies. Based on current spot rates, which assumes the euro at $1.08 for the remainder of the year. For illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points, or about $370 million to total company revenues on a full year basis, which is an improvement of approximately 250 basis points compared to our prior view.  The currency headwind to adjusted EPS growth has also declined significantly since our November earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 230 basis points to adjusted EPS growth compared to approximately 420 basis points previously.  All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $500 million to a range of $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion compared to $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion previously and are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.07 and $12.32, which is an increase of $0.22 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance range of $11.85 to $12.10.  As we think of fiscal 2023 phasing, there are various items to consider. We have outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note. First, regarding margins. We expect Q2 operating margin to be similar to our FY 2022 full year margin. This demonstrates our strong focus on profitable growth given the continued impact of inflation and the grow-over impact of our COVID-only testing revenue, both of which we expect to be most prominent in the first half of the year. As a reminder, COVID-only testing has a higher margin and reinvestment of COVID-only testing profit was weighted to the back half of the year. As the year progresses and we continue to benefit from our simplification and inflation mitigation programs, we anticipate margin expansion to be most prominent and to increase through the second half. Second, regarding FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue and EPS will be over-indexed to the first half with about 90% of the full year impact to revenue and about 80% of the full year impact to EPS occurring in the first half. For the full year, we expect the FX drop-through to earnings to be in line with our BDX operating margin.  Lastly, a couple of timing items to note. We expect R&D as a percentage of sales to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-term target of 6%. Additionally, the midpoint of our full year effective tax rate guidance indicates an effective tax rate over 16% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly throughout the year as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict.  In closing, we are very pleased with our performance, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile and our BD 2025 strategy continuing to progress as planned. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY 2023 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business.  With that, let me turn it back to Tom for few additional comments. Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Maybe a couple of macro comments. One, I just think this represents another quarter of strong execution, consistent with what we shared overall. When you think of our kind of forward-looking view from our updated guidance, I think, a few key things, not that we highlighted and then I'll address your question maybe with where we see some pockets of strength. But one, we did increase to your point, 50 basis points of growth on our base business. That strength is pretty broad-based when you think of it. I'll come back to that. And that's despite the fact that you had the restrictions and impacts in China as well. So we more than absorbed that. We also absorbed the COVID-only testing revenue, which given the testing dynamics in the marketplace are not surprisingly down when you think of COVID only relative to our position in the market. That's a higher-margin offering, and we absorbed that as well. I think importantly, we continue to execute against our margin, and we committed to our \u2013 at least 100 basis points of margin improvement and then we incorporated FX. Yes, and to your point, when we're entering the year, I mean, one, Q1 is still under-indexed relative to our full year guide. Right? So that still holds together. We know there was about 100 basis points of headwind associated with the licensing revenue impact in our Life Sciences business that you saw in our results. We had estimated there is maybe about another 100 basis points of other dynamics, comp-related issues, mostly attributed to COVID. We also had some difficult comps in the quarter in certain areas like pharma systems, for example, grew 18%, Q1 last year, and we still delivered north of 10% growth in this quarter. So, I think that continues to be a source of strength for us. I think the flu season, there is probably a timing dynamic there. It peaked a bit earlier than we thought and was a higher spike. As we go through this call, Dave can certainly amplify that, but it's played out like it's played out in other areas with a quick season that's going to abate. So I think you have a timing dynamic there as well. So there is various items such as that. But largely speaking, I think, things are very consistent. We feel really good about the first quarter of the year, and it gave us confidence to increase our guidance. Yes, real quick on gross margin, we didn't give specific guidance on gross margin, we more \u2013 just to give you kind of an anchor how to expect Q2 to play out. We said it would be in line roughly with how we ended our full year fiscal year 2022, which when you think of the inflationary environment we're in, in the first half of the year, right, we talked about peak inflation rolling through in Q1 and Q2. We had a 350 basis point impact of inflationary pressure in Q1. And so, a Q2 margin similar to how we exited the year is what we're thinking. We did not specifically highlight gross margin. Yes. No problem. Thanks, Matt. I appreciate the question. Yes, things are pretty consistent with what we shared when we started the year, and it seems to be playing out as such. Some of the key factors to contemplate. First of all, we talked about that from a full year standpoint, inflationary headwinds being another 200-plus basis points. This is on the back of two other years with last year also being over 200 basis points. So, we've been navigating an extremely challenging macro environment, right, when you think of that on a cumulative basis. What we did say around the inflationary pressures, it would be significantly weighted towards the first half of the year will be highlighted in Q1 that you saw flow through because a lot of this was inventory that was built last year that sold through. 350 basis points of outsized inflation. That's on top of, I think, of normal inflation merit increases that everyone takes that would happen in any kind of environment, more of those 3% level. So, you're really talking about, call it, 400 basis points plus of costs that you have to contend with within your P&L. So then when you think of the mitigation offset to that, so -- by the way, so when you think of our Q1 performance and margin on the back of a 350 basis point inflationary pressure in the quarter, we're very pleased with how we started the year, because we knew the front half was going to be kind of the more challenging times. As we progress through the back half, there's a few things that will play out. One, it starts with our internal focus on cost improvement initiatives, simplify, whether it be Project RECODE, driving outsized cost improvement through our plants and other facilities. We're very focused on portfolio, whether it be driving mix. We took this bold strategic action around portfolio product exits that contributed within the quarter. And so, you don't do this was one thing. The strong growth rate, of course, gives you natural leverage. And then as we go through the back half of the year, while we'll still be in an elevated inflationary environment, the cost of materials will subside. You're seeing some of that subside in certain pockets of raw materials as an example, while other areas, like labor is continuing to persist. But you should see it trend down from that 350 basis points to get to our average of over 200 basis points that we talked about. So then when you think of kind of the dynamics within the P&L between GP and operating margin and where it will play out, GP, we said would be largely in line to just a slight improvement for the full year. And again, that goes back to the fact that we're absorbing the significant inflationary pressures. So, you're doing a lot of work to kind of stay flat to slightly above. And then the majority of it will end up showing up in operating margin as you think of leveraging your cost base there, some cost improvement actions we're also taking in OpEx, and we also continue to normalize our R&D spend in the second half. If you saw in Q1, and we expected in Q2 to have more outsized R&D above 6%, so the back half will be below 6% to normalize to our 6% rate. So, I think those are the biggest puts and takes as you think of the year, but we're very pleased again with Q1, how we started and how focused we've been on the margin profile. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Larry. There's a few things that obviously, I would call naturally. Well, kind of like, for example, we had reinvestment of the higher COVID-only margin from the first half and reinvestment was in the back half. That will stop. We talked about timing differences of the R&D spend. I mean, you got a 50 basis point swing just timing there from first half to second half as an example. I had also indicated on the call some of the SSG&A [ph] that we had incurred in Q1, there's timing elements there. So there's timing elements in probably R&D, SSG&A. You have the lack of reinvestment that you just stopped at. Those were onetime in nature. The other dynamic that you have in GP that I mentioned is the trend of some abatement while still elevated, but it's all on a relative basis of the raw material cost in the second half in GP. Short of something significant changing, we have pretty strong line of sight to those dynamics. And then from there, it's really just continuing the rhythm of our cost improvement initiatives. So, I think to your point, obviously, the macro environment has been fluctuating. So, we keep monitoring that. But I think given where we are, we feel pretty confident and we're certainly well on track to deliver the, at least 100 basis points of improvement for the year. Well, just the way you started your question, Robbie. So if you think of us absorbing the COVID-only and increasing our base revenue guidance by the 50 basis points, it wasn't like a swap out into combination testing. It was actually broadly based across the business. As Dave mentioned earlier, we still see the combo part of our portfolio at that 1.5 times, and we'll continue to watch how it plays out. There was a little bit of strength there, but it wasn't outsized relative to the other areas we also had stressed. Yes. I think that \u2013 I mean, there's other puts and takes within there. But generally speaking, yes, that's how we see the year playing out. Yes. I think just real quick on China. Thanks, Matt, for the questions. So I mean, last year is just an interesting proxy, right? We went through restrictions in our fiscal Q3. Despite that, we navigated. We had an impact in the quarter. We actually still grew in that quarter last year and posted around double-digit growth in fiscal year 2022. This quarter, we saw a modest decline, 1%, and in China specifically, and normally if you think of it as a double-digit growth business. With that said, Q1 last year, was a strong comp for us in China. We had a very strong quarter for various dynamics, including some new products that were introduced, et cetera. So we would say the impact is probably just south of 50 basis points, if you want to think about it, plus or minus in the quarter headwind just to give you some direction. We did highlight we still feel great, as Tom mentioned earlier, with the core strategy with that business, short of like further disruptions occurring this year and these being a more kind of acute. We should see again around double-digit growth for the year is what we had shared. So we did see some trends, recent trends, like we're watching it. So we're watching it closely, but it looks like you're starting to kind of see some turnaround in that market. It's still early. So we'll look at it and we'll update, of course, in Q2. But I think longer term, our strategy and performance in China is really strong. Yes. I think, COVID, I can let Dave and Tom jump in here too, kind of half accurate, I think, in your depiction. There's significant market dynamics on call it, COVID-only testing in the marketplace this year. If you think of last year, there was a lot of government intervention and school requirements and businesses. I mean there's \u2013 a lot of that has subsided. So there's a portion of the reduced testing that's just market dynamics playing out in terms of total volume, and that's not just shifting the combination testing.  With that said, we still feel good about our combo assay in having that because we do see that as the assay of choice as folks have are symptomatic going in and want to get tested for flu. So we saw strength in our platform. But as Dave articulated, the flu season did kind of spike early. So we'll have to kind of continue to watch that as we navigate through Q2. So it certainly wasn't a one-for-one shift by any means, not even really close to that."

Following this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents, Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Mike Feld, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation. With that, I am very to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Mike Feld, President of our Life Science segment, who joined BD in August from Veralto. Mike is known for building innovative, high-performing teams and his leadership principles are well aligned with BD's culture. Mike also brings deep experience in Shingijutsu Kaizen which is the heartbeat behind BD Excellence. There is no individual more suited to lead the Life Sciences team as they continue to expand the value BD brings to our customers and I look forward to Mike's partnership as we deliver on our strategy. Earlier today, we reported strong Q4 results with 7.4% revenue growth or 6.2% organic, 120 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS up 11.4%. For the full year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 5%. Despite fiscal '24 revenue growth that was below our initial expectations, we are pleased with how we navigated complex market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. Breaking things down, our MedTech and Diagnostics businesses grew a strong 5.9% this year, inclusive of absorbing a decrease in China, while our Bioscience-Pharma businesses grew about 1%, roughly in line with the end markets. Over the long term, we see Bioscience-Pharma as a durable, higher growth contributors to our portfolio and we remain confident in gradual market recovery, our competitive position and the team's execution. We consistently executed on margin expansion in FY '24, increasing adjusted EPS guidance each quarter and delivering full-year EPS of $13.14, adjusted operating margin of 24.2% and free cash flow of $3.1 billion, all ahead of our original plan and positioning us well moving into FY '25. I'd like to thank our global team of associates whose passionate commitment and focused execution of our strategy is making meaningful impact for the customers and patients we serve. Reflecting more broadly on our strategic direction and progress this past year, we made important advancements on each of our top 3 priorities. which are: one, drive sustained topline growth through high-impact innovation and commercial excellence; two, execute on BD Excellence to drive operational performance; and three, effectively deploy capital. First, on growth. We advanced multiple new growth platforms that put BD in the middle of the most significant trends reshaping health care, including the use of AI and automation in connected care to transform efficiency and outcomes, the shift to new care settings and the application of medical technology to improve treatment of chronic disease. Starting with our BD Medical segment. New biologic drugs promise to have the most significant impact on chronic disease in the history of modern medicine. In FY '24, we passed $1 billion of annual revenue in biologic drug delivery sales, driven by our leading prefillable devices and increased manufacturing capacity to serve growing GLP-1 demand. As the leader in biologics drug delivery and with a growing pipeline of targeted innovations such as our Libertas and Evolve wearable devices, we believe no company is better positioned than BD to capitalize on a significant growth opportunity. We continue to advance our platform for pharmacy robotics which now ranks as one of the largest robotics businesses in med tech and is enabling the transformation of retail, online and hospital pharmacies with significant opportunity for future growth. We're also extremely pleased with the first year of the Alaris return to market and its role in our connected medication management strategy. We exited the year at our historical revenue run rate and continue to see strong customer preference for the Alaris Power of One. Our acquisition of advanced patient monitoring in FY '24 expands our connected care solutions in a high-growth market and enables future innovation opportunities in breakthrough closed-loop monitoring and treatment which BD is uniquely positioned to deliver across our platforms. Integration is going as expected and the commercial teams are fully engaged in maximizing the benefits of APM for our customers. In BD Interventional, we had a fantastic year advancing our PureWick urinary incontinence platform, launching our next-gen PureWick Flex and expanding PureWick Male into the home. In our advanced tissue regeneration portfolio, Phasix and GalaFLEX are additional examples of how our tuck-in M&A strategy is now driving strong organic growth. We continue to transform hernia surgery and are expanding this platform into new applications for plastic and reconstructive procedures, driven by trends in aging and GLP-1 weight loss which increasingly call for soft tissue support to restore function and improve appearance. Across BD Life Sciences, we continue to reinvent the field of flow cytometry with the launch of the 3 in 4 laser FACSDiscover S8 Sorter and multiple new reagents using unique AI algorithms to optimize dye designs that are enabling new scientific insights. In Diagnostics, our new high-throughput molecular platform, BD COR and Onclarity HPV assay, continued to gain traction with self-collection and new care settings for cervical cancer screening now available in many countries around the world, representing a meaningful new growth opportunity for BD. While these and other new BD innovations are playing a key role in transforming care, most every significant healthcare procedure uses a BD COR device whether robotic surgeries, valve transplant, new cancer treatment or advanced vascular procedures, BD syringes, catheters, pumps, surgical prep, blood collection and other products are there. In FY '24, we saw strong growth across our core devices, driven by share gains and procedural volumes. Turning to operational performance; we launched BD Excellence about 18 months ago. And it's been incredible to see the momentum behind simplifying our company, improving quality and accelerating margin progression. Through BD Excellence, our team has made strong progress on network optimization, increasing plant productivity and delivering double-digit improvements in waste and operating equipment efficiency or OEE. All of this drove margins, EPS and cash flow above plan. We have much more headroom going forward through BD Excellence and it positions us well to deliver on our goals for FY '25 and beyond. On our third priority of strong stewardship of value-creating capital deployment, our focus on cash generation enabled strong growth in free cash flow, increased free cash flow conversion and allowed us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Earlier this morning, we announced our 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases, extending our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. Meaningful return of capital to shareholders will remain a key priority in our capital allocation strategy going forward. Beyond those priorities, in FY '24, we expanded our position as a leader in corporate responsibility, with significant progress toward our 2030 corporate sustainability goals. We became one of a handful of med tech companies to have near- and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and net zero targets approved by the science-based target initiative. We surpassed both our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions targets. And as part of our ongoing health equity strategy, we advanced partnerships around the world in areas such as improving access to cervical and breast cancer screening. We are pleased to be recognized for our efforts, most recently being named a 3BL's list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and ranking in the top 2 in health care. Looking ahead to FY '25, we will continue to execute in alignment with each of those 3 priorities. We have more than 25 planned new product launches this year and calling out just a few. In BD Medical, we're launching our next-generation Pyxis platform which includes the cadence of hardware and software upgrades and releases which will begin to roll out by the end of calendar year '25 and continue for the next several years. This will be the first system to use BD's new advanced AI platform that will integrate data across BD smart devices. We have a number of new launches planned in our advanced patient monitoring business to revolutionize hemodynamic monitoring. The next-gen HemoSphere Alta Monitor will feature a full range of sensors enabled with predictive IQ algorithms that provide comprehensive pressure, flow and tissue oxygenation insights for varying acuities. New Swan IQ and ForeSight IQ smart sensors will provide new patient insights, including new-to-world right heart pressures and cerebral oxygenation. In BD Life Sciences, we plan to launch the first BD FACSDiscover Analyzer, the A8, to provide customers with high-throughput sample analysis with the same innovative technologies as our breakthrough Cell Sorter. And lastly, in BD Interventional, in our PureWick platform, we're advancing the pivotal study for at-home reimbursement and expect to continue the cadence of innovation with the launch of PureWick Portable, a solution that restores mobility to people's lives. We look forward to sharing a full portfolio update at our Investor Day on February 26 at the New York Stock Exchange. We believe we are well positioned heading into FY '25, with the strength of our portfolio enabling us to effectively navigate market dynamics and the momentum of BD Excellence driving margin expansion to deliver a strong earnings and cash profile. I'll now turn it to Chris to provide further color on our financials and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered competitive organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year even while navigating market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. And importantly, with strong execution of our BD Excellence programs, we exceeded our full-year margin, earnings and cash flow goals. I'll now provide some further insight into our Q4 revenue performance. BD Medical organic growth was led by MMS with another quarter of exceptional performance in infusion systems, driven by the BD Alaris return to market. Higher pull-through and utilization of infusion sets also contributed to MMS growth. The unit's performance was partially offset by a tough prior year comparison in dispensing. Our MDS consumable portfolio also contributed to the segment's Q4 growth. We continue to advance our position in the U.S. with broad volume growth and share gains, particularly in our hypodermic and vascular access management portfolios, where our quality and agility to meet increased demand has positively benefited healthcare delivery across our markets. Pharm systems performance reflects another quarter of double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologic drugs, primarily GLP-1s which was partially offset by market dynamics across the industry, including expected customer inventory destocking. Rounding out the BD Medical segment, in early September, we closed the acquisition of Edwards Critical Care, now Advanced Patient Monitoring or APM which contributed $74 million to BD Medical revenue. BD Life Sciences performance was led by IDS. Strong mid-single-digit growth in specimen management was driven by volume growth as investment in our U.S. direct sales team drove increased demand and customer upgrades to higher-value products to provide an enhanced patient experience. Within our Diagnostics business, our results reflect some tough prior-year comparisons in lab automation and ID/AST. Offsetting these impacts was good traction leveraging our molecular platform installed base with double-digit growth in both BD MAX and BD COR. BD Life Sciences growth was partially offset by transitory market dynamics in Biosciences that resulted in lower market demand for research instruments and reagents. Clinical Solutions grew double digits, led by our FACSLyric cell analyzer and cancer reagents. We continue to outperform our life science peers given our portfolio mix of leading instruments, including the BD FACSDiscover, antibodies, dyes and software. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in BDB as a number of new innovations are driving share gains. Strong organic growth in BD Interventional was led by double-digit growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise. PureWick Female grew double digits and PureWick Male delivered its strongest quarter since its launch in acute care. We are also very pleased with the male direct-to-consumer launch, where the first few months of revenues exceeded our expectations. Surgery delivered another quarter of above-market growth. Within advanced repair and reconstruction, continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold drove double-digit growth. It was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year in synthetic mesh. Performance in Surgery was also driven by double-digit growth in infection prevention due to increased demand for ChloraPrep related to strong procedural volumes. BDI performance was also supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease and high single-digit growth in end-stage kidney disease. PI growth was partially offset by a decrease in oncology due to prior year distributor inventory stocking in the U.S. Now, moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.81 reflects double-digit growth of 11.4%. Consistent with our commitments, we delivered strong margin progression in Q4 with adjusted gross margin up 30 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% and adjusted operating margin up 140 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points year-over-year to 26.6%. Margin expansion was driven by strong leverage on our revenue performance and simplification and efficiencies from BD Excellence. For the full year, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $13.14 which represents growth of 7.6%. Adjusted gross margin of 53.3% was in line with our expectations. As planned, strong execution of BD Excellence enabled us to absorb outsized inflation, transactional FX and about 50 basis points from inventory optimization carryover that supported strong fiscal year '24 cash flow. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 24.2%, exceeding our margin goal for the year, driven by shipping and SG&A leverage. While delivering strong margin performance, we also invested $1.1 billion in R&D to advance our pipeline of innovative programs that will support future growth. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, our strategic choices of strong execution on cash flow optimization drove a $1 billion or 47% increase in free cash flow to $3.1 billion and a larger-than-expected improvement in free cash flow conversion by 22 percentage points to 82%. Broad-based improvements in working capital, including our strategic choice to optimize inventory levels, continued expense management and our ability to leverage capital expenditures from BD Excellence productivity gains were all key factors driving strong execution this year. We also benefited from the timing of certain discrete cash items. Our strong cash position supported our acquisition of APM while also returning $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cash and short-term investments on September 30 totaled $2.2 billion, inclusive of about $900 million in proceeds from February's debt refinancing. After closing the Advanced Patient Monitoring acquisition, we ended the year with net leverage of 3x which was in line with our expectations. We believe we are well positioned to deleverage to our 2.5x target over the next 12 to 18 months. We remain focused on underlying cash flow improvements. Despite the timing impact of some discrete cash items, we expect next year's organic free cash flow conversion to be consistent with this year due to strong execution in working capital. As expected, due to integration-related investments for APM, we anticipate a moderate step back in free cash flow conversion to around 75%. However, we expect this will still result in another strong year of free cash flow dollars which will support investments in growth, debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders. Given the outperformance this year and our confidence in next year's plans, we believe we are in a strong position to execute our net leverage commitments and plan to deploy about $1 billion towards share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months, while still delivering on our deleveraging target of about 2.5x within this time frame. We see this as a value-creating opportunity based on our view of BD's intrinsic value. Moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25. Our initial fiscal year '25 guidance is anchored on high single-digit revenue growth driven by the contribution from APM and a broad-based competitive organic revenue growth profile that captures a prudent view of market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. We expect increasing momentum from BD Excellence to drive significant margin expansion which will enable delivery of strong adjusted EPS growth of about 10% at the midpoint. This growth includes increased acquisition-related interest expense and a higher tax rate inclusive of Pillar 2. We expect to deliver total revenues in the range of $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion in fiscal year '25 which reflects a modest foreign currency translation impact of 25 basis points and currency-neutral adjusted revenue growth of 8.8% to 9.3%. This includes strong performance from our newly acquired APM business, consistent with what we previously shared, plus organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. This includes absorbing about 125 basis points impact from China and Bioscience-Pharma with China expected to decrease by mid-single digits. Across the balance of our portfolio which represents about 75% of our total organic revenue, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth around our 5.5% plus growth profile. Moving to margins and earnings. We are confident in delivering another year of strong operational performance, particularly our ability to expand adjusted operating margin by about 100 basis points and exceed our 25% margin goal we set over 2 years ago. The primary driver of margin expansion in fiscal year '25 is expected to come from gross margin with an increasing benefit from accelerating BD Excellence momentum. Below gross margin, we expect some leverage primarily in shipping and G&A, offset by increasing investments in selling and R&D to further support our growth profile. We expect interest and other to be up year-over-year, primarily due to the debt issued in connection with the Advanced Patient Monitoring acquisition. For tax, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 14% and 15.5% which includes the impact of Pillar 2. As a reminder, it would not be unusual for our tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Given these considerations, we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $14.25 to $14.60, inclusive of a modest foreign currency translation headwind. As you think about fiscal 2025 phasing, we expect first half revenue growth to be modestly below the low end of our total revenue guidance and the second half to be modestly above the high end. This includes our expectation of a heavier impact to first half revenue growth from the expected decrease in China revenues, a larger impact from Bioscience-Pharma dynamics in Q1 and the comparison to prior year licensing revenue in Q2. As revenue dollars increase sequentially throughout the year, we expect the benefit from BD excellence and strong OpEx leverage to result in increasing adjusted gross and operating margins throughout the year. This results in strong year-over-year growth in OIBT each quarter. Based on a ratable tax rate, we expect first half and second half adjusted EPS growth rate to be ratable which implies about 10% growth at the midpoint of our full year guidance range and is a nicely balanced phasing profile. In closing, our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum. We expect to deliver competitive growth that appropriately plans for market dynamics in China and bioscience pharma. Accelerating momentum in BD Excellence is supporting strong margin expansion, enabling investment in R&D to support further growth. This coupled with strong cash generation and a disciplined approach to capital allocation is expected to drive continued value creation for all of our stakeholders. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe on this guidance question here. Thanks for all the details. The 125 basis points of headwinds on pharma, biosciences in China, it looks like you're assuming essentially those 3 segments are flattish for the year. I know China is down. But when you look at all 3, is that flattish? And the reason I ask is, it looks like those 3 segments together maybe grew slightly here in Q4. And when I look at this comparison versus some of your life science tools peers, they're all declining mid- to high singles given some of these dynamics. So I just want to understand that your trends in those 3 segments are coming in about peers but the guidance does feel like conservative. And related to that on phasing here, is Q1 going to be still in that 4% to 4.5% -- any impact on hurricane, IV fluids?\nTom Polen: Okay. Vijay, I appreciate the comments there. So I'll start off with just some comments on some of our assumptions for the year and then I'll turn it over to Chris to speak to the phasing. So stepping back more broadly as we think about the life science and bioscience space, as you said, we recognize for the full year, we obviously had to make an adjustment midyear that was below our initial guide to reflect the dynamics that are going on in that market. And while we had a very strong Q4, we also recognized that while it was within our range, it was the organic number was modestly below the Street expectation given those dynamics. What I think as we step back, we're really pleased with how our teams have navigated those spaces. If you just break out FY '24, we grew 5% overall as a company. That's 5.9% in our med tech diagnostics business and about 1% in that biopharma or biosciences-pharma space for the full year. If you look at Q4, we were 7.5% growth in the med tech diagnostics space, 1.3% in the bioscience-pharma space. So as you mentioned, Q4 was a little bit of an uptick in the bioscience-pharma versus the full year period. But both of those, obviously, very strong on the med tech diagnostic core businesses. And even at 1% for the full year or the 1.3% for the quarter, it was very competitive versus what you're seeing more broadly in the market in those spaces. And so we're pleased with our portfolio. We're pleased with how our teams are executing. And as we look forward, I think we've been -- let me start with maybe just a comment on China since you commented on that, too and how we've built that into our assumptions for FY '25. I think I've been consistent in taking a cautious view on China in the near term but also being very positive on the long term, given the large structural unmet healthcare needs and the opportunity for our local capabilities and portfolio to help serve those. And so in China, you're seeing value-based procurement dynamics pretty broad across the industry. We continue to see all throughout FY '24, we expect it to continue very strong volume growth in China but offset by the impact of VBP on price. Long term, we -- because we're holding a very strong position in the market, we think that's the right thing to do long term and we feel good about our long-term strategic position. But for FY '25, we built in mid-single-digit decline in China into our guide assumptions. That assumes continued very strong volume growth, continued holding our position very nicely there. But overall, that combination still resulting in a mid-single-digit decline that we've built into our guide. We think that's prudent. On the bioscience-pharma space, it's -- we've seen some uptick, as you mentioned, in Q4. I think it's still too early to forecast with high certainty what a recovery curve and timing looks like there. And so we're taking a prudent position on our guide and have that continuing at a rate similar to '24. Again, we really like our position in both the pharma space and in biosciences. We've got a lot of great innovation. We're extremely well positioned in the biologics. It's interesting, those 2 spaces that are going through transitory market dynamics. Of course, those 2 have been 2 of the fastest-growing businesses for BD over the last several years. And we expect they'll return to being 2 of the fastest-growing businesses in BD over the more mid- and long term. But we do think, given those dynamics that you mentioned, it's prudent for us to take a position that we've built into our guide. Just on the hurricane and then I'll turn it over to Chris on phasing. On the hurricane, we're not seeing any impact of that today. I'd say we're monitoring closely the -- any impacts that it could have on procedure volumes. I'm not seeing that broadly at this point. That's just something we're watching and we'll monitor as we see the recovery of that. There's some modest and small. We're focused on servicing our customers. People are using maybe larger volume syringes a bit more as replacement. There are some other products that could help substitute for those where there's gaps in IVs. But overall, we're focusing on servicing our customers during this period of time but we don't see a significant impact to the business. It's something we're monitoring.\nChris DelOrefice: Vijay, it's Chris. On the phasing, just so a couple of things. One, relative to where we were last year, like to Tom's point, we've taken a very prudent posture as it relates to the market dynamics that are real. We're not alone there, to your point. We have businesses competing there. As you think of our total phasing and balance across the year, it's actually pretty balanced certainly on earnings, first of all, I shared in the script, first half, second half, very balanced relative to the midpoint of the growth rate of our guide at about 10%. So you don't see a lot of fluctuation there. You're going to see a strong starting gross margin as you think of Q1 and a steady kind of normalized increase as we move through the year sequentially there. So I think as it relates to kind of P&L dynamics, very strong. On revenue, we did share that you're going to have a first half, second half dynamic where the growth rate will be below the low end of the total guide range for the first half. It will be above for the second half. One way to think of it, though, is maybe more look at the dollar phasing as a percent of dollars by quarter as we move through the year. We tend to have a lower first half versus second half. We're about 48%, 52% when you think of dollars as a percent of total, with Q1 being lower than the average of the 48%. You're going to see some nuances with the growth rate in Q1 that will be low. Remember, the market dynamics will be most prominent in Q1. And actually last year, both BDB and pharm systems, where we had these businesses, we're still at about mid-single digits if you go back and look at their performance. So you actually also have a comp in the quarter that's impacting us.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice quarter here. I wanted to just ask one question on Alaris, Tom. Did Alaris meet your goal of $350 million for fiscal '24? It sounds like Q4 was about $100 million or slightly below, I think, your expectation for $150 million in Q4. And how are you thinking about Alaris sales in fiscal '25 relative to fiscal '24?\nTom Polen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Larry. I'll start off and maybe turn it to Mike here in a moment. But we're really pleased with the first full year of Alaris launches. As we had shared midyear as we updated our outlook for Alaris. We expected Alaris to be back at the historical run rate within the first year of launch. And in fact, we saw that come through as expected. And so we feel good as we go into FY '25, also with having built a backlog of committed contracts which is something that we're also focused on rebuilding as we relaunched here this year. Maybe, Mike, any additional comments to that?\nMike Garrison: No, just we're really -- as you mentioned, we're really proud of the performance. I think from the standpoint, yes, we did exceed the $350 million. Larry, just to answer that question directly. In the medical number which was really positive for the quarter and MMS in particular, was really positive. There is a very difficult compared to last year with dispensing. We had a very, very strong year last year with dispensing, gained position, did a great job implementing and that continued through the year but just from a quarter-to-quarter comparison year-on-year, there's a little bit of an offset there. So Alaris actually did quite well in the quarter and we feel good. We feel good kind of feeling like next year, it's sort of business as usual. We're back to normal in terms of operating the business and continuing to serve customers. We feel good about the committed contract backlog that's been built throughout the year and the progression of how customers have moved through our sales funnel and our ability to ramp up service, ramp up manufacturing, things like that.\nTom Polen: Maybe just one last thing to add is we really did -- the team did a great job on the remediation efforts as well. We're very much on track. And then we do expect continued strong growth in Alaris as we go into FY '25. So thank you for the question, Larry.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I just wanted to push a little bit on the phasing for '25 and like especially Q1 kind of being kind of sub the guide for the full year, sub to 4% with Alaris so strong, you think you'd have a pretty easy Alaris comp. I don't know maybe there's some conservatism built in there. And then understanding like the comps get tougher throughout the year but it's another year of accelerating revenue guide. So just anything you can provide on confidence that you can still accelerate revenue growth over the course of the year against tougher comps?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Travis. It's Chris. I'll try and give a little extra color. I think consistent with what I've said, again, the BD profile in terms of how revenue ramps on an absolute dollar basis, it's actually pretty consistent with what you typically see. This is really all about, again, Q1, these market dynamics, you have 2 businesses that were growing mid-single digits last year. So you actually have a headwind in our comp. I know our growth rate looked low last year. But if you recall, we were cycling through moving respiratory into our base business and there was a big respiratory comp in Q1 which has no effect on this year as you think of growth rate. So really, you have a headwind when you think of year-over-year growth rates. And we feel good. So we're not reflecting substantial improvement in market dynamics as we move through the year. Q1 is the biggest. And then I would say we continue to see what I would call certainly well below our kind of normal growth rate on top line for those businesses that are market impacted. Like I said, more importantly, on earnings, we have a super balanced earnings per share growth profile with about right around the midpoint of our guide for first half, second half and you're going to see strong margins out of the gate with Q1 year-over-year margin improvement and then what I would call just a nice glide path of sequential margin improvement throughout the year.\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: I wanted to ask -- I realize you just gave a fiscal '25 guidance here. But as we kind of strip out the macro dynamics that you called out in the guide and I think a lot of us will just put Alaris as sort of onetime growth until you get back to the steady run rate probably sometime next year, how are you looking at the underlying growth of the business through '25 and into '26 and the sustainability there?\nTom Polen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. We feel really good about the -- how we've been moving BD into higher growth spaces. And you've seen that over the last several years, right? If you look at our underlying topline growth, we always look at it without COVID testing in there, it's been quite strong, right, north of 6% underlying growth for the company in our core business. And then obviously, we've got some transitory dynamics here that are affecting 2 of our strongest growing businesses over that period of time which are extremely well positioned in fast-growing spaces, right, biologic drug delivery and life science research on single cell or on cell analysis. So as we think about going forward, we continue to view the overall WAMGR of our spaces at about 5%. We don't change that for the short-term transitory dynamics that one sees happening in destocking in pharma or on the life science research side. And so we feel good about that. A number of the -- if you step back and I look at BD 2025 and how we've progressed there, we've got multiple growth platforms and levers now that -- many of which didn't exist at the start of BD 2025, whether or not that's our growth in biologics and GLP-1s which just crossed the $1 billion size this past year now, $1 billion of biologic drug delivery, the largest of any in the space and we're really well positioned there. The pharmacy automation to advanced patient monitoring now, a strong growth business. Our tissue reconstruction and infection prevention that you're seeing do really well in surgery, a PureWick platform which, as we've shared, we view as a $1 billion business opportunity by 2030, high throughput molecular on the diagnostics side. So we really like our position and the portfolio and the spaces that we're in. We're going to continue to reshape -- to continue to advance the portfolio in those spaces and capitalize on the opportunities that we've built. So thanks for the question, Robbie.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.\nPatrick Wood: Just given it's kind of topical at the moment, question around potential tariffs, supply chain impacts. Do you benefit from onshoring relative to any potential paths to go in? And how are you thinking about pricing as it interrelates within all of that?\nTom Polen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Patrick. From a tariff perspective, when we saw this dynamic that happened in the past, we were -- we didn't see significant impacts from that. Just as a reminder, from a China perspective, our strategy has always been strong local manufacturing in China for China. There's actually only really one product that we export from China today. And it's quite small in the grand scheme of BD. So as we go forward, that's something we'll certainly watch but our strategy is -- has been across the board and particularly given the volumes that we talk about when we're moving billions of units, right, our network is set up to serve local markets with heavy local manufacturing in many cases. We're a very strong domestic manufacturer in the U.S. Obviously, many things in Europe are served out of Europe, etcetera. But that's a space that we'll continue to obviously monitor that. But we do well navigating it the last time. Thanks for the question, Patrick.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Roman: I wanted to just to dig in a little bit more here on the P&L. And as we look at FY '25, there are some sort of discrete items here. You have a year-over-year kind of gross margin normalization as well as accretion from M&A, offset by tax headwinds and higher interest expense. And at the same time, as we look at Q4, we did see a churn in operating expense growth after kind of many quarters of year-over-year declines. So can you maybe just help us think about the construct of the P&L here both in FY '25 and how we should think about it beyond that point in terms of normalized growth drivers across the various line items?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. So we couldn't be more excited about kind of how we're shaping the P&L. The focus on BD excellence. You saw it in the back half of FY '24, all the progress we're making on gross margin. So we talked about year-over-year delivering about 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. However, this will be the first year that is predominantly coming from gross margin allows us to kind of reshape the P&L. We have differentiated levels that will enable growth as you think of selling specifically and R&D, so both shorter term and long term. And so we view this as a very healthy P&L. Obviously, if you go back to BD 2025 when we first rolled that out, at the time the market complexity and significant outsized inflation was not there. So we've been doing great things in gross margin but a lot of it has been covering those headwinds. Now you're seeing that play out. '25 is the first year that shows up, as we talk more in our upcoming Investor Day. That strategy will certainly continue and we see that as a key value driver on a go-forward basis. Thanks for the question, David.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Tom, I just wanted to circle back. You mentioned -- and congrats on the quarter and the kind of really well thought and thoughtful and put together guide. I thought on taking into account the market dynamics is super helpful. But for my question, I just wanted to drill down a little bit more into what you're doing in AI. You mentioned the first of a series of products or technologies or enabling systems that you're rolling out. And just anything you can flesh out on your strategy there and maybe how you're putting some of the data that you're generating at BD to work to kind of fuel those strategies.\nTom Polen: Yes. Thank you for the question, Matt. You're kind of teeing us up for our Investor Day on February 26, where we'll actually get to highlight and demo some of what we're doing there which we're really excited about. So if you just step back, BD has been focused in this space for quite a number of years. We have several products on the market today that utilize AI, whether or not that started with algorithms that we use for basically automating -- creating autonomous microbiology where there's software reading the petri dishes and determining is there growth or not and in some cases, what the bacteria is. And that's been built into [indiscernible] platform. We then partnered with Microsoft and utilize that technology to be looking at all the data across our platforms to determine where narcotic diversion could be happening in the healthcare system and identifying specific clinicians that are at risk describing why we believe that they are at risk and then helping hospital systems get them help and stop that from occurring. Of course, our new to BD business that we're really excited about, advanced patient monitoring has been doing a great job using AI building into their algorithms to help predict where there could be hemodynamic changes in the future. And we're really excited about how that can integrate in now with our infusion pump technology to help create closed loops in the future using AI combined with the devices that actually can impact patient care and be able to predict something is going to occur adjust therapy and help prevent it from ever occurring is really exciting concepts that we're working on. We did mention, as you said also on the call, the application of AI in a new platform that will be cutting across all BD devices. We'll be sharing more of that at our Investor Day on February 26 but its first launch will be taking place with our new Pyxis platform. And so think about new series of BD devices as we're launching them with Pyxis being the first of AI-enabled devices that will be able to connect into an AI cloud-based platform that will be able to take data from devices across our businesses and be able to use that to create better outcomes, create better efficiencies for clinicians and for staff that are analyzing that data. Again, we'll go much deeper on that hands-on at our Investor Day coming up in February but a little bit of a sneak preview. I'd say just one other maybe comment, Matt, is we are -- we certainly see significant opportunity on the innovation side, particularly given we have millions of smart devices out there, right? We have about 3 million smart devices out there generating data. And so right, the opportunity to use that data to do new things and create outcomes. So we think we're really uniquely positioned there. And we've been spending a lot of time thinking about that. Some of the increased R&D investment that Chris mentioned earlier is actually in this space as well. We're creating a new incubator focused on AI and our products. But more broadly, we're also applying it in operations. Of course, our large operational footprint, there's a real opportunity to use it from a forecasting perspective, optimizing line OEE and performance. And we have initiatives applying it there on the efficiency side as well. So, thanks again for the question.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor: I was wondering now that you've closed APM, if you could give us some additional thoughts on how you think that segment could grow over time and just how it's going to contribute to the margins going forward? And you were just talking about your connected strategy. So I was wondering if you had additional thoughts on how you could develop that and perhaps integrate it with some of the other segments there that are smart and connected and generating the data?\nTom Polen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. We couldn't be more excited about APMs coming into BD. We're really happy having Katie lead that team. I'd say the integration could be going better, really an immediate cultural fit and they're staying heads down executing. That's our focus is making sure that as we integrate, they can stay focused on servicing customers, driving the great innovation momentum that they've got and capitalizing on the opportunities ahead. As we think about -- we did highlight for the first time in our deck and in the discussion, just some of the products that they're launching this year that we're excited about. We had shared long term, we view them as at least a 6% to 7% growth business. We certainly see that well intact. And again, the business isn't missing a beat coming into the BD. They didn't do it, miss it at all in the month that they've been part of us and that's continuing as we go into this fiscal year. I think on the integration side, we had shared this when we announced the deal. One of the key rationales for us coming together was the fact that one of the things when we talk to our customers on medication management is that their most critically ill patients, there's a really important connection between understanding their hemodynamics, right which is really their blood pressure real time and the medications because that's what's managing that hemodynamic -- it's being managed by medications and fluid intake and outtake. And so if you can combine the 2, what's happening in the patient's body with what's going into the patient's body which we know what's going into the patient's body through Alaris and they know what the impact of that is in the patient's body, you can really start letting algorithms and informatics start optimizing that to keep the patient stable and get better outcomes. And that's one of the top 3 things that our customers were asking for in that space. And so we've actually -- as Chris mentioned, we -- part of our P&L this year includes some additional investments in selling, reinvestments from the gross margin expansion also in R&D. That's a project that we funded for '25 that will be led by our APM business. And so it's early but we're already getting after it right from the start. And our teams are really excited about the opportunities to innovate in that space. So, thank you for the question.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Maybe we can turn to capital allocation. Your $1 billion share repurchase announcement over the next 12 to 18 months certainly seems like a positive to me and highlights your views about the value inherent in the stock. A couple of things. Should we be interpreting this as Becton taking maybe a momentary step back from your tuck-in acquisition strategy near term as you integrate APM? Is it their value -- lack of value, lack of compelling candidates and again, more broadly on capital allocation related to dividends or -- and anything else that you want to talk about?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes, Rick. Thanks, it's Chris. Appreciate the question. I guess first, before we get into capital allocation, it starts obviously with strong margins and healthy cash flow. We've been extremely focused on cash flow progression. We had a really strong year in FY '24. We grew our free cash flow by $1 billion and exceeded our goal of free cash flow conversion, ending at about 82%. This gives us more financial flexibility is the way I would think of it. Our capital allocation priorities are largely unchanged. You did see us announce a dividend increase at 9.5%. That's something that's reliable that you can continue to rely on. We've always said that we're going to prioritize remaining free cash flow for tuck-in M&A. But we're in a position where we just digested over $4 billion acquisition. We're focused on capitalizing the value out of APM. It's an extremely exciting opportunity, a durable high single-digit grower. And so we're very excited about that. So we want to remain disciplined about our net leverage glide path down to 2.5x which we'll do in 12 to 18 months. With that said, with the stronger cash flow position we have and continued momentum in driving a strong cash flow position in '25, we just felt like given what we see a strong intrinsic value of BD, we could kind of step up the level of share repurchases to about $1 billion over that same time frame while still consistently executing against the 2.5x net leverage. So, I think it's another important part. I appreciate you asking the question. We've been very focused on cash flow and we'll continue to do so.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, Rich.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for any additional or closing comments.\nTom Polen: Well, thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to take a moment and again, thank our global team of associates who are advancing our strategy, supporting our customers and improving the lives of the patients we serve. We believe we are well positioned heading into FY '25 with multiple growth drivers across our portfolio enabling us to effectively navigate market dynamics and momentum in BD Excellence driving margin expansion to deliver a strong earnings and cash profile. We look forward to connecting with everyone on our Q1 call in February, and again at our Investor Day. Thank you for your continued support of BD.\nOperator: This does conclude this audio webcast. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Mike Garrison",
            "content": "No, just we're really -- as you mentioned, we're really proud of the performance. I think from the standpoint, yes, we did exceed the $350 million. Larry, just to answer that question directly. In the medical number which was really positive for the quarter and MMS in particular, was really positive. There is a very difficult compared to last year with dispensing. We had a very, very strong year last year with dispensing, gained position, did a great job implementing and that continued through the year but just from a quarter-to-quarter comparison year-on-year, there's a little bit of an offset there. So Alaris actually did quite well in the quarter and we feel good. We feel good kind of feeling like next year, it's sort of business as usual. We're back to normal in terms of operating the business and continuing to serve customers. We feel good about the committed contract backlog that's been built throughout the year and the progression of how customers have moved through our sales funnel and our ability to ramp up service, ramp up manufacturing, things like that."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Mike Feld, President of our Life Science segment, who joined BD in August from Veralto. Mike is known for building innovative, high-performing teams and his leadership principles are well aligned with BD's culture. Mike also brings deep experience in Shingijutsu Kaizen which is the heartbeat behind BD Excellence. There is no individual more suited to lead the Life Sciences team as they continue to expand the value BD brings to our customers and I look forward to Mike's partnership as we deliver on our strategy. Earlier today, we reported strong Q4 results with 7.4% revenue growth or 6.2% organic, 120 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS up 11.4%. For the full year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 5%. Despite fiscal '24 revenue growth that was below our initial expectations, we are pleased with how we navigated complex market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. Breaking things down, our MedTech and Diagnostics businesses grew a strong 5.9% this year, inclusive of absorbing a decrease in China, while our Bioscience-Pharma businesses grew about 1%, roughly in line with the end markets. Over the long term, we see Bioscience-Pharma as a durable, higher growth contributors to our portfolio and we remain confident in gradual market recovery, our competitive position and the team's execution. We consistently executed on margin expansion in FY '24, increasing adjusted EPS guidance each quarter and delivering full-year EPS of $13.14, adjusted operating margin of 24.2% and free cash flow of $3.1 billion, all ahead of our original plan and positioning us well moving into FY '25. I'd like to thank our global team of associates whose passionate commitment and focused execution of our strategy is making meaningful impact for the customers and patients we serve. Reflecting more broadly on our strategic direction and progress this past year, we made important advancements on each of our top 3 priorities. which are: one, drive sustained topline growth through high-impact innovation and commercial excellence; two, execute on BD Excellence to drive operational performance; and three, effectively deploy capital. First, on growth. We advanced multiple new growth platforms that put BD in the middle of the most significant trends reshaping health care, including the use of AI and automation in connected care to transform efficiency and outcomes, the shift to new care settings and the application of medical technology to improve treatment of chronic disease. Starting with our BD Medical segment. New biologic drugs promise to have the most significant impact on chronic disease in the history of modern medicine. In FY '24, we passed $1 billion of annual revenue in biologic drug delivery sales, driven by our leading prefillable devices and increased manufacturing capacity to serve growing GLP-1 demand. As the leader in biologics drug delivery and with a growing pipeline of targeted innovations such as our Libertas and Evolve wearable devices, we believe no company is better positioned than BD to capitalize on a significant growth opportunity. We continue to advance our platform for pharmacy robotics which now ranks as one of the largest robotics businesses in med tech and is enabling the transformation of retail, online and hospital pharmacies with significant opportunity for future growth. We're also extremely pleased with the first year of the Alaris return to market and its role in our connected medication management strategy. We exited the year at our historical revenue run rate and continue to see strong customer preference for the Alaris Power of One. Our acquisition of advanced patient monitoring in FY '24 expands our connected care solutions in a high-growth market and enables future innovation opportunities in breakthrough closed-loop monitoring and treatment which BD is uniquely positioned to deliver across our platforms. Integration is going as expected and the commercial teams are fully engaged in maximizing the benefits of APM for our customers. In BD Interventional, we had a fantastic year advancing our PureWick urinary incontinence platform, launching our next-gen PureWick Flex and expanding PureWick Male into the home. In our advanced tissue regeneration portfolio, Phasix and GalaFLEX are additional examples of how our tuck-in M&A strategy is now driving strong organic growth. We continue to transform hernia surgery and are expanding this platform into new applications for plastic and reconstructive procedures, driven by trends in aging and GLP-1 weight loss which increasingly call for soft tissue support to restore function and improve appearance. Across BD Life Sciences, we continue to reinvent the field of flow cytometry with the launch of the 3 in 4 laser FACSDiscover S8 Sorter and multiple new reagents using unique AI algorithms to optimize dye designs that are enabling new scientific insights. In Diagnostics, our new high-throughput molecular platform, BD COR and Onclarity HPV assay, continued to gain traction with self-collection and new care settings for cervical cancer screening now available in many countries around the world, representing a meaningful new growth opportunity for BD. While these and other new BD innovations are playing a key role in transforming care, most every significant healthcare procedure uses a BD COR device whether robotic surgeries, valve transplant, new cancer treatment or advanced vascular procedures, BD syringes, catheters, pumps, surgical prep, blood collection and other products are there. In FY '24, we saw strong growth across our core devices, driven by share gains and procedural volumes. Turning to operational performance; we launched BD Excellence about 18 months ago. And it's been incredible to see the momentum behind simplifying our company, improving quality and accelerating margin progression. Through BD Excellence, our team has made strong progress on network optimization, increasing plant productivity and delivering double-digit improvements in waste and operating equipment efficiency or OEE. All of this drove margins, EPS and cash flow above plan. We have much more headroom going forward through BD Excellence and it positions us well to deliver on our goals for FY '25 and beyond. On our third priority of strong stewardship of value-creating capital deployment, our focus on cash generation enabled strong growth in free cash flow, increased free cash flow conversion and allowed us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Earlier this morning, we announced our 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases, extending our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy. Meaningful return of capital to shareholders will remain a key priority in our capital allocation strategy going forward. Beyond those priorities, in FY '24, we expanded our position as a leader in corporate responsibility, with significant progress toward our 2030 corporate sustainability goals. We became one of a handful of med tech companies to have near- and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and net zero targets approved by the science-based target initiative. We surpassed both our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions targets. And as part of our ongoing health equity strategy, we advanced partnerships around the world in areas such as improving access to cervical and breast cancer screening. We are pleased to be recognized for our efforts, most recently being named a 3BL's list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and ranking in the top 2 in health care. Looking ahead to FY '25, we will continue to execute in alignment with each of those 3 priorities. We have more than 25 planned new product launches this year and calling out just a few. In BD Medical, we're launching our next-generation Pyxis platform which includes the cadence of hardware and software upgrades and releases which will begin to roll out by the end of calendar year '25 and continue for the next several years. This will be the first system to use BD's new advanced AI platform that will integrate data across BD smart devices. We have a number of new launches planned in our advanced patient monitoring business to revolutionize hemodynamic monitoring. The next-gen HemoSphere Alta Monitor will feature a full range of sensors enabled with predictive IQ algorithms that provide comprehensive pressure, flow and tissue oxygenation insights for varying acuities. New Swan IQ and ForeSight IQ smart sensors will provide new patient insights, including new-to-world right heart pressures and cerebral oxygenation. In BD Life Sciences, we plan to launch the first BD FACSDiscover Analyzer, the A8, to provide customers with high-throughput sample analysis with the same innovative technologies as our breakthrough Cell Sorter. And lastly, in BD Interventional, in our PureWick platform, we're advancing the pivotal study for at-home reimbursement and expect to continue the cadence of innovation with the launch of PureWick Portable, a solution that restores mobility to people's lives. We look forward to sharing a full portfolio update at our Investor Day on February 26 at the New York Stock Exchange. We believe we are well positioned heading into FY '25, with the strength of our portfolio enabling us to effectively navigate market dynamics and the momentum of BD Excellence driving margin expansion to deliver a strong earnings and cash profile. I'll now turn it to Chris to provide further color on our financials and outlook. Okay. Vijay, I appreciate the comments there. So I'll start off with just some comments on some of our assumptions for the year and then I'll turn it over to Chris to speak to the phasing. So stepping back more broadly as we think about the life science and bioscience space, as you said, we recognize for the full year, we obviously had to make an adjustment midyear that was below our initial guide to reflect the dynamics that are going on in that market. And while we had a very strong Q4, we also recognized that while it was within our range, it was the organic number was modestly below the Street expectation given those dynamics. What I think as we step back, we're really pleased with how our teams have navigated those spaces. If you just break out FY '24, we grew 5% overall as a company. That's 5.9% in our med tech diagnostics business and about 1% in that biopharma or biosciences-pharma space for the full year. If you look at Q4, we were 7.5% growth in the med tech diagnostics space, 1.3% in the bioscience-pharma space. So as you mentioned, Q4 was a little bit of an uptick in the bioscience-pharma versus the full year period. But both of those, obviously, very strong on the med tech diagnostic core businesses. And even at 1% for the full year or the 1.3% for the quarter, it was very competitive versus what you're seeing more broadly in the market in those spaces. And so we're pleased with our portfolio. We're pleased with how our teams are executing. And as we look forward, I think we've been -- let me start with maybe just a comment on China since you commented on that, too and how we've built that into our assumptions for FY '25. I think I've been consistent in taking a cautious view on China in the near term but also being very positive on the long term, given the large structural unmet healthcare needs and the opportunity for our local capabilities and portfolio to help serve those. And so in China, you're seeing value-based procurement dynamics pretty broad across the industry. We continue to see all throughout FY '24, we expect it to continue very strong volume growth in China but offset by the impact of VBP on price. Long term, we -- because we're holding a very strong position in the market, we think that's the right thing to do long term and we feel good about our long-term strategic position. But for FY '25, we built in mid-single-digit decline in China into our guide assumptions. That assumes continued very strong volume growth, continued holding our position very nicely there. But overall, that combination still resulting in a mid-single-digit decline that we've built into our guide. We think that's prudent. On the bioscience-pharma space, it's -- we've seen some uptick, as you mentioned, in Q4. I think it's still too early to forecast with high certainty what a recovery curve and timing looks like there. And so we're taking a prudent position on our guide and have that continuing at a rate similar to '24. Again, we really like our position in both the pharma space and in biosciences. We've got a lot of great innovation. We're extremely well positioned in the biologics. It's interesting, those 2 spaces that are going through transitory market dynamics. Of course, those 2 have been 2 of the fastest-growing businesses for BD over the last several years. And we expect they'll return to being 2 of the fastest-growing businesses in BD over the more mid- and long term. But we do think, given those dynamics that you mentioned, it's prudent for us to take a position that we've built into our guide. Just on the hurricane and then I'll turn it over to Chris on phasing. On the hurricane, we're not seeing any impact of that today. I'd say we're monitoring closely the -- any impacts that it could have on procedure volumes. I'm not seeing that broadly at this point. That's just something we're watching and we'll monitor as we see the recovery of that. There's some modest and small. We're focused on servicing our customers. People are using maybe larger volume syringes a bit more as replacement. There are some other products that could help substitute for those where there's gaps in IVs. But overall, we're focusing on servicing our customers during this period of time but we don't see a significant impact to the business. It's something we're monitoring. Yes. Thanks for the question, Larry. I'll start off and maybe turn it to Mike here in a moment. But we're really pleased with the first full year of Alaris launches. As we had shared midyear as we updated our outlook for Alaris. We expected Alaris to be back at the historical run rate within the first year of launch. And in fact, we saw that come through as expected. And so we feel good as we go into FY '25, also with having built a backlog of committed contracts which is something that we're also focused on rebuilding as we relaunched here this year. Maybe, Mike, any additional comments to that? Maybe just one last thing to add is we really did -- the team did a great job on the remediation efforts as well. We're very much on track. And then we do expect continued strong growth in Alaris as we go into FY '25. So thank you for the question, Larry. Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. We feel really good about the -- how we've been moving BD into higher growth spaces. And you've seen that over the last several years, right? If you look at our underlying topline growth, we always look at it without COVID testing in there, it's been quite strong, right, north of 6% underlying growth for the company in our core business. And then obviously, we've got some transitory dynamics here that are affecting 2 of our strongest growing businesses over that period of time which are extremely well positioned in fast-growing spaces, right, biologic drug delivery and life science research on single cell or on cell analysis. So as we think about going forward, we continue to view the overall WAMGR of our spaces at about 5%. We don't change that for the short-term transitory dynamics that one sees happening in destocking in pharma or on the life science research side. And so we feel good about that. A number of the -- if you step back and I look at BD 2025 and how we've progressed there, we've got multiple growth platforms and levers now that -- many of which didn't exist at the start of BD 2025, whether or not that's our growth in biologics and GLP-1s which just crossed the $1 billion size this past year now, $1 billion of biologic drug delivery, the largest of any in the space and we're really well positioned there. The pharmacy automation to advanced patient monitoring now, a strong growth business. Our tissue reconstruction and infection prevention that you're seeing do really well in surgery, a PureWick platform which, as we've shared, we view as a $1 billion business opportunity by 2030, high throughput molecular on the diagnostics side. So we really like our position and the portfolio and the spaces that we're in. We're going to continue to reshape -- to continue to advance the portfolio in those spaces and capitalize on the opportunities that we've built. So thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. Thanks for the question, Patrick. From a tariff perspective, when we saw this dynamic that happened in the past, we were -- we didn't see significant impacts from that. Just as a reminder, from a China perspective, our strategy has always been strong local manufacturing in China for China. There's actually only really one product that we export from China today. And it's quite small in the grand scheme of BD. So as we go forward, that's something we'll certainly watch but our strategy is -- has been across the board and particularly given the volumes that we talk about when we're moving billions of units, right, our network is set up to serve local markets with heavy local manufacturing in many cases. We're a very strong domestic manufacturer in the U.S. Obviously, many things in Europe are served out of Europe, etcetera. But that's a space that we'll continue to obviously monitor that. But we do well navigating it the last time. Thanks for the question, Patrick. Yes. Thank you for the question, Matt. You're kind of teeing us up for our Investor Day on February 26, where we'll actually get to highlight and demo some of what we're doing there which we're really excited about. So if you just step back, BD has been focused in this space for quite a number of years.

Of course, our new to BD business that we're really excited about, advanced patient monitoring has been doing a great job using AI building into their algorithms to help predict where there could be hemodynamic changes in the future.

As we think about -- we did highlight for the first time in our deck and in the discussion, just some of the products that they're launching this year that we're excited about. We had shared long term, we view them as at least a 6% to 7% growth business. We certainly see that well intact. And again, the business isn't missing a beat coming into the BD. They didn't do it, miss it at all in the month that they've been part of us and that's continuing as we go into this fiscal year. I think on the integration side, we had shared this when we announced the deal. One of the key rationales for us coming together was the fact that one of the things when we talk to our customers on medication management is that their most critically ill patients, there's a really important connection between understanding their hemodynamics, right which is really their blood pressure real time and the medications because that's what's managing that hemodynamic -- it's being managed by medications and fluid intake and outtake. And so if you can combine the 2, what's happening in the patient's body with what's going into the patient's body which we know what's going into the patient's body through Alaris and they know what the impact of that is in the patient's body, you can really start letting algorithms and informatics start optimizing that to keep the patient stable and get better outcomes. And that's one of the top 3 things that our customers were asking for in that space. And so we've actually -- as Chris mentioned, we -- part of our P&L this year includes some additional investments in selling, reinvestments from the gross margin expansion also in R&D. That's a project that we funded for '25 that will be led by our APM business. And so it's early but we're already getting after it right from the start. And our teams are really excited about the opportunities to innovate in that space. So, thank you for the question. Thanks for the question, Rich. Well, thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to take a moment and again, thank our global team of associates who are advancing our strategy, supporting our customers and improving the lives of the patients we serve. We believe we are well positioned heading into FY '25 with multiple growth drivers across our portfolio enabling us to effectively navigate market dynamics and momentum in BD Excellence driving margin expansion to deliver a strong earnings and cash profile. We look forward to connecting with everyone on our Q1 call in February, and again at our Investor Day. Thank you for your continued support of BD."

            "name": "Chris DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered competitive organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year even while navigating market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. And importantly, with strong execution of our BD Excellence programs, we exceeded our full-year margin, earnings and cash flow goals. I'll now provide some further insight into our Q4 revenue performance. BD Medical organic growth was led by MMS with another quarter of exceptional performance in infusion systems, driven by the BD Alaris return to market. Higher pull-through and utilization of infusion sets also contributed to MMS growth. The unit's performance was partially offset by a tough prior year comparison in dispensing. Our MDS consumable portfolio also contributed to the segment's Q4 growth. We continue to advance our position in the U.S. with broad volume growth and share gains, particularly in our hypodermic and vascular access management portfolios, where our quality and agility to meet increased demand has positively benefited healthcare delivery across our markets. Pharm systems performance reflects another quarter of double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologic drugs, primarily GLP-1s which was partially offset by market dynamics across the industry, including expected customer inventory destocking. Rounding out the BD Medical segment, in early September, we closed the acquisition of Edwards Critical Care, now Advanced Patient Monitoring or APM which contributed $74 million to BD Medical revenue. BD Life Sciences performance was led by IDS. Strong mid-single-digit growth in specimen management was driven by volume growth as investment in our U.S. direct sales team drove increased demand and customer upgrades to higher-value products to provide an enhanced patient experience. Within our Diagnostics business, our results reflect some tough prior-year comparisons in lab automation and ID/AST. Offsetting these impacts was good traction leveraging our molecular platform installed base with double-digit growth in both BD MAX and BD COR. BD Life Sciences growth was partially offset by transitory market dynamics in Biosciences that resulted in lower market demand for research instruments and reagents. Clinical Solutions grew double digits, led by our FACSLyric cell analyzer and cancer reagents. We continue to outperform our life science peers given our portfolio mix of leading instruments, including the BD FACSDiscover, antibodies, dyes and software. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in BDB as a number of new innovations are driving share gains. Strong organic growth in BD Interventional was led by double-digit growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise. PureWick Female grew double digits and PureWick Male delivered its strongest quarter since its launch in acute care. We are also very pleased with the male direct-to-consumer launch, where the first few months of revenues exceeded our expectations. Surgery delivered another quarter of above-market growth. Within advanced repair and reconstruction, continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold drove double-digit growth. It was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year in synthetic mesh. Performance in Surgery was also driven by double-digit growth in infection prevention due to increased demand for ChloraPrep related to strong procedural volumes. BDI performance was also supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease and high single-digit growth in end-stage kidney disease. PI growth was partially offset by a decrease in oncology due to prior year distributor inventory stocking in the U.S. Now, moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.81 reflects double-digit growth of 11.4%. Consistent with our commitments, we delivered strong margin progression in Q4 with adjusted gross margin up 30 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% and adjusted operating margin up 140 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points year-over-year to 26.6%. Margin expansion was driven by strong leverage on our revenue performance and simplification and efficiencies from BD Excellence. For the full year, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $13.14 which represents growth of 7.6%. Adjusted gross margin of 53.3% was in line with our expectations. As planned, strong execution of BD Excellence enabled us to absorb outsized inflation, transactional FX and about 50 basis points from inventory optimization carryover that supported strong fiscal year '24 cash flow. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 24.2%, exceeding our margin goal for the year, driven by shipping and SG&A leverage. While delivering strong margin performance, we also invested $1.1 billion in R&D to advance our pipeline of innovative programs that will support future growth. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, our strategic choices of strong execution on cash flow optimization drove a $1 billion or 47% increase in free cash flow to $3.1 billion and a larger-than-expected improvement in free cash flow conversion by 22 percentage points to 82%. Broad-based improvements in working capital, including our strategic choice to optimize inventory levels, continued expense management and our ability to leverage capital expenditures from BD Excellence productivity gains were all key factors driving strong execution this year. We also benefited from the timing of certain discrete cash items. Our strong cash position supported our acquisition of APM while also returning $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cash and short-term investments on September 30 totaled $2.2 billion, inclusive of about $900 million in proceeds from February's debt refinancing. After closing the Advanced Patient Monitoring acquisition, we ended the year with net leverage of 3x which was in line with our expectations. We believe we are well positioned to deleverage to our 2.5x target over the next 12 to 18 months. We remain focused on underlying cash flow improvements. Despite the timing impact of some discrete cash items, we expect next year's organic free cash flow conversion to be consistent with this year due to strong execution in working capital. As expected, due to integration-related investments for APM, we anticipate a moderate step back in free cash flow conversion to around 75%. However, we expect this will still result in another strong year of free cash flow dollars which will support investments in growth, debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders. Given the outperformance this year and our confidence in next year's plans, we believe we are in a strong position to execute our net leverage commitments and plan to deploy about $1 billion towards share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months, while still delivering on our deleveraging target of about 2.5x within this time frame. We see this as a value-creating opportunity based on our view of BD's intrinsic value. Moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25. Our initial fiscal year '25 guidance is anchored on high single-digit revenue growth driven by the contribution from APM and a broad-based competitive organic revenue growth profile that captures a prudent view of market dynamics in China and Bioscience-Pharma. We expect increasing momentum from BD Excellence to drive significant margin expansion which will enable delivery of strong adjusted EPS growth of about 10% at the midpoint. This growth includes increased acquisition-related interest expense and a higher tax rate inclusive of Pillar 2. We expect to deliver total revenues in the range of $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion in fiscal year '25 which reflects a modest foreign currency translation impact of 25 basis points and currency-neutral adjusted revenue growth of 8.8% to 9.3%. This includes strong performance from our newly acquired APM business, consistent with what we previously shared, plus organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. This includes absorbing about 125 basis points impact from China and Bioscience-Pharma with China expected to decrease by mid-single digits. Across the balance of our portfolio which represents about 75% of our total organic revenue, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth around our 5.5% plus growth profile. Moving to margins and earnings. We are confident in delivering another year of strong operational performance, particularly our ability to expand adjusted operating margin by about 100 basis points and exceed our 25% margin goal we set over 2 years ago. The primary driver of margin expansion in fiscal year '25 is expected to come from gross margin with an increasing benefit from accelerating BD Excellence momentum. Below gross margin, we expect some leverage primarily in shipping and G&A, offset by increasing investments in selling and R&D to further support our growth profile. We expect interest and other to be up year-over-year, primarily due to the debt issued in connection with the Advanced Patient Monitoring acquisition. For tax, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 14% and 15.5% which includes the impact of Pillar 2. As a reminder, it would not be unusual for our tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Given these considerations, we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $14.25 to $14.60, inclusive of a modest foreign currency translation headwind. As you think about fiscal 2025 phasing, we expect first half revenue growth to be modestly below the low end of our total revenue guidance and the second half to be modestly above the high end. This includes our expectation of a heavier impact to first half revenue growth from the expected decrease in China revenues, a larger impact from Bioscience-Pharma dynamics in Q1 and the comparison to prior year licensing revenue in Q2. As revenue dollars increase sequentially throughout the year, we expect the benefit from BD excellence and strong OpEx leverage to result in increasing adjusted gross and operating margins throughout the year. This results in strong year-over-year growth in OIBT each quarter. Based on a ratable tax rate, we expect first half and second half adjusted EPS growth rate to be ratable which implies about 10% growth at the midpoint of our full year guidance range and is a nicely balanced phasing profile. In closing, our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum. We expect to deliver competitive growth that appropriately plans for market dynamics in China and bioscience pharma. Accelerating momentum in BD Excellence is supporting strong margin expansion, enabling investment in R&D to support further growth. This coupled with strong cash generation and a disciplined approach to capital allocation is expected to drive continued value creation for all of our stakeholders. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue? Vijay, it's Chris. On the phasing, just so a couple of things. One, relative to where we were last year, like to Tom's point, we've taken a very prudent posture as it relates to the market dynamics that are real. We're not alone there, to your point. We have businesses competing there. As you think of our total phasing and balance across the year, it's actually pretty balanced certainly on earnings, first of all, I shared in the script, first half, second half, very balanced relative to the midpoint of the growth rate of our guide at about 10%. So you don't see a lot of fluctuation there. You're going to see a strong starting gross margin as you think of Q1 and a steady kind of normalized increase as we move through the year sequentially there. So I think as it relates to kind of P&L dynamics, very strong. On revenue, we did share that you're going to have a first half, second half dynamic where the growth rate will be below the low end of the total guide range for the first half. It will be above for the second half. One way to think of it, though, is maybe more look at the dollar phasing as a percent of dollars by quarter as we move through the year. We tend to have a lower first half versus second half. We're about 48%, 52% when you think of dollars as a percent of total, with Q1 being lower than the average of the 48%. You're going to see some nuances with the growth rate in Q1 that will be low. Remember, the market dynamics will be most prominent in Q1. And actually last year, both BDB and pharm systems, where we had these businesses, we're still at about mid-single digits if you go back and look at their performance. So you actually also have a comp in the quarter that's impacting us. Yes. Thanks, Travis. It's Chris. I'll try and give a little extra color. I think consistent with what I've said, again, the BD profile in terms of how revenue ramps on an absolute dollar basis, it's actually pretty consistent with what you typically see. This is really all about, again, Q1, these market dynamics, you have 2 businesses that were growing mid-single digits last year. So you actually have a headwind in our comp. I know our growth rate looked low last year. But if you recall, we were cycling through moving respiratory into our base business and there was a big respiratory comp in Q1 which has no effect on this year as you think of growth rate. So really, you have a headwind when you think of year-over-year growth rates. And we feel good. So we're not reflecting substantial improvement in market dynamics as we move through the year. Q1 is the biggest. And then I would say we continue to see what I would call certainly well below our kind of normal growth rate on top line for those businesses that are market impacted. Like I said, more importantly, on earnings, we have a super balanced earnings per share growth profile with about right around the midpoint of our guide for first half, second half and you're going to see strong margins out of the gate with Q1 year-over-year margin improvement and then what I would call just a nice glide path of sequential margin improvement throughout the year. Yes. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. So we couldn't be more excited about kind of how we're shaping the P&L. The focus on BD excellence. You saw it in the back half of FY '24, all the progress we're making on gross margin. So we talked about year-over-year delivering about 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. However, this will be the first year that is predominantly coming from gross margin allows us to kind of reshape the P&L. We have differentiated levels that will enable growth as you think of selling specifically and R&D, so both shorter term and long term. And so we view this as a very healthy P&L. Obviously, if you go back to BD 2025 when we first rolled that out, at the time the market complexity and significant outsized inflation was not there. So we've been doing great things in gross margin but a lot of it has been covering those headwinds. Now you're seeing that play out. '25 is the first year that shows up, as we talk more in our upcoming Investor Day. That strategy will certainly continue and we see that as a key value driver on a go-forward basis. Thanks for the question, David. Yes, Rick. Thanks, it's Chris. Appreciate the question. I guess first, before we get into capital allocation, it starts obviously with strong margins and healthy cash flow. We've been extremely focused on cash flow progression. We had a really strong year in FY '24. We grew our free cash flow by $1 billion and exceeded our goal of free cash flow conversion, ending at about 82%. This gives us more financial flexibility is the way I would think of it. Our capital allocation priorities are largely unchanged. You did see us announce a dividend increase at 9.5%. That's something that's reliable that you can continue to rely on. We've always said that we're going to prioritize remaining free cash flow for tuck-in M&A. But we're in a position where we just digested over $4 billion acquisition. We're focused on capitalizing the value out of APM. It's an extremely exciting opportunity, a durable high single-digit grower. And so we're very excited about that. So we want to remain disciplined about our net leverage glide path down to 2.5x which we'll do in 12 to 18 months. With that said, with the stronger cash flow position we have and continued momentum in driving a strong cash flow position in '25, we just felt like given what we see a strong intrinsic value of BD, we could kind of step up the level of share repurchases to about $1 billion over that same time frame while still consistently executing against the 2.5x net leverage. So, I think it's another important part. I appreciate you asking the question. We've been very focused on cash flow and we'll continue to do so."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com or by phone at 800-839-2385 for domestic calls and area code +1 402-220-7203 for international calls. For today's call, all parties have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreg Rodetis: Good morning and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD releases results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com. Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents: Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation. Specifically, during the quarter, we recorded accruals resulting from recent developments relating primarily to the Italian government medical device payback legislation which essentially relates to years prior to the current fiscal year. We are presenting adjusted revenues, excluding the impact of these accruals. With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress advancing our BD 2025 strategy. This quarter demonstrates the durability of our portfolio and strength of new innovations, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth of 5.2%. Growth was broad-based and reflects strong volume and share gains across the portfolio. Our team executed very well through transitory market dynamics in BDB and PS [ph] and macro factors in China. We continue to grow above the market and believe we are extremely well positioned as these markets recover. We have growing momentum from our BD Excellence operating system that enabled us to deliver significant sequential and year-over-year adjusted gross margin increases. This drove strong operating margin expansion contributed to over 18% adjusted earnings per share growth and is allowing us to raise our earnings guidance once again. Our team's excellent execution also drove over 100% year-to-date growth in free cash flow, reaching over 80% free cash flow conversion year-to-date, with margins, earnings and cash flow all ahead of plan. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: driving growth through innovation and tuck-in M&A, simplifying through BD Excellence and empowering our organization with the capabilities and systems to deliver on our strategy. I'd like to provide updates on each of these this morning. Starting with our growth pillar and the Critical Care acquisition. Things continue to progress well towards a successful close and as we've gotten to know more members of their team, we only become more excited to welcome them to the BD family. Critical Care significantly advances our connected care strategy to use AI and digital tools to help clinicians deliver more efficient and higher quality care. Additionally, it adds a high-growth business that is immediately accretive to margins and earnings. Turning to several of our most significant long-term growth drivers. To begin with, our connected medication management strategy has strong momentum, with Q3 setting another new all-time record for the number of Alaris pumps shipped in a quarter. The scale of upgrading our fleet is unprecedented and I'm very proud of the work our teams are doing to support our loyal customer base and deliver ahead of our commitments. Customer feedback has been very positive and we gained a market position in the quarter. We are now back at our historical quarterly run rate of about $100 million and have built a healthy committed contract backlog which puts us in a position to be above our historical run rate for FY '25. Our connected medication management portfolio which includes Alaris, is just one example of how BD is at the forefront of combining AI, automation and robotics to improve the core processes that run health care. Through our strategy, BD is advancing our leadership in automating the pharmacy, the medication management process and the microbiology lab. Today, BD has a $4 billion-plus business in health care automation and informatics AI and we'll increase this to over $5 billion as we complete the acquisition of Critical Care. This expands BD in the smart critical care space and creates new opportunities to combine AI-driven monitoring with systems such as infusion technologies to simplify nursing workflow and improve patient care. Looking ahead to 2030, we view health care process automation and informatics AI as having the potential to become a business exceeding $7 billion as we continue to build more connected, automated and intelligent solutions to transform the core processes underlying care delivery. Turning to other key platforms. Q3 was the 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our PureWick platform. In our recently launched next-generation female external catheter, PureWick Flex, is expected to support this continued momentum. PureWick Flex delivers improved performance for a wider range of body types, both in acute and home care settings. Given the incredible response from the first PureWick Flex users, we couldn't be more excited about the impact this will have on patients and their providers. As I think about PureWick overall, we see this as having the potential to become a $1 billion franchise by 2030, continuing its double-digit growth momentum. We're also advancing our impact in immune health in oncology, continuing the super cycle of innovation within BD Biosciences which positions it well as a long-term growth driver. Coming off the landmark BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter launch in FY '23, we recently released additional 3 and 4 laser configurations which contain the same new-to-world BD SpectralFX and BD CellView technologies, enabling new discoveries in a broader range of fields. We expect to continue our innovation cadence with our FY '25 launch of the BD FACSDiscover A8 Analyzer which will provide customers high-throughput sample analysis with the same innovative technologies. The combination of BD FACSDiscover and our BD RealBlue and RealYellow reagents were used in the world's first 50 color flow cytometry experiment which was published this year in the Journal of Cytometry. This serves as a testament to these ground-breaking new technologies. The immune health and oncology space remains a primary focus for research and as the market returns to growth, we believe a leading technology and portfolio position us well to capitalize on future opportunities in this space. Finally, within our Pharmaceutical Systems business, in Q3, biologics drug delivery continued to grow double digits. Biologics now represent over 40% of our total Pharmaceutical Systems revenue and we see it as a significant growth opportunity, including GLP-1s. Since the start of BD 2025, we've been implementing a strategy to enhance our innovation leadership, expand our manufacturing scale and prioritize quality excellence to be the preferred partner for biologic drug delivery. And we believe that no other company in med tech is better positioned than BD to capitalize on this trend. First, the majority of biologics that use a prefilled syringe have and continue to be launched in the BD device. Since 2023, BD has been the chosen partner for 19 out of the 23 new biologic drug approvals that use a prefilled syringe. Second, as we consider the significant clinical potentials of GLP-1s, the strength of BD's innovation in this category and our previously announced capacity expansion, we view GLP-1 drug delivery as a potential $1 billion product category by 2030. Today, we serve multiple market leaders, have device contracts with multiple novel GLP-1 therapies advancing through clinical trials and beyond novel molecules, we now have over 40 signed GLP-1 biosimilar agreements across our pen [ph], auto-injector and syringe platforms. We are actively supporting biosimilars for early generation GLP-1s that are entering the market over the next 12 months. Outside of GLP-1s, our customers are working to develop next-generation biologics that have the potential to revolutionize care and conditions like Alzheimer's, certain immunological disorders and types of cancer. Many of these are extremely complex molecules and proteins that will involve significantly greater volumes for injection and higher viscosity compared to therapies presently available in the market. At the same time, we see the trends to enable patient self-treatment that point to the need for wearable on-body injectors. We've developed the BD Libertas and BD Evolve wearable injectors to support the unique delivery needs of these therapies. We're actively supporting multiple customers testing their pipeline molecules with our wearable solutions and have provided product to support their clinical trials. While this is a longer-term opportunity that we expect to develop in line with drug development time lines, we believe we are well positioned for this future trend and are getting very positive feedback on our platforms. Moving to our simplification strategy and BD Excellence. First, let me express my gratitude to everyone in our organization who is accelerating BD Excellence through our global supply chain, through the completion of over 500 Kaizen events this year. I especially like to thank those working in our manufacturing plants and warehouses to improve product quality and reliability for our customers this year while delivering double-digit improvements in both waste reduction and production yield. We are seeing the outcomes of BD Excellence in accelerating margin progression and delivering strong cash flow. Our plans to reduce our manufacturing network by over 20% remain on track. And as we are consolidating our plant architecture, we're investing in smart factories. Our top 30 sites are already accelerating performance, leveraging smart automation and digital capabilities such as predictive analytics. We're excited about the opportunity to further accelerate manufacturing productivity through the combination of BD Excellence and our smart factory strategy. The momentum in our simplification programs, including BD Excellence, positions us for success as we finish FY '24 and as we look ahead to FY '25 and beyond. Lastly, we continue to empower our organization through strong corporate responsibility and recently issued our FY '23 Corporate Sustainability Report. Notably, in FY '23, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, 18% versus our FY '19 baseline, surpassing our goal of 13%. We doubled the number of sites using green electric power and solar power and we reduced our water usage by 21% and waste by 18% over the same time frame. In summary, we delivered above-market mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and significant margin expansion and cash flow generation. On the strength in the quarter, we are once again raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned for continued strong financial performance next year. We have leadership positions in many of the most significant trends reshaping health care, positioning us well in FY '25 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\nChris DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, the quarter's results reflect strong performance across multiple parts of our portfolio, even amid the previously noted transitory market dynamics and macro factors. Importantly, with strong execution of our BD Excellence programs, we exceeded our margin, earnings and cash flow goals. I'll now provide some further insight into our adjusted revenue performance. Q3 revenue grew 5.2% organic, driven by volume growth and share gains. Regionally, over 90% of our revenue which includes our 3 largest geographies, grew 6% plus organic. This strong performance was partially offset by a decrease in China from continued market dynamics. BD Medical growth was led by MMS with exceptional performance in infusion systems, driven by the BD Alaris return to market and higher utilization of infusion sets, partially offset by a tough prior year comparison in dispensing. Broad volume growth and share gains across our MDS consumable portfolio in developed markets also contributed to the segment's growth. Pharm Systems had another quarter of increasing demand with double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologic drugs, primarily GLP-1s. This growth was offset by transitory market dynamics across the industry, including expected customer inventory destocking. BD Life Sciences performance was led by IDS with high single-digit growth in specimen management which reflects both increased utilization and customer upgrades to higher-value products to provide an enhanced patient experience. The segment's growth was partially offset by transitory market dynamics in biosciences that resulted in lower market demand for instruments. Given our leading portfolio in instruments and reagents, we significantly outperformed the category in the quarter. Strong organic growth in BD Interventional was led by high single-digit growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Surgery delivered another strong quarter across all 3 major platforms with double-digit organic growth across advanced repair and reconstruction, infection prevention and biosurgery. We continue to make excellent progress with conversion to our bioresorbable Phasix technology which we see as a durable contributor to future growth. BDI performance was also supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease that was partially offset by a decrease in oncology, driven primarily by market dynamics in China. Now moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential and year-over-year margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 54.3% and adjusted operating margin of 25.2%, both above our expectations. The gross margin year-over-year increase of 170 basis points was primarily driven by increased productivity and cost improvement from our BD Excellence initiatives and moderating inflation. Our operating margin increased by 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by the increase in gross margin and healthy operating expense leverage with expenses increasing slightly on a dollar basis year-over-year. As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q3 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50 which grew double digits or 18.2% on a reported basis. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, I'm really pleased with our strategic choices and the execution on cash flow. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow increased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $2.2 billion reflecting continued improvement in working capital, including continued inventory optimization, planned phasing certain cash flow items and the ability to leverage our capital expenditures as we benefit from BD Excellence productivity gains. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in fiscal year '24, with our year-to-date free cash flow conversion above 80% and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals. Net leverage improved to 2.4x and cash and short-term investments totaled $5.3 billion, inclusive of about $3.4 billion in proceeds from the February debt refinancing and the Critical Care acquisition financing in June. Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead, we are confident in a strong close to fiscal year '24. We remain focused on driving multiple areas of momentum and share gains across our portfolio, including Alaris. For the full year, even with this broad-based momentum, it is prudent for us to reflect the latest market dynamics which others are also experiencing. As a result, we now expect organic revenue growth to be 5% to 5.25% for the full year. Based on the strength of our margin performance, we were able to absorb the revised organic revenue growth guidance and are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $13.05 to $13.15 on a reported basis. This reflects an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint and $0.10 at the bottom of the range. We believe we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of over 50 basis points improvement which implies full year adjusted operating margins of over 24%. We continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD Excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on our expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25. While it's too early to provide guidance as we are in our planning process, I can offer the following thoughts. We are continuing to monitor dynamics in select markets. Even in an environment where these dynamics continue to exist, we are confident in delivering strong performance, particularly our ability to exceed our 25% adjusted operating margin goal and deliver double-digit EPS growth, given the increasing benefit to gross margin from accelerating BD Excellence momentum. We think 10% EPS growth would be a good starting point for fiscal year '25, including Critical Care and the expected impact of Pillar 2. So in summary, based on the durability of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we are confident in delivering another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported overdelivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter Q4, we are on track to exceed our full year margin improvement goals, deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth and once again increase our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD 2025 value creation objectives. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, two for me. First, I wanted to ask on guidance, particularly fourth quarter. What's implied there in revenue guidance and the margins, it looks like, by my math, about 6.5% organic growth and still healthy operating margin performance. Maybe just walk us through some of the things that happened in third quarter that led to the touch lower organic growth and the confidence in fiscal fourth quarter, both from a revenue and a margin perspective where you did well in the quarter.\nTom Polen: Robbie, thanks for the question. This is Tom. I'll start off and then turn it over to Chris. I think as we look at Q3, first off, we're really pleased with strong performance across many areas of almost every area of the company, particularly as we look at compared to market, where we saw strong share gains in a number of areas. We saw a strong volume performance. And even in markets that are undergoing transitory market dynamics, specifically the BDB research market environment and the destocking in Pharm systems. As we look at our performance, I really like our competitive position in those spaces. You're seeing us outperform what's been announced by others to date. And so as those markets ultimately rebound and you heard us talk about some of the new innovations in BDB. Obviously, our position in biologics and the differentiated growth that we're getting there. And the differentiated share gains that we're getting there in terms of our share of new molecules and even biosimilar spaces. We really like our position there long term. So I think that's really -- as we think about Q3, those dynamics in those spaces as well as just the continued play out in China is what we saw. I'll turn it to Chris, just to talk a little bit more about how we think about guidance in Q4. Pretty straightforward.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Robbie, for the question. Yes, Q4 is actually pretty straightforward. So to your point on the top line revenue organic it implies upper 6% range, consistent with what you shared, maybe a little north of that. It's really attributed to one key dynamic. It's the continued momentum of Alaris. By the way, we obviously have a much stronger line of sight based on our committed contract position. This is the strongest quarter that we have this year as it relates to line of sight of that because now we're 3 quarters in that. In addition to that, if you recall, last year in Q4, we have a favorable comp in Alaris as well because we had stopped shipping under medical necessity, as we got the approval and we're preparing for launch. So you actually have a favorable comp and you have continued momentum with Alaris which as you saw was very positive in the quarter. The rest of the portfolio, we actually assume similar performance. So we're not making assumptions of significant market recovery or things of that. We're going to continue to outperform in those spaces from a relative standpoint. So I feel good about revenue. Margin, hopefully, everyone had an opportunity to see, Q3 was really strong. We outperformed margin. It led to the outperformance on EPS. The story there is straightforward. Gross margin, it basically just have to repeat Q3 which is already flowing through our cost base, right? We're in our cap and roll period there. So there's not a substantive change in terms of gross margin. On operating margin, the gross margin will flow through. We're actually increasing expenses slightly from an OpEx standpoint where you end up with that, call it, high 6% growth. You get a little bit of a natural leverage there that will flow through and we feel really good about that. I think importantly and we can talk more about this, pretends well for '25 as we think of margins.\nRobbie Marcus: Well, that's a perfect segue to my follow-up question on fiscal '25. You gave color about 10% EPS growth, I want to make sure that's reported, I think I heard. And there's a lot of moving parts, timing of when Critical Care closes, the accretion that could add, China versus Alaris. When you came up with that -- the 10% which I think is about where the Street is, when we factor in the Critical Care accretion. Maybe just some of the components, I heard 25% operating margin you feel good about. Just anything else you could give us up and down the P&L.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes. Look, we're excited about '25. It's setting up nicely to deliver strong performance. First, top line, I'll just reiterate, we're extremely pleased. Our strategy is paying off in terms of strength of portfolio. Continue to focus on driving volume and share gains. And what you're really seeing in this quarter is the ability to deliver strong performance despite these market dynamics, most notably BDB, Pharm Systems and as Tom noted, China. So we're not dependent on one thing. The durability of our portfolio sets us up nicely. And then from a margin standpoint, I shared that on the momentum we have this year, we expect to now exceed 25%. I think importantly, what you'll see different in '25 going forward is the significant majority of that will come from gross margin. And actually, if you look at where we are in the back half of the year, you can kind of think of Q3 as sort of a nice number directionally to think of '25 and carrying that through. So I feel very good about line of sight to margin. As you noted, we're excited about Critical Care. It just gives us another positive catalyst to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth. We are contemplating headwinds from Pillar 2. So still more to come on that. It's premature to share specifics but we do anticipate that's a headwind that we will absorb as part of that. And so all that collectively sets us up nicely, to your point, I think what I see externally where the Street is, we would see that more in the low end of the range and it would be 10% and that is on a reported basis. So FX at this point, there's a modest headwind into the year but we've contemplated that. The other thing, just we did actually activate formally. We had talked about doing this but partially derisk transactional FX. But we are active with now cash flow hedges that gives us another lever just to help solidify that performance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I guess first two questions here. I wanted to focus on the guide change. And so I think China biosciences and pharma were the big reasons why you lowered the revenue guide this quarter. But it sounded like things were all on kind of track over the course of the quarter. So just curious like what changed, what kind of surprised you, when it happened. And I thought you didn't assume those markets to get better. So I was just kind of curious if there's -- are you changing your assumptions on when those things get better kind of going forward?\nTom Polen: Travis, this is Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, so as we mentioned before, we feel really good about the performance across the different businesses. Of course, mid-single-digit growth is a strong position, particularly given those dynamics that we see in those spaces. And even at flat essentially in BDB, that's differentiated versus what you're seeing competitively. I think what we're doing is just recognizing that we're not calling that those markets are going to turn in Q4, that we're going to continue to see some transitory dynamics in those spaces. We assume we're going to continue to compete and perform above market in those spaces which we've been doing all year. And so that's what we've built in here. The same dynamic a bit in China. I'd say China has played out as we look at Q3 and into Q4. So MDS, BDB playing out as we projected at the beginning of the year. no real change in that. I'd say in China, the two things are the bioscience dynamic is certainly noted in China. You're seeing that reported across essentially every peer where research spending is down in China, just given the economic macro environment. And so we're projecting that, that would continue. And then also as we see anticorruption in certain markets, one of the things that we see happen and we saw that in Q3 is that distributors, when there's uncertainty, they'll pull back on their inventory until they better understand it, right? So they won't let their inventory levels come down. We saw that play out a bit in Q3. We don't expect Q3 China performance to repeat in Q4. We do think there are some onetime dynamics there. But nevertheless, particularly on the bioscience side, we expect that dynamic to continue through the year. That's really it, Travis.\nTravis Steed: Okay. And then I guess the follow-up question is more into next year, kind of what kind of revenue growth do you need to kind of get to that double-digit reported EPS growth. Before you were kind of talking about BD at 5.5% plus, is that still possible if some of these headwinds that you're seeing this year, linger into next year? Just kind of doing the math this year, kind of ex-Alaris, looks like the growth is close to looking at 3.5% to 4%. I just wanted to see how to think about the next year revenue growth.\nTom Polen: We're not going to give revenue guidance on this call, Travis. But what I can do is maybe just share some color. Obviously, you're seeing us even in this environment which we do expect, particularly the Pharm Systems is probably easier to predict on recovery timing. Just given it's -- you can't destock forever, right? So that's pretty clear. Some of the life science research spending dynamics. If you think about a lot of pure players in those spaces are projecting recoveries later into -- early into '25. I think we'll hold to see that come up as we will give the next quarter to be able to observe that a little bit more before we give guidance on that space. But across all those spaces, we feel good. And while we're facing those exact transitory market dynamics, of course, you see us continue to deliver mid-single-digit growth this year, this quarter despite that environment. And I think we would expect, particularly those to only improve as we go into FY '25.\nChris DelOrefice: Travis, just maybe one other -- just 2 things. One, in my prepared remarks, I did say even in an environment where these dynamics continue, we're confident in delivering strong performance. we did that this quarter. This is still quality growth. I think just to put in context your Alaris comment, these transitory market dynamics, just those 2 areas alone are worth more than Alaris benefit, right? You've got high single-digit growth businesses that are nearly $4 billion, Pharm Systems used to be consistent double-digit grower. We're still seeing that strong biologics performance. That's a significant headwind we're absorbing. And to Tom's point, we're well outperforming those markets and so we continue to perform well there. And as those recover, those market trends are definitely long-term durable trends and we feel good about that. So I'd just add to consensus, what that means is -- the rest of our portfolio, look at -- BDI across the board was really strong, MDS performing well, specimen management performing, there is strong growth throughout our portfolio.\nTom Polen: Yes. Maybe just a couple of other bits of color is, as we look at kind of our core business, the durable portfolio is high-volume products. We're seeing really strong volume growth and share gain in areas like MDS, PAS, kind of the consumable side of MMS and we don't see a slowdown to that momentum; so we feel good on that. Certainly, as we think about our strategy in health care automation and AI informatics, now with Alaris back in our connected medication management portfolio, we're making really good progress. You heard us say we're already back -- Q3, we're back at the $100 million plus per quarter run rate that we had prior to Alaris going on ship hold. That's 3 to 6 months faster than we had expected going into the year. So we feel really good about that. And that momentum, we expect to continue basically from here on out. We're at that $100 million-plus run rate going forward and we've built a nice backlog of orders for Alaris. Remember, we started with zero backlog as we went into the year. We expect to exit this year at, again, a normalized backlog that we had pre-ship hold at least at that level. Other areas of that connected medication -- or the connected care health care automation portfolio we're really excited about for next year as well. Of course, that's our pharmacy automation strategy and our laboratory automation strategy there as well which continues to really resonate very well with customers. Products like PureWick that are targeting new care settings, we've got not only the new PureWick female launch happening but we also have the mobile PureWick launch happening next year which we're really excited about. And then in that chronic disease management space, you heard us talk about -- in Pharm Systems, double-digit biologics growth. We expect that to continue very strongly into '25. And then as destocking on the vaccine and the anti-coag side starts to alleviate, right, that will lift that whole boat. But we certainly don't expect any change in our underlying Biologics momentum there. Biosciences, maybe I can just give a little bit more color on that one, too, is I would say that we're at the point now where we're -- we've seen us be flat. The market has certainly been down. If you look at peers, I think almost every single peer is down in that space. We've been -- a bit of an outlier is being flat. We are seeing -- if we look at quarter-on-quarter instrument purchases, we're seeing them up a bit sequentially quarter-on-quarter. As we think about China in the future, there is discussion around China stimulus that's been widely discussed across the industry. I think the timing of that still needs a bit more clarity, certainly, sometime in '25, it's expected. But again, as we get into guidance and more specifics there on the November call. I would expect there'll probably be a bit more clarity on the timing of stimulus in China, too. But from a bioscience perspective, I think our assumptions now and what we're seeing, it's certainly not getting worse and we're seeing some green shoots of some positivity in some areas. Other signs that we see are people that even in the U.S. from an NIH perspective, folks that maybe were turned down initially for grants we're seeing on the second submissions, those grants starting to get approved and more POs then coming in for those instruments.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Roman: I wanted to ask one question on revenue then one on capital allocation. But maybe starting on the revenue side, appreciate some of the perspective around Alaris and the contribution that you expect that to drive this year than the sort of high-level perspective into next year. But how should we think about the growth drivers in that business beyond the bolus of performance you have from Alaris. I think you have a next-generation Pyxis platform launching. You have some of the pharmacy automation products starting to pick up steam. Maybe sort of contextualize the growth in that business beyond just the Alaris boost that we should see for the next 5 quarters?\nTom Polen: Yes. I'll start off, David, thanks for the question. This is Tom and then I'll turn it to Mike Garrison who we have here with us in the room. Really in MMS, I'd break it into kind of -- we've got 3 or 4 categories. One is the consumables space, let's just start off with that. We see really strong growth in overall procedure volumes driving strong growth in the consumables of IV sets, etcetera, that fit along with Alaris. So as you mentioned, Alaris is not only back to its historical run rate but we believe we took share in the quarter as we look at independent market data and as well as our own. So we feel really good about the position there. And then, of course, that starts pulling through other elements of our connected care portfolio, inclusive of interoperability, health site and other solutions. We do have the next-gen Pyxis launching in the back half of next year which we're excited about long term and Mike can comment on that. And then, of course, we have pharmacy automation, both in the U.S. and Europe and the overall trends there around pharmacy shortages, labor costs and big demands for productivity improvements which we are ideally suited to address and are by far the market leader in each of those spaces when it comes to those customer needs. So maybe, Mike, some more details on what we're seeing there.\nMike Garrison: Sure. So in addition to the next-gen Pyxis launch for next year, we've got about 10 additional releases across the connected med management portfolio that will come out. What we've implemented is a cadence of innovation. So whether it's in the core pharmacy, the acquisition of MedKeeper which is growing very nicely, some additions to that portfolio. Our MedBank acquisition which is going into long-term care settings and non-acute settings. These are some ways that, that entire market, we're starting to expand and go along with the shift of care into less acute environments or less hospital-based environments. But still, the hospital needing to stay connected from a data perspective, from an understanding of their total inventory perspective. So I think we're really well positioned from an innovation there. Growth in that market is cyclical. So it goes sort of with the book of business as capital would happen. But we do have a very strong service model there. And also, we offer a very flexible set of financing terms around capital and operating leases. So we're -- we have a little bit less cyclical nature than maybe some of the competitors that show a little bit more volatility in that area. Pharmacy automation between Parata and ROA and our RapidRx acquisition, we sort of built a fairly significant -- I think the largest pharmacy automation robotics company in the world. And the customer interest in that is very, very strong. It's been -- there's very high double-digit growth last year. A bit of change in tax incentives in Europe that we've commented on before that we've been watching, caused a little bit of a slowdown in Europe here this year but we've also started to see the order book pick up sequentially quarter-to-quarter, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So we feel good about that. The fundamentals there are very, very strong around labor efficiency, around safety, around the use of both artificial intelligence and robotics to provide additional efficiencies in health care, in the retail sector, in the long-term care sector and as hospitals start to reinvent their pharmacy. So I think in both areas, there are areas that augment and underscore -- while Alaris is obviously coming back very strong, it's just the 1-year anniversary on this call last year is where we announced that we had got clearance and that couldn't be going any better than the expectations than what it's going right now. But the fundamentals across that connected net management strategy are very strong and continue to resonate with the customers.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, David.\nDavid Roman: Sorry, I assume -- can I ask a follow-up here?\nTom Polen: Go ahead, David.\nDavid Roman: Sorry about that. Can you maybe just on the P&L comments for next year, one of the things that would be helpful to put together here is -- as you think about your growth rate, a lot of what you're describing here are macro factors and sort of end market dynamics which logically flow through to you given your high market share. But what can you do to differentially position BD from a performance perspective, especially given what looks to be like flattish operating expenses. So what are the sort of underlying assumptions around discretionary expense spending that are in that kind of 10% type earnings sort of floor that you've put out there for next year? And how should we think about the rest of the P&L below gross margin?\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, David. It's Chris. Yes, I think the exciting pivot is -- and think of Q3 as kind of an indicator of what' '25 would be, full year '25, based on the comments I shared. So we talked about exceeding now 25% operating margin in FY '25. So it implies north of 100 basis points of improvement. The significant majority of that is coming from gross margin. So you're seeing all the benefit of BD Excellence flow through which, to your point, creates an opportunity for us to kind of reshape below gross margin. The intent is to, as part of that 10% starting point, is to drive more investment in R&D and more investment in business building growth, digital capabilities, commercial go-to-market, etcetera. Our principle will always be to sort of get natural leverage from kind of our G&A space and we've also talked about that we're advancing a global business services model there as well. So that will be a minor catalyst in '25. The leverage will be there but it is also a go-forward catalyst. So that's how we think of the formula, more value out of gross margin. To your point, that lends itself nicely to the natural flow-through on sales and then reinvestment to support growth and leverage kind of your core infrastructure base.\nTom Polen: Yes. David, maybe just one other thing to add to Chris' good points there. And you heard us talk about this in the prepared remarks. BD Excellence which we really launched last year, we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum that we're getting there. So as you heard, we're up to over 500 Kaizen events this year. Of course, BD Excellence is based on Shingijutsu Kaizen which is the idea of the pursuit of excellence through continuous improvement and providing our organization with the tools, the systems, the capabilities to do that as part of their everyday work and then a series of major events like the 500-plus Kaizen that we mentioned where we immersed in that as an organization in specific areas. And we're really seeing that come through in reduced waste and improved line productivity. You're seeing that flow through also in our cash flow performance with exceptionally strong year-to-date as we're able to actually operate the company on a continued basis with less CapEx, just given the productivity improvements that we're seeing from that. At the same time, of course, Project RECODE which we folded up under our excellence initiative now which is the consolidation of over 20% of our manufacturing plants, right? That starts kicking in '25 as well which at a scale level. We got a bit of it in '24 but we really see that ramping up in '25 which further flywheels that margin. And then you also heard me mention that -- of course, as we now are consolidating plants, one of the things that happens as you end up with fewer larger plants. And as you're having fewer even larger plants, we're taking advantage of investing behind our smart factory strategy and those as well. We think -- as we think about technology, around AI, predictive analytics, companion robotics, etcetera, there's no company in med tech that's better positioned to be able to capitalize and get value out of that than BDS given the scale of production that we have. And so we've been digitizing. We have now quite a few areas that are fully paperless. So we're digitizing all the data coming off of our lines which has been allowing us to now start putting predictive analytics against those. As I mentioned, we've done that and with a focus on our top 30 plants where we're seeing accelerated performance from that. And so we're really combining that excellence Kaizen strategy with that smart factory strategy as well which is going to be continuing to drive at GP [ph] strategy of ours, not just in '25 but that's going to be a key theme as we look forward to Investor Day in Q2 of '25. Expect to hear more about that and our [indiscernible] margin focus over the next phase post-BD 2025.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.\nPatrick Wood: I'll keep it to one, just given the timing. And I appreciate you guys have covered this but I definitely want to dig into China a little bit more because you've had quite a few companies come out across a range of different industries and have a reasonable tough time in the market. So I guess, obviously, the VBP [ph] dynamics, we know there's biosciences on that side, as you said, lots of companies flagging on that. I guess my question is like what are you hearing from some of the customers? Have you seen any MDS vol changes outside of stocking? I'm just trying to dig into underlying in the market. Is there anything that you feel has structurally changed? Or are these genuinely transitory dynamics?\nTom Polen: Yes. Thanks, Patrick, for the question. So we've got a great team in China. We still view it as a large market with significant unmet needs and we continue to serve that market opportunity across the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to invest in advancing health care practices and access in China. As you mentioned, we see -- VBP [ph] has been playing out in MDS as expected. Just as a note there, our volumes in MDS China are actually up very nicely. So if you look at the -- even the categories where we're seeing VBP [ph], we see price pressure but we're seeing strong volume growth in those categories in MDS that are complementing that. So our plants are very busy in China because of higher volumes in those spaces. The lower research funding, as you mentioned, that's been broadly commented on across the board. And we do think there will be an end in sight to that as the market ultimately recovers and research investment. We don't see that as a long term, that China will be de-investing in research over the long term. We expect that will recover and that's more of a transitory dynamic. And then some of these other factors, they are related. There are economic challenges at a macro level happening in China, where I think that combines with the anticorruption and some of the actions that distributors take when there's uncertainty and they'll pause to pull inventories down a bit, those dynamics, I think, will evolve as just clarity in the economy and those processes end up coming into light. So -- which, again, we would expect to be more transitory in nature. So we continue to invest in the market. We still see it as a long-term attractive space, an important market for us. And we do have areas of the business that are continuing to do really well in China beyond some of those transitory spaces that we see. So maybe that's a high-level overview of what we see and as we look forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Two quick ones for me and I'll ask them both upfront. On Alaris, the $350 million in fiscal '24 sales implies about a $600 million annual run rate using the implied Q4 sales of about $150 million, if I'm doing the math right, is that the right way to think about fiscal '25 Alaris [ph] sales, about $600 million? And just lastly, Chris, the last two years, growth in margins have been very back-end weighted. And obviously, it's caused a lot of investor anxiety, is there any way or do you expect fiscal '25 to look different from a cadence standpoint?\nChris DelOrefice: Larry, thanks for the question. Yes, on the second question but we're still in our planning stance and we need to continue to monitor market dynamics, all these factors. I think the one thing is for sure that the margin rhythm is going to be much more balanced throughout. I mean last year, we had one a strategic choice on inventory takedown that was all front-end loaded, right? That was a predominant driver. The execution this year played out exactly as we talked about. As a matter of fact, the past few years, I mean we've executed against everything we said from a margin standpoint the past two years. So that's a big change. FX also was another big front-end item that we don't see that same degree. So I think naturally, we're going to end up with a much more balanced phasing and we'll share more when we provide our official guide in November. But I don't think that's an item that should be tough.\nTom Polen: But the other big thing that we had this year was, of course, Alaris was a ramp in the second half given that we just launched at the very end of Q4. So you're going to have much more ratable performance in Alaris Q1 through Q4 of next year as well. So we would expect much more smooth which we're very much looking forward to being back at that as we look forward. Just on Alaris, we're not certainly going to give guidance by any product line for '24; we're not at that point. I think that's -- I wouldn't take the run rate necessarily from that and take it through '25. But back to my commentary, we're back at, at least the $100 million historical run rate. Cannot [ph] be an opportunity to do better than that as we go into '25 for sure. And we'll give more color on that on the November call.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Maybe back to the fiscal '25 guide. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. It's been talked about several times but I just want to hear your language one more time. The 25% EPS growth commentary and the operating margin for over 25% clearly includes Critical Care, if I understand correctly. But to make sure it -- doesn't that sort of imply that everything else on a total basis is not going to grow as fast in fiscal '25 as it has in '24? And if I'm thinking about it remotely correctly, maybe I'm too deep into earnings season, I'm not thinking about it clearly. Are you -- does that imply you're being conservative or careful in this initial commentary? Just to make sure we're thinking about it correctly.\nChris DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. Yes. I mean, look, '25 is -- we think there's a lot to be excited about. Critical Care is part of it, to your point, that's not a substantive contributor just to be clear, the margin we're generating is fully on the BD base business. So we're well positioned there to now exceed the 25% operating margin goal. Again, importantly, the mix shifts significantly in terms of where margin improvement is coming from, it's coming from gross margin. Look, I think external estimates now are sitting actually just under 9%, right? We see that to the low end of our range, 10% reported is a great starting point, above where we are externally. And like we do every year is, our goal is to continue to create opportunity to exceed that as we move throughout the year; so it's early. We just knew it was important to kind of share context and we've been able to do this, by the way, this year, like on the top line, the questions, deliver strong performance despite these market dynamics. So we'll continue to monitor those but feel really good about how we're positioned moving into 2025.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Just one for me. Some of these issues you have mentioned, right, I think on the pharma side, some of your close peers are talking about a bottoming on destocking. So just maybe from your perspective, like how are you seeing this destocking impact playing out. And when I look at those moving transitory sort of issues, like China, bioscience and pharma destocking, it looks like biosciences should -- certainly headwind should continue. I think most of tools companies have been cautious about first half of '25. How should we think about China? Is that should that get back to growth? Or is this VBP [ph] headwinds, could that last for a while?\nTom Polen: Yes, it's a great question, Vijay. So let me start with maybe the bioscience and then touch base on Pharm Systems and then touch base on China. So on Pharm Systems -- or on biosciences, I think, as you mentioned, it's been widely commented on across the tools companies. Again, we see ourselves outperforming the market this year. That's pretty straightforward. There's very few that are flat like we are in that space. And you heard us make -- share in our prepared remarks some of the really exciting innovations that we see driving that. And not only are they driving that in this environment, as the market ultimately recovers, those same technologies around FACSDiscover and the continued cadence of new innovations not only with sorters but next year, launching our first analyzer in that segment, continued innovation with dies and other technologies that are allowing more and more multiplexing in that category are all just going to benefit us as that market picks up and people can begin to buy systems in larger volumes. So we feel good about that. And it really comes down to the timing of the recovery which, as you mentioned, we're assuming it's going to continue to be tight through the balance of this year which is how we've updated our guidance. And then we would expect at some point in '25, again, let's watch Q4, we'll update '25 guidance in November on that. I think we'll benefit from that timing to get clarity as with the whole market. On Pharm Systems, look, we continue to see that strong demand on biologics underlying which is also differentiated versus peers, double-digit growth again in biologics within that space. We see no slowdown there. Obviously, GLP-1s are a big component of that and our position that we have on some of the large current market molecules is benefiting us. We also shared we've got a position with a number of new GLP-1s that are moving through the pipeline towards launch are already having our device spec-ed in. And then we also see -- we have over 40 signed agreements for biosimilar GLP-1s, the early molecules of GLP-1s that we start seeing launch as early as the next 12 months there and that will play out over the longer term as those play out. But we really like our position there. Of course, the destocking that's happening that, as you mentioned, everyone is seeing across that the sector, has really been focused on the anticoagulant and vaccine segment for us. And I think broadly for others and that can't continue forever. So we would expect that as we move into FY '25 and again, we'll give more specifics on timing as we go into guidance. But certainly, as we go to the back half of that, we would expect that to be -- start coming, returning to more normalized growth. On China, look, we have China -- we don't have -- as we think about the numbers that we've shared around double-digit EPS growth for next year, we don't have a major assumption of China returning back to high growth next year in that. We've taken a conservative position in our internal monitoring -- modeling on that. And we'll continue to watch that market play out as we go forward but we've taken a conservative stance on our own internal modeling there as we look at and build our plan for the 10% EPS growth number. So we still see -- and again, that will be related to the biopharma research spending that's happening in China will be something we'll continue to watch closely and how that overall macro recovery -- market recovers, we'll continue to watch the China macroeconomic environment overall. We do see MDS. We don't see a change in terms of the timing of VBP [ph] starting to decline. We've seen that play out this year as we expected. We don't expect that to be as significant next year for MDS, just given the scale that happened this year. I think we've said that in the past, we don't expect that to change, i.e., we see less pressure in MDS next year in China from VBP [ph] but more to come on China as we give guidance. But hopefully, that just gives some color on China and what we've built into some of our preliminary thinking as we shared the number on EPS for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for any additional or closing remarks.\nTom Polen: Okay. Thank you, operator and thank you to all of our investors for joining us on our call today. We are pleased to deliver strong, above-market, broad-based growth and are well positioned to achieve our increased FY '24 earnings guidance. As we look ahead to FY '25, we are excited by multiple growth opportunities across our portfolio, momentum in BD Excellence, driving continued strength in gross margins and cash flow and welcoming the Critical Care team to BD. We look forward to connecting with everyone again in November and thank you for your continued support of BD. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude this audio webcast. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Mike Garrison",
            "content": "Sure. So in addition to the next-gen Pyxis launch for next year, we've got about 10 additional releases across the connected med management portfolio that will come out. What we've implemented is a cadence of innovation. So whether it's in the core pharmacy, the acquisition of MedKeeper which is growing very nicely, some additions to that portfolio. Our MedBank acquisition which is going into long-term care settings and non-acute settings. These are some ways that, that entire market, we're starting to expand and go along with the shift of care into less acute environments or less hospital-based environments. But still, the hospital needing to stay connected from a data perspective, from an understanding of their total inventory perspective. So I think we're really well positioned from an innovation there. Growth in that market is cyclical. So it goes sort of with the book of business as capital would happen. But we do have a very strong service model there. And also, we offer a very flexible set of financing terms around capital and operating leases. So we're -- we have a little bit less cyclical nature than maybe some of the competitors that show a little bit more volatility in that area. Pharmacy automation between Parata and ROA and our RapidRx acquisition, we sort of built a fairly significant -- I think the largest pharmacy automation robotics company in the world. And the customer interest in that is very, very strong. It's been -- there's very high double-digit growth last year. A bit of change in tax incentives in Europe that we've commented on before that we've been watching, caused a little bit of a slowdown in Europe here this year but we've also started to see the order book pick up sequentially quarter-to-quarter, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So we feel good about that. The fundamentals there are very, very strong around labor efficiency, around safety, around the use of both artificial intelligence and robotics to provide additional efficiencies in health care, in the retail sector, in the long-term care sector and as hospitals start to reinvent their pharmacy. So I think in both areas, there are areas that augment and underscore -- while Alaris is obviously coming back very strong, it's just the 1-year anniversary on this call last year is where we announced that we had got clearance and that couldn't be going any better than the expectations than what it's going right now. But the fundamentals across that connected net management strategy are very strong and continue to resonate with the customers."

            "name": "Tom Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress advancing our BD 2025 strategy. This quarter demonstrates the durability of our portfolio and strength of new innovations, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth of 5.2%. Growth was broad-based and reflects strong volume and share gains across the portfolio. Our team executed very well through transitory market dynamics in BDB and PS [ph] and macro factors in China. We continue to grow above the market and believe we are extremely well positioned as these markets recover. We have growing momentum from our BD Excellence operating system that enabled us to deliver significant sequential and year-over-year adjusted gross margin increases. This drove strong operating margin expansion contributed to over 18% adjusted earnings per share growth and is allowing us to raise our earnings guidance once again. Our team's excellent execution also drove over 100% year-to-date growth in free cash flow, reaching over 80% free cash flow conversion year-to-date, with margins, earnings and cash flow all ahead of plan. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: driving growth through innovation and tuck-in M&A, simplifying through BD Excellence and empowering our organization with the capabilities and systems to deliver on our strategy. I'd like to provide updates on each of these this morning. Starting with our growth pillar and the Critical Care acquisition. Things continue to progress well towards a successful close and as we've gotten to know more members of their team, we only become more excited to welcome them to the BD family. Critical Care significantly advances our connected care strategy to use AI and digital tools to help clinicians deliver more efficient and higher quality care. Additionally, it adds a high-growth business that is immediately accretive to margins and earnings. Turning to several of our most significant long-term growth drivers. To begin with, our connected medication management strategy has strong momentum, with Q3 setting another new all-time record for the number of Alaris pumps shipped in a quarter. The scale of upgrading our fleet is unprecedented and I'm very proud of the work our teams are doing to support our loyal customer base and deliver ahead of our commitments. Customer feedback has been very positive and we gained a market position in the quarter. We are now back at our historical quarterly run rate of about $100 million and have built a healthy committed contract backlog which puts us in a position to be above our historical run rate for FY '25. Our connected medication management portfolio which includes Alaris, is just one example of how BD is at the forefront of combining AI, automation and robotics to improve the core processes that run health care. Through our strategy, BD is advancing our leadership in automating the pharmacy, the medication management process and the microbiology lab. Today, BD has a $4 billion-plus business in health care automation and informatics AI and we'll increase this to over $5 billion as we complete the acquisition of Critical Care. This expands BD in the smart critical care space and creates new opportunities to combine AI-driven monitoring with systems such as infusion technologies to simplify nursing workflow and improve patient care. Looking ahead to 2030, we view health care process automation and informatics AI as having the potential to become a business exceeding $7 billion as we continue to build more connected, automated and intelligent solutions to transform the core processes underlying care delivery. Turning to other key platforms. Q3 was the 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our PureWick platform. In our recently launched next-generation female external catheter, PureWick Flex, is expected to support this continued momentum. PureWick Flex delivers improved performance for a wider range of body types, both in acute and home care settings. Given the incredible response from the first PureWick Flex users, we couldn't be more excited about the impact this will have on patients and their providers. As I think about PureWick overall, we see this as having the potential to become a $1 billion franchise by 2030, continuing its double-digit growth momentum. We're also advancing our impact in immune health in oncology, continuing the super cycle of innovation within BD Biosciences which positions it well as a long-term growth driver. Coming off the landmark BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter launch in FY '23, we recently released additional 3 and 4 laser configurations which contain the same new-to-world BD SpectralFX and BD CellView technologies, enabling new discoveries in a broader range of fields. We expect to continue our innovation cadence with our FY '25 launch of the BD FACSDiscover A8 Analyzer which will provide customers high-throughput sample analysis with the same innovative technologies. The combination of BD FACSDiscover and our BD RealBlue and RealYellow reagents were used in the world's first 50 color flow cytometry experiment which was published this year in the Journal of Cytometry. This serves as a testament to these ground-breaking new technologies. The immune health and oncology space remains a primary focus for research and as the market returns to growth, we believe a leading technology and portfolio position us well to capitalize on future opportunities in this space. Finally, within our Pharmaceutical Systems business, in Q3, biologics drug delivery continued to grow double digits. Biologics now represent over 40% of our total Pharmaceutical Systems revenue and we see it as a significant growth opportunity, including GLP-1s. Since the start of BD 2025, we've been implementing a strategy to enhance our innovation leadership, expand our manufacturing scale and prioritize quality excellence to be the preferred partner for biologic drug delivery. And we believe that no other company in med tech is better positioned than BD to capitalize on this trend. First, the majority of biologics that use a prefilled syringe have and continue to be launched in the BD device. Since 2023, BD has been the chosen partner for 19 out of the 23 new biologic drug approvals that use a prefilled syringe. Second, as we consider the significant clinical potentials of GLP-1s, the strength of BD's innovation in this category and our previously announced capacity expansion, we view GLP-1 drug delivery as a potential $1 billion product category by 2030. Today, we serve multiple market leaders, have device contracts with multiple novel GLP-1 therapies advancing through clinical trials and beyond novel molecules, we now have over 40 signed GLP-1 biosimilar agreements across our pen [ph], auto-injector and syringe platforms. We are actively supporting biosimilars for early generation GLP-1s that are entering the market over the next 12 months. Outside of GLP-1s, our customers are working to develop next-generation biologics that have the potential to revolutionize care and conditions like Alzheimer's, certain immunological disorders and types of cancer. Many of these are extremely complex molecules and proteins that will involve significantly greater volumes for injection and higher viscosity compared to therapies presently available in the market. At the same time, we see the trends to enable patient self-treatment that point to the need for wearable on-body injectors. We've developed the BD Libertas and BD Evolve wearable injectors to support the unique delivery needs of these therapies. We're actively supporting multiple customers testing their pipeline molecules with our wearable solutions and have provided product to support their clinical trials. While this is a longer-term opportunity that we expect to develop in line with drug development time lines, we believe we are well positioned for this future trend and are getting very positive feedback on our platforms. Moving to our simplification strategy and BD Excellence. First, let me express my gratitude to everyone in our organization who is accelerating BD Excellence through our global supply chain, through the completion of over 500 Kaizen events this year. I especially like to thank those working in our manufacturing plants and warehouses to improve product quality and reliability for our customers this year while delivering double-digit improvements in both waste reduction and production yield. We are seeing the outcomes of BD Excellence in accelerating margin progression and delivering strong cash flow. Our plans to reduce our manufacturing network by over 20% remain on track. And as we are consolidating our plant architecture, we're investing in smart factories. Our top 30 sites are already accelerating performance, leveraging smart automation and digital capabilities such as predictive analytics. We're excited about the opportunity to further accelerate manufacturing productivity through the combination of BD Excellence and our smart factory strategy. The momentum in our simplification programs, including BD Excellence, positions us for success as we finish FY '24 and as we look ahead to FY '25 and beyond. Lastly, we continue to empower our organization through strong corporate responsibility and recently issued our FY '23 Corporate Sustainability Report. Notably, in FY '23, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, 18% versus our FY '19 baseline, surpassing our goal of 13%. We doubled the number of sites using green electric power and solar power and we reduced our water usage by 21% and waste by 18% over the same time frame. In summary, we delivered above-market mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and significant margin expansion and cash flow generation. On the strength in the quarter, we are once again raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned for continued strong financial performance next year. We have leadership positions in many of the most significant trends reshaping health care, positioning us well in FY '25 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. Robbie, thanks for the question. This is Tom. I'll start off and then turn it over to Chris. I think as we look at Q3, first off, we're really pleased with strong performance across many areas of almost every area of the company, particularly as we look at compared to market, where we saw strong share gains in a number of areas. We saw a strong volume performance. And even in markets that are undergoing transitory market dynamics, specifically the BDB research market environment and the destocking in Pharm systems. As we look at our performance, I really like our competitive position in those spaces. You're seeing us outperform what's been announced by others to date. And so as those markets ultimately rebound and you heard us talk about some of the new innovations in BDB. Obviously, our position in biologics and the differentiated growth that we're getting there. And the differentiated share gains that we're getting there in terms of our share of new molecules and even biosimilar spaces. We really like our position there long term. So I think that's really -- as we think about Q3, those dynamics in those spaces as well as just the continued play out in China is what we saw. I'll turn it to Chris, just to talk a little bit more about how we think about guidance in Q4. Pretty straightforward. Travis, this is Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, so as we mentioned before, we feel really good about the performance across the different businesses. Of course, mid-single-digit growth is a strong position, particularly given those dynamics that we see in those spaces. And even at flat essentially in BDB, that's differentiated versus what you're seeing competitively. I think what we're doing is just recognizing that we're not calling that those markets are going to turn in Q4, that we're going to continue to see some transitory dynamics in those spaces. We assume we're going to continue to compete and perform above market in those spaces which we've been doing all year. And so that's what we've built in here. The same dynamic a bit in China. I'd say China has played out as we look at Q3 and into Q4. So MDS, BDB playing out as we projected at the beginning of the year. no real change in that. I'd say in China, the two things are the bioscience dynamic is certainly noted in China. You're seeing that reported across essentially every peer where research spending is down in China, just given the economic macro environment. And so we're projecting that, that would continue. And then also as we see anticorruption in certain markets, one of the things that we see happen and we saw that in Q3 is that distributors, when there's uncertainty, they'll pull back on their inventory until they better understand it, right? So they won't let their inventory levels come down. We saw that play out a bit in Q3. We don't expect Q3 China performance to repeat in Q4. We do think there are some onetime dynamics there. But nevertheless, particularly on the bioscience side, we expect that dynamic to continue through the year. That's really it, Travis. We're not going to give revenue guidance on this call, Travis. But what I can do is maybe just share some color. Obviously, you're seeing us even in this environment which we do expect, particularly the Pharm Systems is probably easier to predict on recovery timing. Just given it's -- you can't destock forever, right? So that's pretty clear. Some of the life science research spending dynamics. If you think about a lot of pure players in those spaces are projecting recoveries later into -- early into '25. I think we'll hold to see that come up as we will give the next quarter to be able to observe that a little bit more before we give guidance on that space. But across all those spaces, we feel good. And while we're facing those exact transitory market dynamics, of course, you see us continue to deliver mid-single-digit growth this year, this quarter despite that environment. And I think we would expect, particularly those to only improve as we go into FY '25. Yes. Maybe just a couple of other bits of color is, as we look at kind of our core business, the durable portfolio is high-volume products. We're seeing really strong volume growth and share gain in areas like MDS, PAS, kind of the consumable side of MMS and we don't see a slowdown to that momentum; so we feel good on that. Certainly, as we think about our strategy in health care automation and AI informatics, now with Alaris back in our connected medication management portfolio, we're making really good progress. You heard us say we're already back -- Q3, we're back at the $100 million plus per quarter run rate that we had prior to Alaris going on ship hold. That's 3 to 6 months faster than we had expected going into the year. So we feel really good about that. And that momentum, we expect to continue basically from here on out. We're at that $100 million-plus run rate going forward and we've built a nice backlog of orders for Alaris. Remember, we started with zero backlog as we went into the year. We expect to exit this year at, again, a normalized backlog that we had pre-ship hold at least at that level. Other areas of that connected medication -- or the connected care health care automation portfolio we're really excited about for next year as well. Of course, that's our pharmacy automation strategy and our laboratory automation strategy there as well which continues to really resonate very well with customers. Products like PureWick that are targeting new care settings, we've got not only the new PureWick female launch happening but we also have the mobile PureWick launch happening next year which we're really excited about. And then in that chronic disease management space, you heard us talk about -- in Pharm Systems, double-digit biologics growth. We expect that to continue very strongly into '25. And then as destocking on the vaccine and the anti-coag side starts to alleviate, right, that will lift that whole boat. But we certainly don't expect any change in our underlying Biologics momentum there. Biosciences, maybe I can just give a little bit more color on that one, too, is I would say that we're at the point now where we're -- we've seen us be flat. The market has certainly been down. If you look at peers, I think almost every single peer is down in that space. We've been -- a bit of an outlier is being flat. We are seeing -- if we look at quarter-on-quarter instrument purchases, we're seeing them up a bit sequentially quarter-on-quarter. As we think about China in the future, there is discussion around China stimulus that's been widely discussed across the industry. I think the timing of that still needs a bit more clarity, certainly, sometime in '25, it's expected. But again, as we get into guidance and more specifics there on the November call. I would expect there'll probably be a bit more clarity on the timing of stimulus in China, too. But from a bioscience perspective, I think our assumptions now and what we're seeing, it's certainly not getting worse and we're seeing some green shoots of some positivity in some areas. Other signs that we see are people that even in the U.S. from an NIH perspective, folks that maybe were turned down initially for grants we're seeing on the second submissions, those grants starting to get approved and more POs then coming in for those instruments. Yes. I'll start off, David, thanks for the question. This is Tom and then I'll turn it to Mike Garrison who we have here with us in the room. Really in MMS, I'd break it into kind of -- we've got 3 or 4 categories. One is the consumables space, let's just start off with that. We see really strong growth in overall procedure volumes driving strong growth in the consumables of IV sets, etcetera, that fit along with Alaris. So as you mentioned, Alaris is not only back to its historical run rate but we believe we took share in the quarter as we look at independent market data and as well as our own. So we feel really good about the position there. And then, of course, that starts pulling through other elements of our connected care portfolio, inclusive of interoperability, health site and other solutions. We do have the next-gen Pyxis launching in the back half of next year which we're excited about long term and Mike can comment on that. And then, of course, we have pharmacy automation, both in the U.S. and Europe and the overall trends there around pharmacy shortages, labor costs and big demands for productivity improvements which we are ideally suited to address and are by far the market leader in each of those spaces when it comes to those customer needs. So maybe, Mike, some more details on what we're seeing there. Thanks for the question, David. Go ahead, David. Yes. David, maybe just one other thing to add to Chris' good points there. And you heard us talk about this in the prepared remarks. BD Excellence which we really launched last year, we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum that we're getting there. So as you heard, we're up to over 500 Kaizen events this year. Of course, BD Excellence is based on Shingijutsu Kaizen which is the idea of the pursuit of excellence through continuous improvement and providing our organization with the tools, the systems, the capabilities to do that as part of their everyday work and then a series of major events like the 500-plus Kaizen that we mentioned where we immersed in that as an organization in specific areas. And we're really seeing that come through in reduced waste and improved line productivity. You're seeing that flow through also in our cash flow performance with exceptionally strong year-to-date as we're able to actually operate the company on a continued basis with less CapEx, just given the productivity improvements that we're seeing from that. At the same time, of course, Project RECODE which we folded up under our excellence initiative now which is the consolidation of over 20% of our manufacturing plants, right? That starts kicking in '25 as well which at a scale level. We got a bit of it in '24 but we really see that ramping up in '25 which further flywheels that margin. And then you also heard me mention that -- of course, as we now are consolidating plants, one of the things that happens as you end up with fewer larger plants. And as you're having fewer even larger plants, we're taking advantage of investing behind our smart factory strategy and those as well. We think -- as we think about technology, around AI, predictive analytics, companion robotics, etcetera, there's no company in med tech that's better positioned to be able to capitalize and get value out of that than BDS given the scale of production that we have. And so we've been digitizing. We have now quite a few areas that are fully paperless. So we're digitizing all the data coming off of our lines which has been allowing us to now start putting predictive analytics against those. As I mentioned, we've done that and with a focus on our top 30 plants where we're seeing accelerated performance from that. And so we're really combining that excellence Kaizen strategy with that smart factory strategy as well which is going to be continuing to drive at GP [ph] strategy of ours, not just in '25 but that's going to be a key theme as we look forward to Investor Day in Q2 of '25. Expect to hear more about that and our [indiscernible] margin focus over the next phase post-BD 2025. Yes. Thanks, Patrick, for the question. So we've got a great team in China. We still view it as a large market with significant unmet needs and we continue to serve that market opportunity across the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to invest in advancing health care practices and access in China. As you mentioned, we see -- VBP [ph] has been playing out in MDS as expected. Just as a note there, our volumes in MDS China are actually up very nicely. So if you look at the -- even the categories where we're seeing VBP [ph], we see price pressure but we're seeing strong volume growth in those categories in MDS that are complementing that. So our plants are very busy in China because of higher volumes in those spaces. The lower research funding, as you mentioned, that's been broadly commented on across the board. And we do think there will be an end in sight to that as the market ultimately recovers and research investment. We don't see that as a long term, that China will be de-investing in research over the long term. We expect that will recover and that's more of a transitory dynamic. And then some of these other factors, they are related. There are economic challenges at a macro level happening in China, where I think that combines with the anticorruption and some of the actions that distributors take when there's uncertainty and they'll pause to pull inventories down a bit, those dynamics, I think, will evolve as just clarity in the economy and those processes end up coming into light. So -- which, again, we would expect to be more transitory in nature. So we continue to invest in the market. We still see it as a long-term attractive space, an important market for us. And we do have areas of the business that are continuing to do really well in China beyond some of those transitory spaces that we see. So maybe that's a high-level overview of what we see and as we look forward. But the other big thing that we had this year was, of course, Alaris was a ramp in the second half given that we just launched at the very end of Q4. So you're going to have much more ratable performance in Alaris Q1 through Q4 of next year as well. So we would expect much more smooth which we're very much looking forward to being back at that as we look forward. Just on Alaris, we're not certainly going to give guidance by any product line for '24; we're not at that point. I think that's -- I wouldn't take the run rate necessarily from that and take it through '25. But back to my commentary, we're back at, at least the $100 million historical run rate. Cannot [ph] be an opportunity to do better than that as we go into '25 for sure. And we'll give more color on that on the November call. Yes, it's a great question, Vijay. So let me start with maybe the bioscience and then touch base on Pharm Systems and then touch base on China. So on Pharm Systems -- or on biosciences, I think, as you mentioned, it's been widely commented on across the tools companies. Again, we see ourselves outperforming the market this year. That's pretty straightforward. There's very few that are flat like we are in that space. And you heard us make -- share in our prepared remarks some of the really exciting innovations that we see driving that. And not only are they driving that in this environment, as the market ultimately recovers, those same technologies around FACSDiscover and the continued cadence of new innovations not only with sorters but next year, launching our first analyzer in that segment, continued innovation with dies and other technologies that are allowing more and more multiplexing in that category are all just going to benefit us as that market picks up and people can begin to buy systems in larger volumes. So we feel good about that. And it really comes down to the timing of the recovery which, as you mentioned, we're assuming it's going to continue to be tight through the balance of this year which is how we've updated our guidance. And then we would expect at some point in '25, again, let's watch Q4, we'll update '25 guidance in November on that. I think we'll benefit from that timing to get clarity as with the whole market. On Pharm Systems, look, we continue to see that strong demand on biologics underlying which is also differentiated versus peers, double-digit growth again in biologics within that space. We see no slowdown there. Obviously, GLP-1s are a big component of that and our position that we have on some of the large current market molecules is benefiting us. We also shared we've got a position with a number of new GLP-1s that are moving through the pipeline towards launch are already having our device spec-ed in. And then we also see -- we have over 40 signed agreements for biosimilar GLP-1s, the early molecules of GLP-1s that we start seeing launch as early as the next 12 months there and that will play out over the longer term as those play out. But we really like our position there. Of course, the destocking that's happening that, as you mentioned, everyone is seeing across that the sector, has really been focused on the anticoagulant and vaccine segment for us. And I think broadly for others and that can't continue forever. So we would expect that as we move into FY '25 and again, we'll give more specifics on timing as we go into guidance. But certainly, as we go to the back half of that, we would expect that to be -- start coming, returning to more normalized growth. On China, look, we have China -- we don't have -- as we think about the numbers that we've shared around double-digit EPS growth for next year, we don't have a major assumption of China returning back to high growth next year in that. We've taken a conservative position in our internal monitoring -- modeling on that. And we'll continue to watch that market play out as we go forward but we've taken a conservative stance on our own internal modeling there as we look at and build our plan for the 10% EPS growth number. So we still see -- and again, that will be related to the biopharma research spending that's happening in China will be something we'll continue to watch closely and how that overall macro recovery -- market recovers, we'll continue to watch the China macroeconomic environment overall. We do see MDS. We don't see a change in terms of the timing of VBP [ph] starting to decline. We've seen that play out this year as we expected. We don't expect that to be as significant next year for MDS, just given the scale that happened this year. I think we've said that in the past, we don't expect that to change, i.e., we see less pressure in MDS next year in China from VBP [ph] but more to come on China as we give guidance. But hopefully, that just gives some color on China and what we've built into some of our preliminary thinking as we shared the number on EPS for next year. Okay. Thank you, operator and thank you to all of our investors for joining us on our call today. We are pleased to deliver strong, above-market, broad-based growth and are well positioned to achieve our increased FY '24 earnings guidance. As we look ahead to FY '25, we are excited by multiple growth opportunities across our portfolio, momentum in BD Excellence, driving continued strength in gross margins and cash flow and welcoming the Critical Care team to BD. We look forward to connecting with everyone again in November and thank you for your continued support of BD. Thank you, operator."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, the quarter's results reflect strong performance across multiple parts of our portfolio, even amid the previously noted transitory market dynamics and macro factors. Importantly, with strong execution of our BD Excellence programs, we exceeded our margin, earnings and cash flow goals. I'll now provide some further insight into our adjusted revenue performance. Q3 revenue grew 5.2% organic, driven by volume growth and share gains. Regionally, over 90% of our revenue which includes our 3 largest geographies, grew 6% plus organic. This strong performance was partially offset by a decrease in China from continued market dynamics. BD Medical growth was led by MMS with exceptional performance in infusion systems, driven by the BD Alaris return to market and higher utilization of infusion sets, partially offset by a tough prior year comparison in dispensing. Broad volume growth and share gains across our MDS consumable portfolio in developed markets also contributed to the segment's growth. Pharm Systems had another quarter of increasing demand with double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologic drugs, primarily GLP-1s. This growth was offset by transitory market dynamics across the industry, including expected customer inventory destocking. BD Life Sciences performance was led by IDS with high single-digit growth in specimen management which reflects both increased utilization and customer upgrades to higher-value products to provide an enhanced patient experience. The segment's growth was partially offset by transitory market dynamics in biosciences that resulted in lower market demand for instruments. Given our leading portfolio in instruments and reagents, we significantly outperformed the category in the quarter. Strong organic growth in BD Interventional was led by high single-digit growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Surgery delivered another strong quarter across all 3 major platforms with double-digit organic growth across advanced repair and reconstruction, infection prevention and biosurgery. We continue to make excellent progress with conversion to our bioresorbable Phasix technology which we see as a durable contributor to future growth. BDI performance was also supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease that was partially offset by a decrease in oncology, driven primarily by market dynamics in China. Now moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential and year-over-year margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 54.3% and adjusted operating margin of 25.2%, both above our expectations. The gross margin year-over-year increase of 170 basis points was primarily driven by increased productivity and cost improvement from our BD Excellence initiatives and moderating inflation. Our operating margin increased by 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by the increase in gross margin and healthy operating expense leverage with expenses increasing slightly on a dollar basis year-over-year. As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q3 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50 which grew double digits or 18.2% on a reported basis. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, I'm really pleased with our strategic choices and the execution on cash flow. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow increased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $2.2 billion reflecting continued improvement in working capital, including continued inventory optimization, planned phasing certain cash flow items and the ability to leverage our capital expenditures as we benefit from BD Excellence productivity gains. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in fiscal year '24, with our year-to-date free cash flow conversion above 80% and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals. Net leverage improved to 2.4x and cash and short-term investments totaled $5.3 billion, inclusive of about $3.4 billion in proceeds from the February debt refinancing and the Critical Care acquisition financing in June. Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead, we are confident in a strong close to fiscal year '24. We remain focused on driving multiple areas of momentum and share gains across our portfolio, including Alaris. For the full year, even with this broad-based momentum, it is prudent for us to reflect the latest market dynamics which others are also experiencing. As a result, we now expect organic revenue growth to be 5% to 5.25% for the full year. Based on the strength of our margin performance, we were able to absorb the revised organic revenue growth guidance and are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $13.05 to $13.15 on a reported basis. This reflects an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint and $0.10 at the bottom of the range. We believe we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of over 50 basis points improvement which implies full year adjusted operating margins of over 24%. We continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD Excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on our expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25. While it's too early to provide guidance as we are in our planning process, I can offer the following thoughts. We are continuing to monitor dynamics in select markets. Even in an environment where these dynamics continue to exist, we are confident in delivering strong performance, particularly our ability to exceed our 25% adjusted operating margin goal and deliver double-digit EPS growth, given the increasing benefit to gross margin from accelerating BD Excellence momentum. We think 10% EPS growth would be a good starting point for fiscal year '25, including Critical Care and the expected impact of Pillar 2. So in summary, based on the durability of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we are confident in delivering another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported overdelivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter Q4, we are on track to exceed our full year margin improvement goals, deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth and once again increase our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD 2025 value creation objectives. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue? Yes. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Robbie, for the question. Yes, Q4 is actually pretty straightforward. So to your point on the top line revenue organic it implies upper 6% range, consistent with what you shared, maybe a little north of that. It's really attributed to one key dynamic. It's the continued momentum of Alaris. By the way, we obviously have a much stronger line of sight based on our committed contract position. This is the strongest quarter that we have this year as it relates to line of sight of that because now we're 3 quarters in that. In addition to that, if you recall, last year in Q4, we have a favorable comp in Alaris as well because we had stopped shipping under medical necessity, as we got the approval and we're preparing for launch. So you actually have a favorable comp and you have continued momentum with Alaris which as you saw was very positive in the quarter. The rest of the portfolio, we actually assume similar performance. So we're not making assumptions of significant market recovery or things of that. We're going to continue to outperform in those spaces from a relative standpoint. So I feel good about revenue. Margin, hopefully, everyone had an opportunity to see, Q3 was really strong. We outperformed margin. It led to the outperformance on EPS. The story there is straightforward. Gross margin, it basically just have to repeat Q3 which is already flowing through our cost base, right? We're in our cap and roll period there. So there's not a substantive change in terms of gross margin. On operating margin, the gross margin will flow through. We're actually increasing expenses slightly from an OpEx standpoint where you end up with that, call it, high 6% growth. You get a little bit of a natural leverage there that will flow through and we feel really good about that. I think importantly and we can talk more about this, pretends well for '25 as we think of margins. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes. Look, we're excited about '25. It's setting up nicely to deliver strong performance. First, top line, I'll just reiterate, we're extremely pleased. Our strategy is paying off in terms of strength of portfolio. Continue to focus on driving volume and share gains. And what you're really seeing in this quarter is the ability to deliver strong performance despite these market dynamics, most notably BDB, Pharm Systems and as Tom noted, China. So we're not dependent on one thing. The durability of our portfolio sets us up nicely. And then from a margin standpoint, I shared that on the momentum we have this year, we expect to now exceed 25%. I think importantly, what you'll see different in '25 going forward is the significant majority of that will come from gross margin. And actually, if you look at where we are in the back half of the year, you can kind of think of Q3 as sort of a nice number directionally to think of '25 and carrying that through. So I feel very good about line of sight to margin. As you noted, we're excited about Critical Care. It just gives us another positive catalyst to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth. We are contemplating headwinds from Pillar 2. So still more to come on that. It's premature to share specifics but we do anticipate that's a headwind that we will absorb as part of that. And so all that collectively sets us up nicely, to your point, I think what I see externally where the Street is, we would see that more in the low end of the range and it would be 10% and that is on a reported basis. So FX at this point, there's a modest headwind into the year but we've contemplated that. The other thing, just we did actually activate formally. We had talked about doing this but partially derisk transactional FX. But we are active with now cash flow hedges that gives us another lever just to help solidify that performance. Travis, just maybe one other -- just 2 things. One, in my prepared remarks, I did say even in an environment where these dynamics continue, we're confident in delivering strong performance. we did that this quarter. This is still quality growth. I think just to put in context your Alaris comment, these transitory market dynamics, just those 2 areas alone are worth more than Alaris benefit, right? You've got high single-digit growth businesses that are nearly $4 billion, Pharm Systems used to be consistent double-digit grower. We're still seeing that strong biologics performance. That's a significant headwind we're absorbing. And to Tom's point, we're well outperforming those markets and so we continue to perform well there. And as those recover, those market trends are definitely long-term durable trends and we feel good about that. So I'd just add to consensus, what that means is -- the rest of our portfolio, look at -- BDI across the board was really strong, MDS performing well, specimen management performing, there is strong growth throughout our portfolio. Yes. Thanks, David. It's Chris. Yes, I think the exciting pivot is -- and think of Q3 as kind of an indicator of what' '25 would be, full year '25, based on the comments I shared. So we talked about exceeding now 25% operating margin in FY '25. So it implies north of 100 basis points of improvement. The significant majority of that is coming from gross margin. So you're seeing all the benefit of BD Excellence flow through which, to your point, creates an opportunity for us to kind of reshape below gross margin. The intent is to, as part of that 10% starting point, is to drive more investment in R&D and more investment in business building growth, digital capabilities, commercial go-to-market, etcetera. Our principle will always be to sort of get natural leverage from kind of our G&A space and we've also talked about that we're advancing a global business services model there as well. So that will be a minor catalyst in '25. The leverage will be there but it is also a go-forward catalyst. So that's how we think of the formula, more value out of gross margin. To your point, that lends itself nicely to the natural flow-through on sales and then reinvestment to support growth and leverage kind of your core infrastructure base. Larry, thanks for the question. Yes, on the second question but we're still in our planning stance and we need to continue to monitor market dynamics, all these factors. I think the one thing is for sure that the margin rhythm is going to be much more balanced throughout. I mean last year, we had one a strategic choice on inventory takedown that was all front-end loaded, right? That was a predominant driver. The execution this year played out exactly as we talked about. As a matter of fact, the past few years, I mean we've executed against everything we said from a margin standpoint the past two years. So that's a big change. FX also was another big front-end item that we don't see that same degree. So I think naturally, we're going to end up with a much more balanced phasing and we'll share more when we provide our official guide in November. But I don't think that's an item that should be tough. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. Yes. I mean, look, '25 is -- we think there's a lot to be excited about. Critical Care is part of it, to your point, that's not a substantive contributor just to be clear, the margin we're generating is fully on the BD base business. So we're well positioned there to now exceed the 25% operating margin goal. Again, importantly, the mix shifts significantly in terms of where margin improvement is coming from, it's coming from gross margin. Look, I think external estimates now are sitting actually just under 9%, right? We see that to the low end of our range, 10% reported is a great starting point, above where we are externally. And like we do every year is, our goal is to continue to create opportunity to exceed that as we move throughout the year; so it's early. We just knew it was important to kind of share context and we've been able to do this, by the way, this year, like on the top line, the questions, deliver strong performance despite these market dynamics. So we'll continue to monitor those but feel really good about how we're positioned moving into 2025."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website, investors.bd.com or by phone at +1 (800) 723-5792 for domestic calls and area code +1 (402) 220-2664 for international calls.\n [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. \nGreg Rodetis: Good morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\n Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents, Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment.\n Before we get started, I want to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis versus a relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted.\n Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation. With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom. \nThomas Polen: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Second quarter revenue growth accelerated significantly as expected, driven by the strength of our portfolio, increasing volumes across our consumables and Alaris. Margin performance drove adjusted EPS ahead of our expectations and consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong cash flow and are on track to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth. These results give us the confidence to once again increase our FY '24 adjusted EPS guidance.\n Turning to our BD 2025 strategy. We continue to execute well on the actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted growth profile. One such area is the strong cadence of new innovation across our connected medication management suite, which delivers many unique benefits to our customers.\n Q2 was the second full quarter since clearance of our new Alaris system and first half Alaris sales have already eclipsed our total FY '23 performance. Our return to market is ramping faster than initially planned, which wouldn't be possible without our manufacturing team who have executed extremely well in scaling Alaris production. Q2 set an all-time record in both the number of BD Alaris pumps manufactured and the number of pumps shipped in a quarter to upgrade our customers to the cleared version of the pump. We have also seen acceleration of committed contracts, inclusive of competitive conversions as health systems value the capability of Alaris and look to standardize their fleet. This offers confidence in the planned second half contribution to growth and will support momentum heading into FY '25.\n The Alaris 510(k) clearance is just the beginning. As we have shared, we are excited about our innovation roadmap, and we are planning upcoming Alaris 510(k) submissions to further strengthen our capabilities, like best-in-class interoperability with over 800 live sites, introduce a steady flow of new customer innovations and ensure continuous compliance. Examples such as over-the-air technology for efficient software updates and continued advanced cybersecurity are planned in the next submission later this calendar year.\n Beyond Alaris, we have a market-leading connected medication management portfolio across inventory management, compounding, pharmacy automation, medication dispensing and infusion and are excited about future innovations and development. This includes new medication dispensing and informatics innovation, including the next generation of our Pyxis dispensing platform, which innovates on our hardware design and will advance our cloud connectivity.\n We continue to scale our BD Health sites informatics platform, now live in over 1,000 sites, and have upcoming launches to integrate hospital medication data from Pyxis with non-acute medication data from our MedBank and MedKeeper platforms, to bring visibility to medication flows across the customers care network.\n In Q2, we made meaningful progress achieving other key R&D milestones, including several in our peripheral vascular disease platform, which is one of our key growth areas. Longer term, these technologies are each expected to deliver over $50 million in incremental fifth year revenue and will broaden our leadership in the $5 billion PVD category that is growing high single digits.\n In our venous portfolio, we have now enrolled over 60 patients in our ARCH pivotal IDE for our BD Liverty TIPS Stent Graft. This novel self-expanding covered stent improves the standard of care for portal hypertension. Building on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and strengthening our presence in the venous market.\n In our arterial portfolio, we enrolled the first patient in our AGILITY pivotal IDE study for our low-profile arterial stent graft, a differentiated technology that minimizes access site complications with precise stent placement that could provide an important new treatment option for over 18 million patients with peripheral arterial disease in the U.S. alone.\n We also filed our SCION SFA pivotal IDE submission with the FDA for our new sirolimus DCB for the treatment of PAD. We see this new alternative drug platform as a key growth catalyst for both SFA and below-the-knee applications.\n We are also executing well on our simplification strategy to drive margin expansion. We are seeing growing momentum as we scale our BD Excellence operating system and build world-class lean management systems and culture throughout BD. This drove strong Q2 performance in areas such as waste reduction and production efficiency, contributing to our margin goals.\n Our focus on cash flow also continues to deliver positive results, generating about $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the first half. This strong start to FY '24 positions us to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flow for the full year. It also enables continued execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy including accretive M&A opportunities in higher-growth categories and opportunistically returning cash to shareholders.\n Lastly, our teams around the world continue to make advancements on our corporate sustainability strategy. We were recently named among Fortune Magazine's Most Innovative Companies list, a testament to our 70,000 associates who work every day to deliver innovation that meaningfully advances the standard of care around the world. We continue to forge partnerships that expand access to these critical innovations. And most recently, we announced the first-ever option in Singapore for women to self-collect a sample for cervical cancer screening in the privacy of their own home.\n In summary, we are delivering accelerated revenue growth, are executing ahead of our plan on Alaris and driving strong margin performance with a growing contribution from BD Excellence. We once again raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD 2025 goals. I'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. \nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well on our performance goals in Q2. As expected, we delivered strong acceleration in our revenue growth, we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered very strong free cash flow growth.\n I'll now provide some insights into our revenue performance in the quarter. Q2 revenue was $5 billion, with organic growth of 5.7%, driven by strong volume. Growth was led by double-digit growth in BD Interventional with low single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Life Sciences. Total Q2 revenue growth of 4.7% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform.\n Regionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., partially offset by expected market dynamics in China. In BD Medical, growth was led by Medication Management with strong performance in infusion systems driven by the BD Alaris return to market and mid-single-digit growth across our Medication Delivery Solutions portfolio in the U.S. and EMEA. Strong demand in our Pharmaceutical Systems, pre-fill devices for biologic drugs offset transitory market dynamics across the industry, including customer inventory destocking.\n BD Life Sciences performance was led by Integrated Diagnostic Solutions with high single-digit growth in our microbiology platforms and mid-single-digit growth in specimen management, which offset a comparison to the prior year and transitory market dynamics in select segments in Biosciences.\n BD Interventional Organic growth was led by continued strong growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth, along with related licensing revenue. Surgery delivered another strong quarter with double-digit organic growth, supported by global adoption of our Phasix resorbable scaffold.\n Lastly, growth was supported by Peripheral Intervention with double-digit growth in our peripheral vascular disease platform, where we continue to drive market penetration with our Rotarex atherectomy system and our venous portfolio. The quarter's performance reflects the breadth of the BD portfolio that delivers a durable growth profile.\n Now moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 53% and adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, both above our expectations. For adjusted gross margin, our simplification and BD Excellence initiatives are continuing to drive net cost improvement and sequentially, as planned, we saw a reduced impact from prior year inventory reductions that increased cash flow, driven by strong SSG&A, expense reductions and leverage, our adjusted operating margin increased sequentially by 410 basis points and year-over-year by 160 basis points with Q2 being above our fiscal year '23 full year margin.\n As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q2 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.17, which grew double digits or 10.8% on a reported basis. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date free cash flow increased more than $900 million year-over-year to over $1.1 billion. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including our actions to optimize inventory levels, continued discipline around capital investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefits from our BD Excellence operating system.\n We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in FY '24 and remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals. With our strong cash flow, year-to-date, we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders, including dividends and $500 million in share repurchases.\n We improved our net debt position ending Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. Our cash and short-term investments balance was almost $3.2 billion, inclusive of about $2 billion in proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the calendar year. Collectively, this positions us well to capitalize on accretive value-creating tuck-in M&A.\n Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead for the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving areas of momentum, including Alaris and continue to monitor transitory market dynamics. For the full year, we are maintaining our organic revenue growth guidance range of 5.5% to 6.25%.\n Based on our Q2 margin performance, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $12.95 to $13.15 on a reported basis, which is an increase of $0.11 at the midpoint. Strong delivery in Q2 positions us well to achieve our second half earnings growth targets.\n Regarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates, the impact of currency has moved modestly since our last update. And for illustrative purposes, we see an additional headwind of approximately 40 basis points to full year revenue from translational currency impacts.\n As you think of the second half of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations: First, regarding revenue, the midpoint of our guidance reflects about 7.5% second half organic sales growth with nearly 250 basis points contribution from Alaris and just over 5% growth in the remainder of the BD portfolio. We expect Q3 organic growth of at least 6% with Q4 further accelerating, driven in part by Alaris momentum and improving grow-over dynamics in China.\n For the full year, our assumptions imply just over 100 basis points revenue contribution from Alaris or at least $300 million in FY '24 revenues. Second, we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of at least 50 basis points improvement, which implies full year operating margins of at least 24%. We expect Q3 adjusted operating margin will be modestly higher than Q2, given the strong performance in this quarter.\n We continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD Excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris. Lastly, we expect our tax rate to be ratable across Q3 and Q4 at about 15% when considering the midpoint of our updated full year guidance range.\n In summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we have clear line of sight to deliver our fiscal year '24 revenue guide and another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported over-delivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter the second half, we are on track to achieve our full year margin improvement goals and once again increased our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Additionally, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth, which increases our capacity to support additional value-creating opportunities, including M&A.\n Our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum, and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD 2025 growth objectives. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask about the second half ramp, both from a revenue and margin perspective. So on revenue growth, you need to step up closer to kind of above the full year range in the second half, curious what the underlying drivers there are and how much of that is dependent upon the increased demand you're seeing in Alaris?\n And then on the margin side, curious how much of the outperformance in Q2 was onetime versus underlying? And how you're thinking about the second half and how much of that's kind of derisked versus 3 months ago? \nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks for the question, Travis. Yes. So first of all, we were pleased with the quarter. To your point on revenue, one, we did see strong acceleration quarter-over-quarter as expected on revenue. We tried to outline the ramp. Clearly, the back half guidance at our midpoint implies about 7.5% growth. But when you unpack that with the momentum that we have in Alaris, we now expect nearly 250 basis points contribution to our second half growth. That would put us at least $300 million for the full year. So if you strip that out, the rest of the BD portfolio has to perform at just over 5%. We feel confident in that. We have strong areas of momentum.\n I think one thing that you saw in our core performance this quarter was -- our core consumables that are anchored against the core of health care, performing really well as you see strong utilization in the health care system. We continue to see great momentum in areas like PureWick, driving strong outsized double-digit growth in that platform, momentum in PVD. And so there's a lot of pockets of strength that we'll continue to build on there.\n From a margin standpoint, so first, the drivers of the margin that we articulated at the start of the year have played out as expected. To your point, we had really strong execution in the quarter. This is driven by our cost improvement initiatives, the momentum on BD Excellence. So we over-delivered 2 quarters in a row, and we're well on track to deliver the full year, which is at least 50 basis points increase year-over-year. We're just over 24%.\n As you think of the performance in the quarter, it really wasn't one thing. I would just say strong execution throughout and we remain focused on executing in the back half of the year. I think the important thing is in the back half of the year, there were questions about the ramp. Q2 is a strong signal that we're well on track. As a matter of fact, one simple way to think of this is our first half gross margin was about 52%. And we know we had those kind of transient onetime items, the outsized FX and then the decision we made last year to reduce inventory levels, which improved strong cash flow. Those are worth over 200 basis points. Those are completely behind us as we move to the second half. You add that to the 52% and you're basically where we need to be in the back half already.\n So we just have to continue the strong cost improvement. In addition to that, we lapped the outsized inflation. In the front half of the year, that was almost 150 basis points. We cycled through that and that moderates down very low. So lot of momentum in terms of how we're advancing margin.\n And then lastly, what I would point to is, obviously, with that Alaris momentum and ramp through Q3 and Q4, you get a bit of what I would call outsized leverage on the revenue that's also worth about 150 basis points in the back half. As a matter of fact, our OpEx expenditures are not reducing. They're about flat or even up slightly. So it's not about cost reductions in OpEx. It's all about the top line leverage, which we feel good about. \nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Nice quarter. I'll try and ask one that answers a couple of things. As you look at the balance of the year, you said you just need 5% in the base business. So if we look at second quarter, excluding the Urology payment and Alaris, what did the base business do so we could get that kind of comparison?\n And then maybe while you're at it, speak to some of the underlying trends in Pharm Systems and MMS where results came in a little lower, but it sounds like you're very confident for the rest of the year. \nThomas Polen: Thanks, Rob. So I think as we look at the quarter and as we look forward to the year, we feel really good about the momentum and the diversity of BD's portfolio. And I'd say, as you look at the areas across the company, we see particular strengths in Medical, in Intervention, in the Life Science businesses that are focused in the health care provider space, right, that are benefiting from strong utilization across the board.\n You can see our volumes, if you compare volumes this year versus last year, you're seeing strong growth from a volume perspective. And that's, of course, being supplemented by our very strong innovation pipeline as well. That's allowing us -- that strength of our diverse portfolio is allowing us to overcome what we see as transitory market dynamics that you're seeing across companies in the life science research area as well as in the B2B pharm systems marketplace where you're seeing destocking in certain areas.\n With that said, we're seeing really strong growth continue, right, around double-digit growth in biologics. The biologics are now over 40% of our Pharm Systems business. So we feel really good about that. And that percentage in weighting is only increasing, right, towards $1 billion of biologic sales in that area. And so as we think about -- that's one of the strengths of BD's portfolio is those puts and takes across and being able to deliver in multiple different environments, really strong revenue performance. So Chris, anything to add? \nChristopher DelOrefice: I would just add, I think Q2 is certainly representative of the growth rate that we need. We feel good about that. There's all kinds of puts and takes in the P&L. I mean just -- Alaris was a modest contribution. It wasn't significant. It's really most predominant in the second half, and that will be a strong driver for us. I articulated the second half drivers. Keep in mind, in Q2, you had some of these other negative comps, right?\n You mentioned licensing. There was also a licensing headwind that was in our Life Sciences business, and we were cycling through some very large capital installs. That's a space that -- we still feel good about customer interest, have strong momentum, and there were some timing dynamics there with the launch of our technology in BDB and a really strong install result in the quarter. So net-net, there's always lots of puts and takes. The 5% is something that we're confident in as we think of the second half. \nOperator: We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: I guess my one question here is on Alaris, the $300 million, Tom, can you give us a sense on what the implied exit rate number is in Q4 for Alaris? Because I understand from a growth perspective, it might be a little tricky. I know you have some upgrades going on. What is the dollar revenue number implied for Q4? And I know Alaris was raised from $200 million to $300 million, but the organic for fiscal was maintained. Is that just conservatism? \nThomas Polen: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first off, we are really happy that we delivered on our #1 priority last year, which is the clearance of the BD Alaris system. And we said our #1 priority for this year became the relaunch of Alaris and remediation and return to it being a contributing growth driver. And we're certainly delivering exactly on that goal like we did last year. Really proud of our manufacturing team. Hopefully, you heard it in our prepared remarks, right? We went from clearance at the end of Q4 to this past quarter, Q2, setting an all-time record in both the production and shipment numbers of Alaris. That's a combination for sale and remediation, but it really reflects that core manufacturing excellence capability that BD has, which we think is best-in-class in the industry, and this is a great example of it.\n We continue to get really positive customer feedback. We've got positive contract momentum. And as you heard, we've got plans progressing for our next 510(k) submission later this calendar year, which will begin to continue to build new innovations on the back of the 510(k) that we got cleared in Q4.\n So as we think about next year, to your question, we don't put out quarterly guidance by product line by any means. But what I would say is, as Chris said, our current guide implies, as you said, over $300 million, actually closer to $350 million for the year. And we've said before that we expect certainly FY '25 to be at least at our historical run rate, right, which you kind of think of as $400 million. Anything beyond that, we'll get into as we get into FY '25 guidance. But clearly, our performance this year is positioning us really well towards that previously stated goal. \nChristopher DelOrefice: The only thing -- just small thing I would add, we did say that for Q3, you should expect total growth inclusive of Alaris of at least 6%. And then you would expect a sequential step up in Q4. So you think of that step up, a portion of that is going to be Alaris. There's also the China grow-over favorable comp that we'll have, but Alaris is a portion of that. \nOperator: We'll go now to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice quarter here. Chris, I know it's really early, but love to hear your confidence in the 25% operating margin goal in fiscal 2025. And are there items right now we should be aware of, such as TSAs rolling off or an increase in the tax rate that would make double-digit EPS growth challenging next year? \nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks, Larry. Good question. Yes, first of all, to your point, it's a little early to get into 2025. TSA is not material. That's a normal dynamic that happens. As a matter of fact, year-over-year, we're down. So we're actually absorbing that already. And by the time you get through this year, it's not substantive.\n The tax dynamics and things like that are evolving. We'll share more at a future date. I think the key thing is we remain committed to our BD 2025 goals. That remains unchanged. Specifically operating margin, I'm glad you mentioned that. I just think what we've delivered through the first half of this year, the momentum we have with BD Excellence through the back half of this year sets us up nicely with the strong exit rate that gives us confidence in delivering 25% by 2025. I think the big thing that you'll see is the progression from that improvement coming from largely gross margin. So we have really great momentum inside on our improving waste, improving yield in our manufacturing lines that will drive continued momentum there. And that will be a catalyst beyond 2025 as we get to the point that we talk about that, too, that will be very positive, help facilitate reinvestment and continue to drive the top line growth as well. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: We'll go now to Matthew Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: So just because there's a lot of focus on the phasing and the ramp through the second half of the year. I guess, you gave us some math and some confidence in that. I was wondering if you could take the other side of the coin and maybe talk about any risks that you see to that ramp? I mean what would have to go wrong for you not to hit this express progression in revenue acceleration and margin expansion? \nChristopher DelOrefice: Yes. Thanks for the question. I guess -- so 2 things. One on margin. If you think of margin, a lot of the momentum comes from 2 things like I shared, right? One, we just exit those one-timers in the first half. So high confidence that's done. It's behind us. The second thing is, our cost improvement initiatives with -- when you think of a cap and roll period and inventory, we have a strong line of sight to that, and we already know the embedded inflation dynamics that are all locked up. So we have a high degree of confidence in what's flowing through gross margin.\n And then that operating margin, again, is you get natural leverage on top of that from the growth expansion in Q2, which we also feel good about. The momentum of Alaris is part of that kind of outsized back half growth. And we have a strong line of sight to that progression. So really with where we sit in the year, we're feeling good about that. Obviously, we continue to monitor the market dynamics that we touched on within the quarter. That's something that's -- we always have -- look for other levers and opportunities to deliver the full year, but that's probably the thing that we'll continue to watch. \nMatthew Taylor: Can I just ask... \nThomas Polen: Sure, go ahead. \nMatthew Taylor: I just want to ask a follow-up. You mentioned in the presentation some enhancements to Alaris and Pyxis. So I was hoping you could just talk about the importance of those submissions. \nThomas Polen: Yes, sure. Happy to, Matt. So on Alaris, and we'll only share a certain level of information on those at this time. We want to keep some of that surprise for customers in the market as we actually launch them. But on Alaris, we're really happy to be back at the innovation cadence. I think when we got the clearance, not only are we happy to be back servicing our customers and driving growth and getting after remediation, but we're happy to immediately jump back into innovation cadence. And you can see our team didn't hesitate in doing that.\n So the next 510(k) submission on Alaris later this calendar year will include customer benefits, such as over-the-air is planned for that, for software upgrades; advanced cybersecurity features; as well as a number of other components as well as making sure we continue to keep that file updated as part of our compliance strategy. So that's -- really excited about those.\n And on Pyxis, there hasn't been a new Pyxis instrument. There's been software upgrades, but hasn't been a new Pyxis instrument, certainly since we've owned CareFusion, and I think it's been more than 15 years. And so the new Pyxis looks different. It's got -- so it's a new hardware platform that we'll be building off of. It significantly advances our cloud strategy and connectivity as well as continuing with advanced analytics as well as hardware features built into that. So it's a significant new platform that we'll be launching and investing in to continue to serially innovate upon over the next many, many years. But we're excited about the first launches of that plan for next year.\n I'd say -- just say the other thing is that we do continue to invest across our connected medication management portfolio, which is obviously highly unique in the industry. And it's one of those -- we get asked the question about connected care and how we think about it because it can often be used as a buzzword. Our approach to connected care has been we look at major health care processes, and we look at how we use data and connected solutions to then transform them and what we've done in Med Management, right, from software in the pharmacy for compounding and inventory management to Pyxis on the floor to Alaris and our health site platform, which brings that site line or visibility to all the data coming from all of our systems to improve processes. It's a great example of how we're doing that.\n Obviously, we talked about continuing to innovate Alaris, continuing to innovate on Pyxis, but we're also continuing to innovate on other elements of that. And we shared another good example of that earlier today. One of the upcoming launches, how we're taking now not only our Pyxis platform, but 2 of the acquisitions we made over the last couple of years, our MedBank platform, which is basically Pyxis for the non-acute, a benchtop unit and GSL. And we're putting that data now in through health sites so that people will be able to see end-to-end visibility of medications from Pyxis to MedBank to GSL, all integrated. So if you're an IDN, you're trying to manage across the care continuum as you've been acquiring assets there, right? BD is going to be a company that enables you to do that very uniquely as part of our strategy. So yes, thanks for the question, Matt. \nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Miksic with Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Yes, I was on mute. Sorry for that. So just one question, and it's kind of a high-level question, Chris and Tom. You talked about the sequential acceleration in growth, which is evident and the improvement in margins, which you had kind of laid out early in the year. I think when folks look at the results, we're seeing really strong margin growth and strength in the quarter. And what I just mentioned and what you described, sequential acceleration but sort of in an environment where volumes have been stronger across a bunch of med tech businesses. Maybe a touch closer to in line even after adjusting for FX.\n And so I guess the good news and encouraging news around Alaris is great, some of the other business lines that you've talked about is great. Was there anything that's had a surprise on the downside, something that was -- remained challenging longer or anything you'd call out? And maybe how you see that playing out the rest of the year? \nThomas Polen: Yes, I'll take that, Matt. So no, we feel good. It fits right in line with what we -- what I described before, which was you're seeing the diversity of our portfolio, which is a real strength for the company. Where again, those -- the Medical products, Intervention, Life Science businesses that are exposed to health care utilization, health care provider space, right, the vacutainers, the diagnostic systems products, et cetera, along with Intervention and all the Medical products used in that. They're benefiting from that strong utilization and our innovation pipeline that are enabling us to offset what our transitory broad dynamics in the -- that people are seeing in the life science research space and the B2B pharma systems with some destocking, particularly in vaccines and anti-coag.\n So we feel really good about those businesses as well. As I said, we're seeing strong double-digit growth right around double-digit growth in biologics and Pharm Systems. We've got a great pipeline there with key launches later this year, turning over to customers, Libertas and Evolve, for them to start doing trials on. We see in our B2B space, we're still in a market that's going through a cycle that we certainly see some positive signs on with NIH funding, having higher visibility. Overall, we're seeing the FACSDiscover now -- platform. We just launched the 3 and 4 lasers.\n So that's adding access to a more cost-effective option for customers to get into that transformational technology. So we're excited by that. And we're still over delivering, I think, versus what you're seeing comps from others in some of those spaces. And so as those markets end up rebounding, again, which we see that forthcoming over time. We think we're really well positioned there as well, which is just going to help our overall growth. And again, in the meanwhile, that diversified portfolio strength is allowing us to do very well, both on revenue and clearly on a margin perspective. \nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for any additional or closing comments. \nThomas Polen: Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, and thank you for your questions and interest in BD. We look forward to sharing our progress towards delivering our BD 2025 goals and increased outlook for FY '24 on our next call. Have a great rest of the day. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude this audio webcast. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Thomas Polen",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Second quarter revenue growth accelerated significantly as expected, driven by the strength of our portfolio, increasing volumes across our consumables and Alaris. Margin performance drove adjusted EPS ahead of our expectations and consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong cash flow and are on track to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth. These results give us the confidence to once again increase our FY '24 adjusted EPS guidance.\n Turning to our BD 2025 strategy. We continue to execute well on the actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted growth profile. One such area is the strong cadence of new innovation across our connected medication management suite, which delivers many unique benefits to our customers.\n Q2 was the second full quarter since clearance of our new Alaris system and first half Alaris sales have already eclipsed our total FY '23 performance. Our return to market is ramping faster than initially planned, which wouldn't be possible without our manufacturing team who have executed extremely well in scaling Alaris production. Q2 set an all-time record in both the number of BD Alaris pumps manufactured and the number of pumps shipped in a quarter to upgrade our customers to the cleared version of the pump. We have also seen acceleration of committed contracts, inclusive of competitive conversions as health systems value the capability of Alaris and look to standardize their fleet. This offers confidence in the planned second half contribution to growth and will support momentum heading into FY '25.\n The Alaris 510(k) clearance is just the beginning. As we have shared, we are excited about our innovation roadmap, and we are planning upcoming Alaris 510(k) submissions to further strengthen our capabilities, like best-in-class interoperability with over 800 live sites, introduce a steady flow of new customer innovations and ensure continuous compliance. Examples such as over-the-air technology for efficient software updates and continued advanced cybersecurity are planned in the next submission later this calendar year.\n Beyond Alaris, we have a market-leading connected medication management portfolio across inventory management, compounding, pharmacy automation, medication dispensing and infusion and are excited about future innovations and development. This includes new medication dispensing and informatics innovation, including the next generation of our Pyxis dispensing platform, which innovates on our hardware design and will advance our cloud connectivity.\n We continue to scale our BD Health sites informatics platform, now live in over 1,000 sites, and have upcoming launches to integrate hospital medication data from Pyxis with non-acute medication data from our MedBank and MedKeeper platforms, to bring visibility to medication flows across the customers care network.\n In Q2, we made meaningful progress achieving other key R&D milestones, including several in our peripheral vascular disease platform, which is one of our key growth areas. Longer term, these technologies are each expected to deliver over $50 million in incremental fifth year revenue and will broaden our leadership in the $5 billion PVD category that is growing high single digits.\n In our venous portfolio, we have now enrolled over 60 patients in our ARCH pivotal IDE for our BD Liverty TIPS Stent Graft. This novel self-expanding covered stent improves the standard of care for portal hypertension. Building on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and strengthening our presence in the venous market.\n In our arterial portfolio, we enrolled the first patient in our AGILITY pivotal IDE study for our low-profile arterial stent graft, a differentiated technology that minimizes access site complications with precise stent placement that could provide an important new treatment option for over 18 million patients with peripheral arterial disease in the U.S. alone.\n We also filed our SCION SFA pivotal IDE submission with the FDA for our new sirolimus DCB for the treatment of PAD. We see this new alternative drug platform as a key growth catalyst for both SFA and below-the-knee applications.\n We are also executing well on our simplification strategy to drive margin expansion. We are seeing growing momentum as we scale our BD Excellence operating system and build world-class lean management systems and culture throughout BD. This drove strong Q2 performance in areas such as waste reduction and production efficiency, contributing to our margin goals.\n Our focus on cash flow also continues to deliver positive results, generating about $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the first half. This strong start to FY '24 positions us to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flow for the full year. It also enables continued execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy including accretive M&A opportunities in higher-growth categories and opportunistically returning cash to shareholders.\n Lastly, our teams around the world continue to make advancements on our corporate sustainability strategy. We were recently named among Fortune Magazine's Most Innovative Companies list, a testament to our 70,000 associates who work every day to deliver innovation that meaningfully advances the standard of care around the world. We continue to forge partnerships that expand access to these critical innovations. And most recently, we announced the first-ever option in Singapore for women to self-collect a sample for cervical cancer screening in the privacy of their own home.\n In summary, we are delivering accelerated revenue growth, are executing ahead of our plan on Alaris and driving strong margin performance with a growing contribution from BD Excellence. We once again raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD 2025 goals. I'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook. Thanks, Rob. So I think as we look at the quarter and as we look forward to the year, we feel really good about the momentum and the diversity of BD's portfolio. And I'd say, as you look at the areas across the company, we see particular strengths in Medical, in Intervention, in the Life Science businesses that are focused in the health care provider space, right, that are benefiting from strong utilization across the board.\n You can see our volumes, if you compare volumes this year versus last year, you're seeing strong growth from a volume perspective. And that's, of course, being supplemented by our very strong innovation pipeline as well. That's allowing us -- that strength of our diverse portfolio is allowing us to overcome what we see as transitory market dynamics that you're seeing across companies in the life science research area as well as in the B2B pharm systems marketplace where you're seeing destocking in certain areas.\n With that said, we're seeing really strong growth continue, right, around double-digit growth in biologics. The biologics are now over 40% of our Pharm Systems business. So we feel really good about that. And that percentage in weighting is only increasing, right, towards $1 billion of biologic sales in that area. And so as we think about -- that's one of the strengths of BD's portfolio is those puts and takes across and being able to deliver in multiple different environments, really strong revenue performance. So Chris, anything to add? Yes. Thanks for the question. So first off, we are really happy that we delivered on our #1 priority last year, which is the clearance of the BD Alaris system. And we said our #1 priority for this year became the relaunch of Alaris and remediation and return to it being a contributing growth driver. And we're certainly delivering exactly on that goal like we did last year. Really proud of our manufacturing team. Hopefully, you heard it in our prepared remarks, right?

We've got positive contract momentum. And as you heard, we've got plans progressing for our next 510(k) submission later this calendar year, which will begin to continue to build new innovations on the back of the 510(k) that we got cleared in Q4.\n So as we think about next year, to your question, we don't put out quarterly guidance by product line by any means. But what I would say is, as Chris said, our current guide implies, as you said, over $300 million, actually closer to $350 million for the year. And we've said before that we expect certainly FY '25 to be at least at our historical run rate, right, which you kind of think of as $400 million. Anything beyond that, we'll get into as we get into FY '25 guidance. But clearly, our performance this year is positioning us really well towards that previously stated goal. Sure, go ahead. Yes, sure. Happy to, Matt. So on Alaris, and we'll only share a certain level of information on those at this time. We want to keep some of that surprise for customers in the market as we actually launch them. But on Alaris, we're really happy to be back at the innovation cadence.

We look forward to sharing our progress towards delivering our BD 2025 goals and increased outlook for FY '24 on our next call. Have a great rest of the day."

            "name": "Christopher DelOrefice",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well on our performance goals in Q2. As expected, we delivered strong acceleration in our revenue growth, we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered very strong free cash flow growth.\n I'll now provide some insights into our revenue performance in the quarter. Q2 revenue was $5 billion, with organic growth of 5.7%, driven by strong volume. Growth was led by double-digit growth in BD Interventional with low single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Life Sciences. Total Q2 revenue growth of 4.7% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform.\n Regionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., partially offset by expected market dynamics in China. In BD Medical, growth was led by Medication Management with strong performance in infusion systems driven by the BD Alaris return to market and mid-single-digit growth across our Medication Delivery Solutions portfolio in the U.S. and EMEA. Strong demand in our Pharmaceutical Systems, pre-fill devices for biologic drugs offset transitory market dynamics across the industry, including customer inventory destocking.\n BD Life Sciences performance was led by Integrated Diagnostic Solutions with high single-digit growth in our microbiology platforms and mid-single-digit growth in specimen management, which offset a comparison to the prior year and transitory market dynamics in select segments in Biosciences.\n BD Interventional Organic growth was led by continued strong growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth, along with related licensing revenue. Surgery delivered another strong quarter with double-digit organic growth, supported by global adoption of our Phasix resorbable scaffold.\n Lastly, growth was supported by Peripheral Intervention with double-digit growth in our peripheral vascular disease platform, where we continue to drive market penetration with our Rotarex atherectomy system and our venous portfolio. The quarter's performance reflects the breadth of the BD portfolio that delivers a durable growth profile.\n Now moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 53% and adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, both above our expectations. For adjusted gross margin, our simplification and BD Excellence initiatives are continuing to drive net cost improvement and sequentially, as planned, we saw a reduced impact from prior year inventory reductions that increased cash flow, driven by strong SSG&A, expense reductions and leverage, our adjusted operating margin increased sequentially by 410 basis points and year-over-year by 160 basis points with Q2 being above our fiscal year '23 full year margin.\n As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q2 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.17, which grew double digits or 10.8% on a reported basis. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date free cash flow increased more than $900 million year-over-year to over $1.1 billion. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including our actions to optimize inventory levels, continued discipline around capital investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefits from our BD Excellence operating system.\n We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in FY '24 and remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals. With our strong cash flow, year-to-date, we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders, including dividends and $500 million in share repurchases.\n We improved our net debt position ending Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. Our cash and short-term investments balance was almost $3.2 billion, inclusive of about $2 billion in proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the calendar year. Collectively, this positions us well to capitalize on accretive value-creating tuck-in M&A.\n Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead for the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving areas of momentum, including Alaris and continue to monitor transitory market dynamics. For the full year, we are maintaining our organic revenue growth guidance range of 5.5% to 6.25%.\n Based on our Q2 margin performance, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $12.95 to $13.15 on a reported basis, which is an increase of $0.11 at the midpoint. Strong delivery in Q2 positions us well to achieve our second half earnings growth targets.\n Regarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates, the impact of currency has moved modestly since our last update. And for illustrative purposes, we see an additional headwind of approximately 40 basis points to full year revenue from translational currency impacts.\n As you think of the second half of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations: First, regarding revenue, the midpoint of our guidance reflects about 7.5% second half organic sales growth with nearly 250 basis points contribution from Alaris and just over 5% growth in the remainder of the BD portfolio. We expect Q3 organic growth of at least 6% with Q4 further accelerating, driven in part by Alaris momentum and improving grow-over dynamics in China.\n For the full year, our assumptions imply just over 100 basis points revenue contribution from Alaris or at least $300 million in FY '24 revenues. Second, we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of at least 50 basis points improvement, which implies full year operating margins of at least 24%. We expect Q3 adjusted operating margin will be modestly higher than Q2, given the strong performance in this quarter.\n We continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD Excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris. Lastly, we expect our tax rate to be ratable across Q3 and Q4 at about 15% when considering the midpoint of our updated full year guidance range.\n In summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we have clear line of sight to deliver our fiscal year '24 revenue guide and another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported over-delivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter the second half, we are on track to achieve our full year margin improvement goals and once again increased our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Additionally, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth, which increases our capacity to support additional value-creating opportunities, including M&A.\n Our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum, and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD 2025 growth objectives. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue? Yes. Thanks for the question, Travis. Yes. So first of all, we were pleased with the quarter. To your point on revenue, one, we did see strong acceleration quarter-over-quarter as expected on revenue. We tried to outline the ramp. Clearly, the back half guidance at our midpoint implies about 7.5% growth. But when you unpack that with the momentum that we have in Alaris, we now expect nearly 250 basis points contribution to our second half growth. That would put us at least $300 million for the full year. So if you strip that out, the rest of the BD portfolio has to perform at just over 5%. We feel confident in that. We have strong areas of momentum.\n I think one thing that you saw in our core performance this quarter was -- our core consumables that are anchored against the core of health care, performing really well as you see strong utilization in the health care system. We continue to see great momentum in areas like PureWick, driving strong outsized double-digit growth in that platform, momentum in PVD. And so there's a lot of pockets of strength that we'll continue to build on there.\n From a margin standpoint, so first, the drivers of the margin that we articulated at the start of the year have played out as expected. To your point, we had really strong execution in the quarter. This is driven by our cost improvement initiatives, the momentum on BD Excellence. So we over-delivered 2 quarters in a row, and we're well on track to deliver the full year, which is at least 50 basis points increase year-over-year. We're just over 24%.\n As you think of the performance in the quarter, it really wasn't one thing. I would just say strong execution throughout and we remain focused on executing in the back half of the year. I think the important thing is in the back half of the year, there were questions about the ramp. Q2 is a strong signal that we're well on track. As a matter of fact, one simple way to think of this is our first half gross margin was about 52%. And we know we had those kind of transient onetime items, the outsized FX and then the decision we made last year to reduce inventory levels, which improved strong cash flow. Those are worth over 200 basis points. Those are completely behind us as we move to the second half. You add that to the 52% and you're basically where we need to be in the back half already.\n So we just have to continue the strong cost improvement. In addition to that, we lapped the outsized inflation. In the front half of the year, that was almost 150 basis points. We cycled through that and that moderates down very low. So lot of momentum in terms of how we're advancing margin.\n And then lastly, what I would point to is, obviously, with that Alaris momentum and ramp through Q3 and Q4, you get a bit of what I would call outsized leverage on the revenue that's also worth about 150 basis points in the back half. As a matter of fact, our OpEx expenditures are not reducing. They're about flat or even up slightly. So it's not about cost reductions in OpEx. It's all about the top line leverage, which we feel good about. I would just add, I think Q2 is certainly representative of the growth rate that we need. We feel good about that. There's all kinds of puts and takes in the P&L. I mean just -- Alaris was a modest contribution. It wasn't significant. It's really most predominant in the second half, and that will be a strong driver for us. I articulated the second half drivers. Keep in mind, in Q2, you had some of these other negative comps, right?\n You mentioned licensing. There was also a licensing headwind that was in our Life Sciences business, and we were cycling through some very large capital installs. That's a space that -- we still feel good about customer interest, have strong momentum, and there were some timing dynamics there with the launch of our technology in BDB and a really strong install result in the quarter. So net-net, there's always lots of puts and takes. The 5% is something that we're confident in as we think of the second half. The only thing -- just small thing I would add, we did say that for Q3, you should expect total growth inclusive of Alaris of at least 6%. And then you would expect a sequential step up in Q4. So you think of that step up, a portion of that is going to be Alaris. There's also the China grow-over favorable comp that we'll have, but Alaris is a portion of that. Yes. Thanks, Larry. Good question. Yes, first of all, to your point, it's a little early to get into 2025. TSA is not material. That's a normal dynamic that happens. As a matter of fact, year-over-year, we're down. So we're actually absorbing that already. And by the time you get through this year, it's not substantive.\n The tax dynamics and things like that are evolving. We'll share more at a future date. I think the key thing is we remain committed to our BD 2025 goals. That remains unchanged. Specifically operating margin, I'm glad you mentioned that. I just think what we've delivered through the first half of this year, the momentum we have with BD Excellence through the back half of this year sets us up nicely with the strong exit rate that gives us confidence in delivering 25% by 2025. I think the big thing that you'll see is the progression from that improvement coming from largely gross margin. So we have really great momentum inside on our improving waste, improving yield in our manufacturing lines that will drive continued momentum there. And that will be a catalyst beyond 2025 as we get to the point that we talk about that, too, that will be very positive, help facilitate reinvestment and continue to drive the top line growth as well. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question. I guess -- so 2 things. One on margin. If you think of margin, a lot of the momentum comes from 2 things like I shared, right? One, we just exit those one-timers in the first half. So high confidence that's done. It's behind us. The second thing is, our cost improvement initiatives with -- when you think of a cap and roll period and inventory, we have a strong line of sight to that, and we already know the embedded inflation dynamics that are all locked up. So we have a high degree of confidence in what's flowing through gross margin.\n And then that operating margin, again, is you get natural leverage on top of that from the growth expansion in Q2, which we also feel good about. The momentum of Alaris is part of that kind of outsized back half growth. And we have a strong line of sight to that progression. So really with where we sit in the year, we're feeling good about that. Obviously, we continue to monitor the market dynamics that we touched on within the quarter. That's something that's -- we always have -- look for other levers and opportunities to deliver the full year, but that's probably the thing that we'll continue to watch."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website investors.bd.com or by phone at 800-688-7339 for domestic calls and area code +1 402-220-1347 for international calls. For today's call, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations.\nGreg Rodetis: Good morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our business, strategy and performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com. Leading today's calls are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide highlights of our performance and the continued execution of our BD 2025 strategy. Chris will then provide additional details on our Q1 financial performance and our updated guidance for fiscal 2024. Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents, Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. I encourage you to read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically noted as a calendar period. I would also call your attention to the non-GAAP reconciliations included in the appendices of the press release and earnings presentation. With that, I\u2019m very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Polen: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported our results for the first quarter. Overall, we executed Q1 as expected. Total revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations. And on the bottom line, adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin goals through our BD Excellence operating system and the timing of discrete tax item. Also consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong growth in cash flow that positions us well to deliver another year of growing free cash flow double-digits. I want to thank our team of over 70,000 associates for the strong execution, agility and unrelenting determination to deliver for our customers, patients and shareholders. These results give us the confidence to increase our FY '24 guidance. Turning to our BD 2025 strategy. During Q1, we continued to execute well against the five actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes continuing to advance our innovation pipeline which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted revenue growth profile. We remain focused on advancing innovation in high growth areas, anchored against three irreversible forces we see reshaping healthcare today and over the next decade, connected care, new care settings and chronic disease. Specifically in Q1, we made meaningful progress achieving several key R&D milestones for technologies that position BD as key enablers of care shift in new settings. In our PureWick portfolio, which is now the market's leading platform for non-invasive urine management in a billion dollar market growing double-digits. We started our randomized clinical trial pilots for PureWick Female to generate evidence to support future at-home reimbursement. Our PureWick program is progressing well and we remain on track to launch our next-generation Female External Catheter later this fiscal year, which will provide a better patient experience in a more dignified way for women to manage their urinary incontinence. In Q1, we received 510(k) clearance for our new BD MiniDraw Capillary Blood Collection System. Based on a recent study, two-thirds of patients prefer MiniDraw's finger-stick collection in a retail setting over a previous experience with the traditional Venous blood draw. Since it does not require a phlebotomist, MiniDraw can expand access to sample collection for several routine blood tests to new settings such as retail clinics and pharmacies. And lastly, in molecular diagnostics, we initiated clinical trial enrollment for the BD Elience Point-of-Care Molecular platform. In our first assay, a rapid CT/GC test for in-office testing and treatment. BD Elience enables BD to enter into the high growth molecular point-of-care market. We continue to see molecular diagnostics as a strong growth catalyst as evidenced by double-digit growth this quarter in our BD COR and BD MAX platforms where we continue to leverage our growing installed base through menu expansion with more than 20 assays currently available on BD MAX. Both NextGen PureWick and BD MiniDraw are on track to launch later this fiscal year and we anticipate our first 510(k) submission for the BD Elience system and our first assay this fiscal year as well. Regarding Alaris, servicing our customers and bringing all Alaris pumps in the field up to the cleared standard remains our priority. Customer response has been very positive with strong momentum, engaging with customers. And while it is still early in the process, I'm pleased with our progress and as we recently shared, we now believe $200 million as the floor on revenue in fiscal '24. We are also executing well on our broad simplification strategy to drive margin expansion and a double-digit base EPS CAGR through FY '25. This includes accelerating adoption of our BD Excellence Operating System, which focuses on the application of lean principles to drive excellence everywhere, every day across our plants and business and is driving productivity gains across our operations. In FY '23, we held 18 week-long Kaizen events. And in Q1 FY '24 alone, we executed as many, a trajectory, which will continue through the rest of FY '24. We've deployed this mindset outside of our factories, driving greater efficiency through the organization at all levels. Our BD Excellence Operating System is an important new capability we're building to drive a world-class culture of continuous improvement and lean management throughout BD. We also progressed our Project Recode initiatives including our network optimization effort to drive plant efficiencies. We have multiple site consolidations either completed or underway to reduce our footprint by approximately 20%. The combination of BD Excellence with our recode network architecture program is supporting our FY '24 goals, contributing to our plan for 25% operating margins in FY '25. And also, now providing visibility for continued margin expansion beyond FY '25. We're also seeing our systematic focus on cash flow continuing to yield results. Through working capital efficiencies and our BD Excellence Operating System, driving more efficient CapEx spend, we delivered over $850 million in operating cash flows in Q1. This strong execution to start the year positions us well to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flows in FY '24 and positions us to capitalize on M&A opportunities in higher growth categories and opportunistically return cash to shareholders. Lastly, our teams around the world continue to make meaningful advancements on our ESG strategy. Just last week, we announced a collaboration with the Kenyan government to advance access to critical cancer diagnostics for women in Kenya through self-sampling, furthering our commitment to expanding health equity and access around the world. We see the power of the cell sampling model is applicable across other underserved markets, as well as in the U.S. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q1 and the solid margin execution, which enables us to raise guidance for fiscal 2024. With strong progress of our innovation pipeline and growing momentum from BD Excellence and our simplification programs, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD 2025 goals. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well against our performance goals in Q1. Q1 revenue growth was largely as we expected and I'm pleased to share we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered strong cash flow that positions us well to support our double-digit free cash flow growth goal. I'll now provide some insight into our revenue performance in the quarter. Additional detail can be found in today\u2019s earnings' announcement and presentation. Q1 revenue was $4.7 billion with organic growth of 2.4% that was driven by high-single digit organic growth in BD Interventional and solid growth in BD Medical with China market dynamics playing out as expected, partially offset by a decline in BD Life Sciences, which was impacted by the comparison to the prior year respiratory season. As expected, China and respiratory were the primary drivers of Q1 revenue growth under indexing our full year goal. The respiratory season alone impacted total company growth by about 150 basis points. Regionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., EMEA and Latin America, partially offset by the expected decline in China. Total Q1 revenue growth of 1.6% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. Turning to the segment performance. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 2.4%, driven by growth and medication management solutions and pharmaceutical systems, min-single digit growth in MMS was led by strong performance in dispensing, driven by innovations in our BD Pyxis portfolio that are improving nursing workflows and efficiencies. In our infusion business, we are pleased with our strong progress, bringing the BD Alaris Infusion System back to the market and continue to expect Alaris to ramp over the course of the year. Infusion also reflects strong demand for IV sets. Performance in Pharmacy Automation reflects the comparison to an outsized quarter in the prior year and the timing of planned capital installations. Growth of 3.4% in Pharmaceutical Systems was in line with our expectations and was led by strong double-digit growth in pre-filled devices for biologics and as expected, was partially offset by customer inventory dynamics, including a slowdown in demand for anticoagulants. Growth in Medication Delivery Solutions was about flat and slightly ahead of our expectations. Our Vascular Access Management strategy continues to drive strong performance particularly in Catheter Solutions. As expected, MDS growth was impacted by market dynamics in China including volume based procurement, which continues to play out within our expectations. BD Life Sciences revenue of $1.3 billion declined 2.5% which reflects a decline in IDS as a result of a tough comparison in the respiratory season worth nearly 500 basis points. It was partially offset by strong growth in biosciences. Performance in IDS reflects the tough comparison in respiratory testing that was partially offset by high-single digit growth in our Microbiology platforms and double-digit growth in Molecular IVD assays on both our BD MAX and BD COR platforms. Biosciences grew 5.7% as expected despite a strong comparison in the prior year. BDB performance was driven by strong mid-single digit growth in our research and clinical platforms that reflects double-digit growth in research instruments, driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter and double-digit growth in Clinical Reagents as we continue to leverage our growing installed base of FACSLyric and FACSDuet solutions. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 4.7% and 8.4% organic, which excludes the impact of the surgical instruments divestiture. BDI organic growth was led by surgery and UCC. In surgery, double-digit organic growth was led by continued market adoption of our leading Phasix resorbable hernia products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. High-single digit growth in urology was led by strong double-digit growth in our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions with continued strong demand in both the acute care and home care settings. Mid-single digit growth in PI was in line with our expectations and reflects growth across the portfolio. It was partially offset by the expected timing of distributor orders. In our peripheral vascular disease platform, we continue to drive market penetration with our Rotarex Atherectomy System and our Venous portfolio. Performance in our oncology business was driven by growth in biopsy, including strong market acceptance of our recently launched BD Trek powered bone biopsy system. Now moving to our P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 51.1% and adjusted operating margin of 20.2% were ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin improvement goals across our portfolio of simplification initiatives and strong SSG&A expense leverage. R&D spend was in line with our expectations. In addition, as we previously shared a discrete tax item that was contemplated in our full-year tax rate was realized in Q1. As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q1 operating income and our adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in an EPS of $2.68. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, Q1 cash flows from operations totaled over $850 million. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including good management of inventory levels, continued discipline around CapEx investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefit from our simplification programs and BD Excellence Operating System. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and expect another step improvement in FY '24. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we also remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%. Beyond our investments in growth, we returned $775 million in capital to shareholders, including dividends and $500 million in share repurchases. We ended Q1 with a cash balance of $1.2 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7 times. Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Based on our Q1 performance, including the strong momentum in many parts of our business and progression of our margin improvement initiatives, we raised the midpoint of our FY '24 organic revenue growth guidance, and raised our adjusted EPS guidance, increasing the midpoint by $0.09. The increase to adjusted EPS reflects Q1 operational outperformance and a small improvement in FX. As a result, we now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 6.25%, which increases our midpoint to slightly above 5.8%. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS, including the impact of currency to be in a range of $12.82 to $13.06, which reflects about $12.94 at the midpoint. Regarding foreign currency based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency has improved modestly and for the full year is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 25 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 360 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis. As you think of phasing over the balance of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations. First, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the expected ramp in Alaris along with the easing of prior year comparisons, such as China. Second, our updated guidance reflects an improved margin cadence over the balance of the year. Specific to Q2, adjusted gross margin is in line with our prior expectation and continues to reflect significant sequential improvement given the lessening impacts from inflation, prior year inventory reductions and FX. We now expect Q2 adjusted operating margin to expand by 25 basis points to 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued margin improvement efforts and continued leverage in SSG&A. Third, the discrete tax item realized in Q1 was largely a shift from Q2 and results and revised phasing of our full year effective tax rate. Based on this timing dynamic, we currently expect our Q2 tax rate to be nearly 17%. We expect strong operating performance to offset the tax phasing impact, and as a result, there are no changes to our expectations for Q2 adjusted earnings per share. Lastly, we remain confident in delivering about 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the year. As a reminder, the first half inventory impact is transitory and behind us as we exit Q2. And as FX and inflation moderate at a meaningful rate to the back half, coupled with a continuation of the first half margin improvement, we expect to deliver from our strong simplification portfolio, we can naturally achieve our second half margin goals. In summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and new innovation, we have clear line of sight to deliver our FY '24 revenue guide which at the midpoint is above our 5.5% plus target and results in a three year CAGR of nearly 7% growth. I'm pleased with the continued strong execution by our talented organization to start the year, which supported over delivering on our margin and operating income goals and increasing our earnings outlook. With a strong quarter of cash flow, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth, which increases our capacity to support additional value creating opportunities including M&A. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver against our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Good morning, Rick.\nRick Wise: Tom, hi, Chris. You used the word confidence repeatedly, and just picking up on that, heading into the quarter, we know you were very clear about things like currency and the peso divestitures, the flu benefit, if you will, time shift, but the setup and your new guidance clearly says that the rest of the year, we're going to see accelerating organic growth second half, I think your language in the slide, above full year guide. Help us, maybe you could talk in little more detail about the drivers of sales acceleration than the things that are most critical to creating that outlook that you're feeling confident about.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rick, and good to connect. So, as you said, Q1 played out as expected, total revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations, as you said, there were really two factors that we recognize we're going to be playing out in Q1. One was the flu compare given the large kind of early timing last year that was about 150 basis points that we knew was going to happen and then value-based procurement in China. And those two factors played out actually exactly as we expected in China, in fact that we were watching that and we saw VOBP stay focused within MDS which was just our assumption. We had really strong growth in BDI within the quarter, double-digit, mid-teen growth, high-single digit growth in life sciences and so we saw that play out. China actually did a little bit better than budgeted in Q1 and so we feel good that that's going to continue to play out for the year. I think, as we also think about the back part of the year to your question, something else we are looking at as we started and gave guidance to begin, '24 was, of course, Alaris. We were really pleased to have Alaris back with new improvements. Our new 510(k), it's a big deal to be back servicing our customers fully. It's a great product and highly unique and so, of course, Q1 was really the first quarter with Alaris relaunched and our team backed it proactively upgrading and remediating our base and we wanted to get feedback and engagement. And it's been quite positive, and I think that part also, as we look ahead, that confidence in those early engagements and the progress we're making is what's led us to also comment that we're seeing now $200 million as the floor for the year. In the other aspects, as you think about the growth drivers that we've been talking about and we often call out six specific platforms, we saw a really great growth in PureWick this quarter. Pharm systems, we have signaled very clearly the anticoagulant topic that was going to create a slower compare or slower growth in Q1. We're seeing the underlying business there do really well. Biologics grew double-digits in the quarter. Flow playing out, strong demand for FACSDiscover, Molecular double-digit growth as you heard in the prepared remarks, Peripheral Vascular and Pharmacy Automation, those trends in the marketplace continue with strong outlooks for those businesses. So again, we saw very clearly the two factors that we knew were going to impact us in Q1 and they played out as expected. Chris, any other comments to add.\nChristopher DelOrefice: I mean, just, sometimes, it's easier just play bigger picture right. I'm sure you're looking at our balance to go plans which we are very confident into Tom's point. We've expressed confidence in Alaris and establishing a floor now. I think the Alaris dynamics important. If you look at the balance to go, it's about 7% revenue growth. Last two years, we delivered right around 7%. This year, actually, if you think about it, Alaris is going to cycle over medical necessity. It's not a significant contributor to growth in the first half despite seeing very strong progress, but what that does is it adds about a point to growth more in the second half, right? So, we see really good momentum there. So when you think of sort of Alaris adjusted, you're at six and we cycle over the China compare in Q4, which have declined as well. So, I think plans are intact, the strong underlying fundamentals in kind of these six key areas we keep pointing to, like, Tom mentioned in biologics are well positioned and feel good about the rest of the year.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, Rick.\nRick Wise: Yeah. And just as a follow-up, I'd ask about the EPS guide, the $0.07, Chris, I think, I'm calculating correctly, you beat operationally EPS. You've raised $0.09 at the midpoint for the full year. Talk about your confidence in that driving that midpoint EPS raise. Again, how margins are -- in more detail, are going to, or mix or volume are going to help you get to those EPS targets? Thank you.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. We were definitely pleased with the margin progression and operating income delivery Q1 and it was strong and exceeded expectations. We basically passed that through to your point. The other thing we did is we actually accelerated margin improvement in Q2 by about 25 basis points to 50 basis points, so de-risks the back half of the year. We did that on a couple of things. Whenever you start the year, you want to ask -- you want to see a couple of things. One, to recall some of these transitory headwinds like China. We knew we had a transitory item in inventory that hit us in the first quarter that was 200 basis points. We have outsized FX in the quarter. All those played out as expected and we have stronger delivery on calling inflation dynamics and more importantly, our margin improvement program. So, we continue to accelerate those. We've had two years now of consistent track record of delivering against our margin expectations, back to pre-pandemic levels 400 basis points over two years. If you look at our margin progression throughout the year, basically, with these transitory items behind you, the level of cost improvement we delivered in Q1 alone with moderating outsized inflation through the back half of the year. It goes from nearly -- in Q1, we said it was almost 2x what we're calling for the full year and outsized inflation 100 basis points. It cuts in half in Q2 and then moderates in the back half. So, we just have to keep executing against our margin improvement portfolio, which is really strong. And that's what gave us confidence with the Q1 performance and our ongoing programs to raise for the year and we're focused on executing against that.\nRick Wise: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll take the first question on revenue. Just curious if there's anything to call out in some of non-flu areas, pharm systems MMS. If you think kind of growth outlook, they are still on track with your expectations, and the decision to raise the revenue guidance. Just curious, what's giving you the confidence at this stage to go ahead and raise that revenue guidance at this point.\nTom Polen: Yeah, Travis. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. Good morning. So, on pharm systems specifically, again, as I mentioned, we saw that play out as expected with the impact of the one customer that we mentioned in anticoagulants and strong underlying growth beyond that, again, double-digit growth in biologics. Our capacity continues to -- those investments that we made continue to play out as expected. We have capacity to meet customer needs, and we're engaged very actively in that space. And as we think about the slight raise on revenue, again, we feel really Alaris the floor of 200, as we see now for the year based on, again, early engagement with customers. We thought that was prudent to do given our outlook in that space. I don't know, Mike, if you have any other comments to add.\nMichael Garrison: Just also commented in addition to the double-digit demand in biologics, we've been pretty successful in terms of entering, the development agreements for future pipeline of molecules in this space, our innovation portfolio around Hypak and Neopak, and also the wearables portfolio with Libertas and above that continues to progress really well and additional developments -- development agreement in this area are occurring. We've described the pharm systems business is a high-single digit grower, going back to Investor Day and we continue to see that in '24. It's our expectation, despite any early part of the year headwinds.\nTravis Steed: Great. And last question, Chris, just on margin in Q1 was a nice kind of core outperformance on margins in Q1, especially without the revenue upside. Just curious kind of go through what got better in Q1 on the margin side and confidence, and what gets better if you think about that 300 basis point step-up in margins from Q1 to Q2, just to give some confidence that that 300 basis point step-up sequentially is achievable?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thanks, Travis. So, first of all, in the quarter, it wasn't one thing. I'd just say execution is kind of the theme here, organization is hyper focused consistent with what we've done is predominantly our cost improvement programs. We had some mix benefit as well which has been part of our strategy on portfolio as well. So, all of that, I would say, the headwinds kind of played out as expected and we over delivered through good focus, execution on our margin improvement initiatives. To your point, the Q1 step-up, the step-up from Q1 to Q2 about 300 basis points that we've signaled. If you think of it this way, again, we had two, what I would call, pretty transitory items in Q1. We have the outsized FX, coupled with the inventory reduction in absorption dynamic. Those two items alone as you head into Q2 are about 30%, so as we're 400 basis points. They're only about 30% of that value in Q2. So, you pick up momentum there, coupled with the fact that the outsized inflation, which was almost 2x, what we call, for the year in Q1. It starts moderating significantly almost in half in Q2 and then it further moderates by the back half of the year. So really, it's just cycling over those kind of one-time items, outsized inflation moderating back and us continuing to deliver what we already delivered in Q1. So, we're confident that that progression continues. With that, you naturally get the sequential step-up that we're driving towards. And again, feel good about our operating margin, which is why we improved our phasing increased Q2 and feel good about the line of sight we have to the back half of the year.\nTravis Steed: Super helpful. Thanks, Chris\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Good morning, Tom, and thanks for taking my question. My first one, Tom, if I just look at Q1 organic 2.4 right? A lot of questions on, look utilization is strong. Why is this optically 2.4 well below medtech sort of trends we've seen so-far. Can you help us bridge? I think you mentioned 150 basis points of respiratory, does that include COVID? I think you mentioned China. What was the China impact in Q1? I think you mentioned some timing elements, customer orders. What was that impact? And Alaris, it looks like it was not a contributor to growth, so maybe just help us draw bridge between the 2.4 and what it should have been without some of these underlying one-time items?\nTom Polen: Yeah. Great question, Vijay. Maybe just those two items that we've referenced, from the start of our guide, flu and China. Those two combined, if you take those out, it's about 5% underlying growth, just excluding those two items. So, those are quite significant. If you look at procedure volumes, etc., you're seeing that flow through in the base business where those two items aren't, so as an example, if you look in Interventional, you'll see that very strong growth in surgery, right, double-digit growth, which is getting the benefit of procedure volume. We're seeing in UCC, 9% growth there as an example, solid in PI, a little bit of inventory timing there, but we're seeing those factors play out. Again I\u2019d concentrate on those two topics, which again played out as we expected. The large flu compare just given the early timing last year in China, underlying was about five. Chris, do you have any comment?\nChristopher DelOrefice: No. Just I mean on Alaris, Alaris played out as expected actually. Again, what we've highlighted is, it was going to be a journey as you think of the natural progression of engaging with customers and the natural kind of life cycle of then placement, revenue recognition, etc. We're actually very pleased with our progress there. And as a matter of fact, right, we declared the $200 million more of a floor that was part of what gave us confidence to increase the low end of the revenue guide. And so we're continuing to focus on executing there and that was as expected on the flip side, what it does is, in the back half of the year, gives you almost basically a full point of growth tailwind that will help, which so, when you look at the back half, think of that or kind of moderate the expectation that you're seeing around feeling like that growth is outsized versus the front half of the year. It's as expected with the ramp we were expecting on Alaris.\nTom Polen: Yeah. I will turn it to Mike here. I think it's -- obviously, this is the first quarter that we've relaunched Alaris. And so the focus is first on engaging customers, getting agreements in place for remediation and upgrades. And that those are the key metrics that we look at in the first quarter of launch because that's what's indicating how the revenue is going to evolve in the back half of the year and that's what we, right, are feeling good about.\nMichael Garrison: That's right. And just to remind that last year, we had the Certificate of Medical Necessity, how we were shipping, we're not doing that now. So, it becomes more like a step over to get to there, and then growth on top of that, so that's what we're seeing in first quarter. So, it's actually, starting from ground zero in terms of selling process and ramping it up. I actually feel really good about that. I feel really pleased with the way our manufacturing ramp-up has gone and that scale-up is going quite well. So, we're able to supply product to our customers. I think the customer response, yeah, they're recognizing that, Alaris is almost like a different system. It's a different category in a way it's, the power of one with all the infusion modalities as a single system, the most advanced interoperability in the category, 750 live sites, order of magnitude more than anyone else. Yeah, so, it's almost being recognized a little differently that way, so that's good. And we have sort of exceeded, we set certain expectations, we've exceeded those relative to return to market in terms of upgrading the fleet in the field. So, it's early, but I think the way things have progressed, that's what -- those are the sort of the elements that led us to build confidence to say that we think 200 is the floor.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. And Chris, maybe one quick one for you. The margins still imply a 300 basis point step-up in back half versus your 2Q levels. Can you just talk -- I think inflation was part of it, but just maybe a similar bridge on margins from the '23 to '26 and back half?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Again, it's basically a continuation of Q2 when you move out of Q2, both FX, the inventory dynamic goes completely away, which is almost 75 basis points still in Q2, so right off the bat, you pick that up as you move through Q2. That's probably the biggest item FX continues to moderate. We have reasonable signals on FX, obviously can continue to move, but that moderates down. The other thing is outsized inflation moves from about 100 basis points, which is our full year average in Q2 that further moderates down significantly. And then again, if you just continue the cost improvement and margin improvement initiatives, we already executed in Q1 throughout the year, it gets you to where we need to be from a margin standpoint.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thanks, guys.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thanks, Vijay for the question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks, for taking the question. Mike, why would medical growth in fiscal '24 be in line with the corporate average given the tailwinds in MMS and pharm systems, you just said you expect pharm systems to grow high-single digits in 2024, so what are the expectations for MMS and MDS this year. Last year, Medical was 90%, was above the corporate average.\nMichael Garrison: Yeah. So for -- I'll talk first about, MDS. The business is actually showing really good momentum underlying which is masked a little bit by the impact of VOBP in China. So, that VOBP is a headwind for the year. Yeah. It's playing out as we expected, and built into our plan, but we're seeing strong momentum in the U.S., strong momentum, in catheters, and somewhat, driven by some of the new recent product launches that we've had. Site-Rite 9, Nexiva, NearPort, PIVO Pro, yeah these advancements are working out in the field and being very attractive to customers as we advance the One-Stick Hospital Stay vision. We're also watching injection systems and hypodermic. We're aware of some of the recent recalls, agency action in this area and we've ramped our capacity prepared to serve if market needs arise in the U.S. So, that's sort of, MDS. From MMS perspective, the way that I'm sort of seeing it and thinking about it as infusion sort of returning to be a contributor to growth versus maybe flat to a drag with return of Alaris. And then also, we're really excited for, very soon, our upcoming market release of the ex-U.S. infusion system BD neXus. Our dispensing business continues to perform very well. It's got solid growth both in the quarter, in hospital and alternate site. Our MedBank acquisition grew double-digits in the quarter, and continues to expand our presence in non-acute settings. So, I feel good about that. Pharmacy automation that proposition continues to resonate really well for both ROWA and Parata. As we noted previously and in the presentation, this quarter, last year was actually Parata's strong Q4 finish for their fiscal year. So, created a bit of a tough compare. This was expected and our timing ramp of installs is weighted more towards the back half. So, those are sort of the things that, give me confidence around, MDS and MMS.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That\u2019s helpful. And Tom, China was down 5% in this quarter in Q1. Talk about what you're seeing there and you're confidence. I think in the past, you said you expect China to be flat to up low-single digits this year. Thanks for taking the question.\nTom Polen: Yeah. Thanks, Larry. That expectation remains unchanged. China played out essentially exactly as we expected in the quarter was a little bit favorable to budget. What we saw and what we expected was VOBP, as Mike described, specifically within MDS which is where it's remained, we didn't see it expand to other areas at all. We're not seeing that it's -- our view is as we had projected. And we also expected to see strong growth in BDI which we've had over the last several years. We saw that play out in the quarter, mid-teens growth in BDI in Q1 and we saw solid growth, high -- very high single-digits on the cusp of double-digit growth in Life Sciences in China. And so that base business in China is continuing to do well. We'll -- we saw VOBP start in the back half of last year. And so again, that's going to become a tailwind for us as we think about compare in China as we go over that, so. Thanks for the question.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, I know we're in fiscal '24 here, but wanted to look out to '25, and based on operating margin guidance, it implies about 100 basis points expansion next year to get to your long range plan target. So, I'm sure the answer is pretty similar to the '24, but how do we think about the implied about 100 basis points next year and your confidence in that?\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah, Robbie. Thanks for the question. Actually, at J.P. Morgan, as you know, we outlined a strong plan outlining all of our margin improvement initiatives. I think gross margin is the next stage of accelerated focus for us and we already have a great pipeline of margin improvement initiatives there through Project Recode, right? We actually already completed our 20% goal SKU rationalization. We're actually going to go further there. The network architecture, Tom, highlighted in our prepared remarks the strong progress there with initiatives underway that reduced our network by 20%. As a matter of fact next year, the network architecture value we get out of that actually doubles going into '25, you're going to really start seeing the benefits of that. BD excellence is another one. We're getting great traction this year. It's part of the momentum we have in this year on margin that will continue into next year. You also have the Alaris dynamic. As that fully ramps up and scales, we'll get margin leverage there. So, all those things coupled with the continued strong growth profile of being able to consistently do 55 plus which we've been well above gives us strong confidence in 2025 and the 100 basis points, as a matter of fact, as we exit this year. Doing everything we did, we really should be well positioned to carry that kind of momentum into next year. It's premature to kind of make a formal commitment and manage all the puts and takes but certainly high confidence in the '25 and great momentum there.\nTom Polen: And maybe, Robbie and good morning. Just to add to Chris's good comments, I think another way just to think about it is, as we've launched BD 2025 in '22, it was a four-year road-map ahead, right? And so, the end of '24 will be 75% of the way through BD 2025. As you think about the margin number that we've set out as our guide for FY '24, that's 80% of the way through our margin goal, right? So from a timing perspective, 75% of the way through BD 2025, 80% of our margin goal, we are clearly on track, slightly ahead. And we're seeing really good momentum in our programs as evidenced this quarter. I think you've heard us talk about BD excellence. Obviously, as we started BD 2025, our focus was let's get Alaris back. Number one, take those learnings, apply them across the company to make sure we're building capabilities. Second was optimize our portfolio for growth spinning back up. Obviously, we sold the V. Mueller. We drove tuck-in M&A that's driving accretive growth, we rebalanced our R&D into high-growth spaces. And we've built our portfolio simplification programs starting with Recode which are on track and you're seeing those play out. Along the way and starting last year, we began to develop capabilities for BD Excellence, right? And it's our operating model -- operating system to drive a whole new scale of lean capabilities across the company. And last year, we had thousands of associates across the company engaged in BD Excellence. This year, we're really pressing the pedal on that program now as we've made progress on those first three areas that I mentioned. And so, as we said in the prepared remarks, if you think about the Kaizens that we did all of last year through BD Excellence, we did just as many in Q1 of this year just completed and that's going to continue to scale as we go through the year. And so, we see really good momentum there. It's giving us visibility not only on our '25 margin goal, those we also indicated, it's giving us visibility beyond '25 to continue, margin progression as we look ahead. So, thanks for the question, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Really helpful. Just a quick follow-up. China VBP is a headwind you've talked about. How do we think about where that's hitting each of the business units and the size, just so we can, kind of try and back out that headwind in our models? Thanks.\nTom Polen: Hey, Robbie. It's almost all within MDS specifically. Essentially, it is all within MDS. That's where we see it, so.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you. Two quick ones. I guess the first is Pharmacy Automation completely get the timing of year end and that side of things, but just curious, how you think things on orders, whether it's like order mix and kind of the outlook for the rest of the year based on, what you're hearing from the customers right now from the order book?\nMichael Garrison: Yeah. I'll take that. So for pharmacy automation, yeah, we feel really good on that, like I mentioned, the tough compare because, they were incentivized Parata and the team there was incentivized to finish their Q4 strong. So, they had already lined up installations last year for their finishing. They had a record for them quarter last year. So, it's a little bit of a tough compare. Order book looks good, especially in the sort of Retail Long-Term Care channels. Yeah. And we continue to leverage our BD Salesforce to talk to our acute-care customers about starting to transform the pharmacy in the acute care with our IDN customers. So, we see that continuing to grow throughout the year. Overall, it's been -- yeah, we've described it as sort of a low double-digit grower, and that's sort of what we have projected and expected for the rest of the year.\nPatrick Wood: Brilliant. And then maybe quickly one either you, Tom or Dave. Elience, Molecular Point-of-Care is obviously a very fast growing but very competitive market. Just curious, how you're seeing that product fit in, the interplay between like high and low plex? Just curious, how you're going to fit into that market? Thanks.\nTom Polen: I turn that to Dave. Thanks for the question, Patrick.\nDave Hickey: Thanks, Patrick and for picking up on Elience. Just take a step back. If you look at the molecular dynamics overall, we have said that this is one of the sort of six growth drivers for BD, right? So, we continue and if you look at the divergence of the market, there is real thesis playing out in terms of the way customer evolution will happen, right? So you think about the centralization of high-volume molecular cervical cancer testing, we satisfy that with BD COR. You think about BD MAX in the acute setting, and we're seeing good, as you heard Tom say in the prepared remarks, good double-digit growth there. But clearly, there is decentralization of relevant testing to the point-of-care and these new care settings. And obviously, Elience will be our entry there in this sort of high, you know, single-digit market. If I think about it specifically on Elience, the way to think about it is, what is different about it? Our goal here will be that we would anticipate it to be CLIA-waived giving critical results, within less than 15 minutes but can be used in a wide variety of settings. What is the unmet need that it will actually address and deliberately, we've actually selected CT/GC as our first assay because when you look at all the CDC and NIH reports, there is an increasing burden of STI. So, it will increase access to testing. And I think about it now, if you're one of those unfortunate patients and you're in the clinic, you could get that result diagnosed and a potential treatment administered while you're in a clinic in a decentralized setting. So, deliberately, we think CT/GC is really the right assay to lead with. And then, of course, because of the capabilities and these less than 15 minute results, we see a strong roadmap behind it, you know, focused on respiratory assays, other STI assays, vaginitis, etc.\nTom Polen: Yeah. That testing treat concept with 15 minutes or less time to [Multiple Speakers] core component.\nPatrick Wood: Love it. Thank you.\nTom Polen: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Miksic (ph) with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Polen: Good morning, Patrick. Sorry, Matthew.\nMatthew Miksic: This is Matt. It's okay. Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the factors that, play through Q1, you talked about last quarter and I have one follow-up. One was, obviously, a lot of detail and questions that came after around the peso and around wages. If you could just sort of -- you know, It sounds like you're most of the way through that and during Q2 and just maybe a quick update on that. And then the anti-coagulation business in China. I think there was something that you were hoping was going to find -- that capacity would find a new home, perhaps in this quarter or next quarter and an update on that. And then just one follow-up if I could.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. It's Chris. Thanks, Matt, for the question. Appreciate it. Yeah, when we started the year, we talked about kind of the inflationary dynamics and supply-chain. One of the biggest ones that we were still seeing play out through the year was wage dynamics in our supply-chain organization, that continues but it's playing out as expected. So, nothing new there. Regarding FX, good news is moderately favorable. We passed through both the revenue and earnings on that. So, stable at this point and moving in the right direction. We'll continue to watch it, and I think we're happy with the operational performance in passing through both the $0.07 operational beat and the $0.02 of FX.\nMatthew Miksic: And maybe Mike for pharm systems.\nMichael Garrison: Yeah. For pharm systems, that the capacity that's freed up for anti-coagulants, there is, some of it where the teams are, hunting for home for that. And there's been some success there, but I think we also just took a strategic decision to look at the anticoagulant market overall and it returning to more of a post-COVID normalization there and our converting lines over to biologics to help accelerate our ability to have capacity to serve in that area and that's playing out pretty well. So, we've been able to -- there has been some increased demand that's come in for biologics that, we'll be able to recognize later in the year and then, we'll be able to serve that, in part because of these line conversions. So, it's been a little bit of both relative to that anticoagulant dynamic.\nTom Polen: Thanks for the question, Matt.\nMatthew Miksic: That's super helpful. You bet. And just one follow-up if I could on cash flows and sort of M&A and I remember last quarter, Chris, you emphasized a bunch of times, and part of that impact was, bringing up excess inventory having an impact on margins, you threw that you made nice progress on leverage. Could you talk a little bit about, what that looks like for the rest of the year, drove M&A outlook and the kinds of things, maybe the size of things that you might be -- we might expect in the next, six, 12, 18 months. Thanks.\nChristopher DelOrefice: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. I appreciate you recognize. We've definitely been extremely focused on cash flow performance. I was really pleased with the quarter. There was really strong cash flow, strong double-digits, gives us confidence for the year. It played out in all the areas we've been trying to leverage. One, we're getting more efficient with our CapEx expenditures. Part of this is from a simplification efforts on BD Excellence that we're driving through our plans. In addition, you saw improvement in inventory and you saw improvement in our collection cycle as well. So, all really positive things. We sit basically at our net leverage target and so we're well positioned and consistently will remain disciplined as you think of M&A, but as you can imagine, we always have an active portfolio of things that we look at. We're going to remain disciplined. It's been a nice contributor organically to growth last year, delivered nearly 40 basis points. So, certainly something that we're going to continue to focus on as part of our growth strategy and more to come on that. Tom, I don't know if you want to add?\nTom Polen: Extremely well said. Remains an active part of our growth strategy and I think as we've shared in the past, we've been focused on accretive growth, accretive margin acquisitions, which has been our track record and we've executed well against those over the last several years. I think we've clearly built a good track record of that. And so, we've got a strong healthy M&A, you know, active pipeline focused again in strategic areas where the market has significant structural or macro tailwinds to drive sustainable growth and where we can bring meaningful additional value either through our channel or global footprint, our manufacturing prowess. And again, we remain very disciplined on strong returns accretive growth. We haven't been doing dilutive deals that remains, right? Our emphasis is we're focused on delivering on our 25% operating margin goals. And but we're going to continue to focus on that and we have a strong pipeline. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And this time, I'll return the call to Tom for any closing comments.\nTom Polen: Thank you all for joining our call. As you heard, we had good momentum to start the year and we look forward to sharing our progress towards delivering our BD 2025 goals and increased outlook for FY '24 on our next call in May. Thank you very much and have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. On behalf of BD, thank you for joining today.

So for -- I'll talk first about, MDS. The business is actually showing really good momentum underlying which is masked a little bit by the impact of VOBP in China. So, that VOBP is a headwind for the year. Yeah. It's playing out as we expected, and built into our plan, but we're seeing strong momentum in the U.S., strong momentum, in catheters, and somewhat, driven by some of the new recent product launches that we've had. Site-Rite 9, Nexiva, NearPort, PIVO Pro, yeah these advancements are working out in the field and being very attractive to customers as we advance the One-Stick Hospital Stay vision. We're also watching injection systems and hypodermic. We're aware of some of the recent recalls, agency action in this area and we've ramped our capacity prepared to serve if market needs arise in the U.S. So, that's sort of, MDS. From MMS perspective, the way that I'm sort of seeing it and thinking about it as infusion sort of returning to be a contributor to growth versus maybe flat to a drag with return of Alaris. And then also, we're really excited for, very soon, our upcoming market release of the ex-U.S. infusion system BD neXus. Our dispensing business continues to perform very well. It's got solid growth both in the quarter, in hospital and alternate site. Our MedBank acquisition grew double-digits in the quarter, and continues to expand our presence in non-acute settings. So, I feel good about that. Pharmacy automation that proposition continues to resonate really well for both ROWA and Parata. As we noted previously and in the presentation, this quarter, last year was actually Parata's strong Q4 finish for their fiscal year. So, created a bit of a tough compare. This was expected and our timing ramp of installs is weighted more towards the back half. So, those are sort of the things that, give me confidence around, MDS and MMS. Yeah. I'll take that.

Total revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations. And on the bottom line, adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin goals through our BD Excellence operating system and the timing of discrete tax item. Also consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong growth in cash flow that positions us well to deliver another year of growing free cash flow double-digits. I want to thank our team of over 70,000 associates for the strong execution, agility and unrelenting determination to deliver for our customers, patients and shareholders. These results give us the confidence to increase our FY '24 guidance. Turning to our BD 2025 strategy. During Q1, we continued to execute well against the five actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes continuing to advance our innovation pipeline which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted revenue growth profile. We remain focused on advancing innovation in high growth areas, anchored against three irreversible forces we see reshaping healthcare today and over the next decade, connected care, new care settings and chronic disease. Specifically in Q1, we made meaningful progress achieving several key R&D milestones for technologies that position BD as key enablers of care shift in new settings. In our PureWick portfolio, which is now the market's leading platform for non-invasive urine management in a billion dollar market growing double-digits. We started our randomized clinical trial pilots for PureWick Female to generate evidence to support future at-home reimbursement. Our PureWick program is progressing well and we remain on track to launch our next-generation Female External Catheter later this fiscal year, which will provide a better patient experience in a more dignified way for women to manage their urinary incontinence. In Q1, we received 510(k) clearance for our new BD MiniDraw Capillary Blood Collection System. Based on a recent study, two-thirds of patients prefer MiniDraw's finger-stick collection in a retail setting over a previous experience with the traditional Venous blood draw. Since it does not require a phlebotomist, MiniDraw can expand access to sample collection for several routine blood tests to new settings such as retail clinics and pharmacies. And lastly, in molecular diagnostics, we initiated clinical trial enrollment for the BD Elience Point-of-Care Molecular platform. In our first assay, a rapid CT/GC test for in-office testing and treatment. BD Elience enables BD to enter into the high growth molecular point-of-care market. We continue to see molecular diagnostics as a strong growth catalyst as evidenced by double-digit growth this quarter in our BD COR and BD MAX platforms where we continue to leverage our growing installed base through menu expansion with more than 20 assays currently available on BD MAX. Both NextGen PureWick and BD MiniDraw are on track to launch later this fiscal year and we anticipate our first 510(k) submission for the BD Elience system and our first assay this fiscal year as well. Regarding Alaris, servicing our customers and bringing all Alaris pumps in the field up to the cleared standard remains our priority. Customer response has been very positive with strong momentum, engaging with customers. And while it is still early in the process, I'm pleased with our progress and as we recently shared, we now believe $200 million as the floor on revenue in fiscal '24. We are also executing well on our broad simplification strategy to drive margin expansion and a double-digit base EPS CAGR through FY '25. This includes accelerating adoption of our BD Excellence Operating System, which focuses on the application of lean principles to drive excellence everywhere, every day across our plants and business and is driving productivity gains across our operations. In FY '23, we held 18 week-long Kaizen events. And in Q1 FY '24 alone, we executed as many, a trajectory, which will continue through the rest of FY '24. We've deployed this mindset outside of our factories, driving greater efficiency through the organization at all levels. Our BD Excellence Operating System is an important new capability we're building to drive a world-class culture of continuous improvement and lean management throughout BD. We also progressed our Project Recode initiatives including our network optimization effort to drive plant efficiencies. We have multiple site consolidations either completed or underway to reduce our footprint by approximately 20%. The combination of BD Excellence with our recode network architecture program is supporting our FY '24 goals, contributing to our plan for 25% operating margins in FY '25. And also, now providing visibility for continued margin expansion beyond FY '25. We're also seeing our systematic focus on cash flow continuing to yield results. Through working capital efficiencies and our BD Excellence Operating System, driving more efficient CapEx spend, we delivered over $850 million in operating cash flows in Q1. This strong execution to start the year positions us well to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flows in FY '24 and positions us to capitalize on M&A opportunities in higher growth categories and opportunistically return cash to shareholders. Lastly, our teams around the world continue to make meaningful advancements on our ESG strategy. Just last week, we announced a collaboration with the Kenyan government to advance access to critical cancer diagnostics for women in Kenya through self-sampling, furthering our commitment to expanding health equity and access around the world. We see the power of the cell sampling model is applicable across other underserved markets, as well as in the U.S. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q1 and the solid margin execution, which enables us to raise guidance for fiscal 2024. With strong progress of our innovation pipeline and growing momentum from BD Excellence and our simplification programs, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD 2025 goals. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rick, and good to connect. So, as you said, Q1 played out as expected, total revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations, as you said, there were really two factors that we recognize we're going to be playing out in Q1. One was the flu compare given the large kind of early timing last year that was about 150 basis points that we knew was going to happen and then value-based procurement in China. And those two factors played out actually exactly as we expected in China, in fact that we were watching that and we saw VOBP stay focused within MDS which was just our assumption. We had really strong growth in BDI within the quarter, double-digit, mid-teen growth, high-single digit growth in life sciences and so we saw that play out. China actually did a little bit better than budgeted in Q1 and so we feel good that that's going to continue to play out for the year. I think, as we also think about the back part of the year to your question, something else we are looking at as we started and gave guidance to begin, '24 was, of course, Alaris. We were really pleased to have Alaris back with new improvements. Our new 510(k), it's a big deal to be back servicing our customers fully. It's a great product and highly unique and so, of course, Q1 was really the first quarter with Alaris relaunched and our team backed it proactively upgrading and remediating our base and we wanted to get feedback and engagement. And it's been quite positive, and I think that part also, as we look ahead, that confidence in those early engagements and the progress we're making is what's led us to also comment that we're seeing now $200 million as the floor for the year. In the other aspects, as you think about the growth drivers that we've been talking about and we often call out six specific platforms, we saw a really great growth in PureWick this quarter. Pharm systems, we have signaled very clearly the anticoagulant topic that was going to create a slower compare or slower growth in Q1. We're seeing the underlying business there do really well. Biologics grew double-digits in the quarter. Flow playing out, strong demand for FACSDiscover, Molecular double-digit growth as you heard in the prepared remarks, Peripheral Vascular and Pharmacy Automation, those trends in the marketplace continue with strong outlooks for those businesses. So again, we saw very clearly the two factors that we knew were going to impact us in Q1 and they played out as expected. Chris, any other comments to add. Thanks for the question, Rick. Yeah, Travis. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. Good morning. So, on pharm systems specifically, again, as I mentioned, we saw that play out as expected with the impact of the one customer that we mentioned in anticoagulants and strong underlying growth beyond that, again, double-digit growth in biologics. Our capacity continues to -- those investments that we made continue to play out as expected. We have capacity to meet customer needs, and we're engaged very actively in that space. And as we think about the slight raise on revenue, again, we feel really Alaris the floor of 200, as we see now for the year based on, again, early engagement with customers. We thought that was prudent to do given our outlook in that space. I don't know, Mike, if you have any other comments to add. Yeah. Great question, Vijay. Maybe just those two items that we've referenced, from the start of our guide, flu and China. Those two combined, if you take those out, it's about 5% underlying growth, just excluding those two items. So, those are quite significant. If you look at procedure volumes, etc., you're seeing that flow through in the base business where those two items aren't, so as an example, if you look in Interventional, you'll see that very strong growth in surgery, right, double-digit growth, which is getting the benefit of procedure volume. We're seeing in UCC, 9% growth there as an example, solid in PI, a little bit of inventory timing there, but we're seeing those factors play out. Again I'd concentrate on those two topics, which again played out as we expected. The large flu compare just given the early timing last year in China, underlying was about five. Chris, do you have any comment? Yeah. I will turn it to Mike here. I think it's -- obviously, this is the first quarter that we've relaunched Alaris. And so the focus is first on engaging customers, getting agreements in place for remediation and upgrades. And that those are the key metrics that we look at in the first quarter of launch because that's what's indicating how the revenue is going to evolve in the back half of the year and that's what we, right, are feeling good about. Yeah. Thanks, Larry. That expectation remains unchanged. China played out essentially exactly as we expected in the quarter was a little bit favorable to budget. What we saw and what we expected was VOBP, as Mike described, specifically within MDS which is where it's remained, we didn't see it expand to other areas at all. We're not seeing that it's -- our view is as we had projected. And we also expected to see strong growth in BDI which we've had over the last several years. We saw that play out in the quarter, mid-teens growth in BDI in Q1 and we saw solid growth, high -- very high single-digits on the cusp of double-digit growth in Life Sciences in China. And so that base business in China is continuing to do well. We'll -- we saw VOBP start in the back half of last year. And so again, that's going to become a tailwind for us as we think about compare in China as we go over that, so. Thanks for the question. And maybe, Robbie and good morning. Just to add to Chris's good comments, I think another way just to think about it is, as we've launched BD 2025 in '22, it was a four-year road-map ahead, right? And so, the end of '24 will be 75% of the way through BD 2025. As you think about the margin number that we've set out as our guide for FY '24, that's 80% of the way through our margin goal, right? So from a timing perspective, 75% of the way through BD 2025, 80% of our margin goal, we are clearly on track, slightly ahead. And we're seeing really good momentum in our programs as evidenced this quarter. I think you've heard us talk about BD excellence. Obviously, as we started BD 2025, our focus was let's get Alaris back. Number one, take those learnings, apply them across the company to make sure we're building capabilities. Second was optimize our portfolio for growth spinning back up. Obviously, we sold the V. Mueller. We drove tuck-in M&A that's driving accretive growth, we rebalanced our R&D into high-growth spaces. And we've built our portfolio simplification programs starting with Recode which are on track and you're seeing those play out. Along the way and starting last year, we began to develop capabilities for BD Excellence, right? And it's our operating model -- operating system to drive a whole new scale of lean capabilities across the company. And last year, we had thousands of associates across the company engaged in BD Excellence. This year, we're really pressing the pedal on that program now as we've made progress on those first three areas that I mentioned. And so, as we said in the prepared remarks, if you think about the Kaizens that we did all of last year through BD Excellence, we did just as many in Q1 of this year just completed and that's going to continue to scale as we go through the year. And so, we see really good momentum there. It's giving us visibility not only on our '25 margin goal, those we also indicated, it's giving us visibility beyond '25 to continue, margin progression as we look ahead. So, thanks for the question, Robbie. Hey, Robbie. It's almost all within MDS specifically. Essentially, it is all within MDS. That's where we see it, so. Thanks. I turn that to Dave. Thanks for the question, Patrick. Yeah. That testing treat concept with 15 minutes or less time to [Multiple Speakers] core component. Thank you. Good morning, Patrick. Sorry, Matthew. Thanks for the question, Matt. Extremely well said. Remains an active part of our growth strategy and I think as we've shared in the past, we've been focused on accretive growth, accretive margin acquisitions, which has been our track record and we've executed well against those over the last several years. I think we've clearly built a good track record of that. And so, we've got a strong healthy M&A, you know, active pipeline focused again in strategic areas where the market has significant structural or macro tailwinds to drive sustainable growth and where we can bring meaningful additional value either through our channel or global footprint, our manufacturing prowess. And again, we remain very disciplined on strong returns accretive growth. We haven't been doing dilutive deals that remains, right? Our emphasis is we're focused on delivering on our 25% operating margin goals. And but we're going to continue to focus on that and we have a strong pipeline. Thanks for the question. Thank you all for joining our call. As you heard, we had good momentum to start the year and we look forward to sharing our progress towards delivering our BD 2025 goals and increased outlook for FY '24 on our next call in May. Thank you very much and have a great rest of the day."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well against our performance goals in Q1. Q1 revenue growth was largely as we expected and I'm pleased to share we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered strong cash flow that positions us well to support our double-digit free cash flow growth goal. I'll now provide some insight into our revenue performance in the quarter. Additional detail can be found in today's earnings' announcement and presentation. Q1 revenue was $4.7 billion with organic growth of 2.4% that was driven by high-single digit organic growth in BD Interventional and solid growth in BD Medical with China market dynamics playing out as expected, partially offset by a decline in BD Life Sciences, which was impacted by the comparison to the prior year respiratory season. As expected, China and respiratory were the primary drivers of Q1 revenue growth under indexing our full year goal. The respiratory season alone impacted total company growth by about 150 basis points. Regionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., EMEA and Latin America, partially offset by the expected decline in China. Total Q1 revenue growth of 1.6% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. Turning to the segment performance. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 2.4%, driven by growth and medication management solutions and pharmaceutical systems, min-single digit growth in MMS was led by strong performance in dispensing, driven by innovations in our BD Pyxis portfolio that are improving nursing workflows and efficiencies. In our infusion business, we are pleased with our strong progress, bringing the BD Alaris Infusion System back to the market and continue to expect Alaris to ramp over the course of the year. Infusion also reflects strong demand for IV sets. Performance in Pharmacy Automation reflects the comparison to an outsized quarter in the prior year and the timing of planned capital installations. Growth of 3.4% in Pharmaceutical Systems was in line with our expectations and was led by strong double-digit growth in pre-filled devices for biologics and as expected, was partially offset by customer inventory dynamics, including a slowdown in demand for anticoagulants. Growth in Medication Delivery Solutions was about flat and slightly ahead of our expectations. Our Vascular Access Management strategy continues to drive strong performance particularly in Catheter Solutions. As expected, MDS growth was impacted by market dynamics in China including volume based procurement, which continues to play out within our expectations. BD Life Sciences revenue of $1.3 billion declined 2.5% which reflects a decline in IDS as a result of a tough comparison in the respiratory season worth nearly 500 basis points. It was partially offset by strong growth in biosciences. Performance in IDS reflects the tough comparison in respiratory testing that was partially offset by high-single digit growth in our Microbiology platforms and double-digit growth in Molecular IVD assays on both our BD MAX and BD COR platforms. Biosciences grew 5.7% as expected despite a strong comparison in the prior year. BDB performance was driven by strong mid-single digit growth in our research and clinical platforms that reflects double-digit growth in research instruments, driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter and double-digit growth in Clinical Reagents as we continue to leverage our growing installed base of FACSLyric and FACSDuet solutions. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 4.7% and 8.4% organic, which excludes the impact of the surgical instruments divestiture. BDI organic growth was led by surgery and UCC. In surgery, double-digit organic growth was led by continued market adoption of our leading Phasix resorbable hernia products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. High-single digit growth in urology was led by strong double-digit growth in our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions with continued strong demand in both the acute care and home care settings. Mid-single digit growth in PI was in line with our expectations and reflects growth across the portfolio. It was partially offset by the expected timing of distributor orders. In our peripheral vascular disease platform, we continue to drive market penetration with our Rotarex Atherectomy System and our Venous portfolio. Performance in our oncology business was driven by growth in biopsy, including strong market acceptance of our recently launched BD Trek powered bone biopsy system. Now moving to our P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 51.1% and adjusted operating margin of 20.2% were ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin improvement goals across our portfolio of simplification initiatives and strong SSG&A expense leverage. R&D spend was in line with our expectations. In addition, as we previously shared a discrete tax item that was contemplated in our full-year tax rate was realized in Q1. As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q1 operating income and our adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in an EPS of $2.68. Regarding our cash and capital allocation, Q1 cash flows from operations totaled over $850 million. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including good management of inventory levels, continued discipline around CapEx investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefit from our simplification programs and BD Excellence Operating System. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and expect another step improvement in FY '24. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we also remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%. Beyond our investments in growth, we returned $775 million in capital to shareholders, including dividends and $500 million in share repurchases. We ended Q1 with a cash balance of $1.2 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7 times. Moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Based on our Q1 performance, including the strong momentum in many parts of our business and progression of our margin improvement initiatives, we raised the midpoint of our FY '24 organic revenue growth guidance, and raised our adjusted EPS guidance, increasing the midpoint by $0.09. The increase to adjusted EPS reflects Q1 operational outperformance and a small improvement in FX. As a result, we now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 6.25%, which increases our midpoint to slightly above 5.8%. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS, including the impact of currency to be in a range of $12.82 to $13.06, which reflects about $12.94 at the midpoint. Regarding foreign currency based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency has improved modestly and for the full year is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 25 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 360 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis. As you think of phasing over the balance of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations. First, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the expected ramp in Alaris along with the easing of prior year comparisons, such as China. Second, our updated guidance reflects an improved margin cadence over the balance of the year. Specific to Q2, adjusted gross margin is in line with our prior expectation and continues to reflect significant sequential improvement given the lessening impacts from inflation, prior year inventory reductions and FX. We now expect Q2 adjusted operating margin to expand by 25 basis points to 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued margin improvement efforts and continued leverage in SSG&A. Third, the discrete tax item realized in Q1 was largely a shift from Q2 and results and revised phasing of our full year effective tax rate. Based on this timing dynamic, we currently expect our Q2 tax rate to be nearly 17%. We expect strong operating performance to offset the tax phasing impact, and as a result, there are no changes to our expectations for Q2 adjusted earnings per share. Lastly, we remain confident in delivering about 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the year. As a reminder, the first half inventory impact is transitory and behind us as we exit Q2. And as FX and inflation moderate at a meaningful rate to the back half, coupled with a continuation of the first half margin improvement, we expect to deliver from our strong simplification portfolio, we can naturally achieve our second half margin goals. In summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and new innovation, we have clear line of sight to deliver our FY '24 revenue guide which at the midpoint is above our 5.5% plus target and results in a three year CAGR of nearly 7% growth. I'm pleased with the continued strong execution by our talented organization to start the year, which supported over delivering on our margin and operating income goals and increasing our earnings outlook. With a strong quarter of cash flow, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth, which increases our capacity to support additional value creating opportunities including M&A. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver against our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue? Good morning, Rick. I mean, just, sometimes, it's easier just play bigger picture right. I'm sure you're looking at our balance to go plans which we are very confident into Tom's point. We've expressed confidence in Alaris and establishing a floor now. I think the Alaris dynamics important. If you look at the balance to go, it's about 7% revenue growth. Last two years, we delivered right around 7%. This year, actually, if you think about it, Alaris is going to cycle over medical necessity. It's not a significant contributor to growth in the first half despite seeing very strong progress, but what that does is it adds about a point to growth more in the second half, right? So, we see really good momentum there. So when you think of sort of Alaris adjusted, you're at six and we cycle over the China compare in Q4, which have declined as well. So, I think plans are intact, the strong underlying fundamentals in kind of these six key areas we keep pointing to, like, Tom mentioned in biologics are well positioned and feel good about the rest of the year. Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. We were definitely pleased with the margin progression and operating income delivery Q1 and it was strong and exceeded expectations. We basically passed that through to your point. The other thing we did is we actually accelerated margin improvement in Q2 by about 25 basis points to 50 basis points, so de-risks the back half of the year. We did that on a couple of things. Whenever you start the year, you want to ask -- you want to see a couple of things. One, to recall some of these transitory headwinds like China. We knew we had a transitory item in inventory that hit us in the first quarter that was 200 basis points. We have outsized FX in the quarter. All those played out as expected and we have stronger delivery on calling inflation dynamics and more importantly, our margin improvement program. So, we continue to accelerate those. We've had two years now of consistent track record of delivering against our margin expectations, back to pre-pandemic levels 400 basis points over two years. If you look at our margin progression throughout the year, basically, with these transitory items behind you, the level of cost improvement we delivered in Q1 alone with moderating outsized inflation through the back half of the year. It goes from nearly -- in Q1, we said it was almost 2x what we're calling for the full year and outsized inflation 100 basis points. It cuts in half in Q2 and then moderates in the back half. So, we just have to keep executing against our margin improvement portfolio, which is really strong. And that's what gave us confidence with the Q1 performance and our ongoing programs to raise for the year and we're focused on executing against that. Yeah. Thanks, Travis. So, first of all, in the quarter, it wasn't one thing. I'd just say execution is kind of the theme here, organization is hyper focused consistent with what we've done is predominantly our cost improvement programs. We had some mix benefit as well which has been part of our strategy on portfolio as well. So, all of that, I would say, the headwinds kind of played out as expected and we over delivered through good focus, execution on our margin improvement initiatives. To your point, the Q1 step-up, the step-up from Q1 to Q2 about 300 basis points that we've signaled. If you think of it this way, again, we had two, what I would call, pretty transitory items in Q1. We have the outsized FX, coupled with the inventory reduction in absorption dynamic. Those two items alone as you head into Q2 are about 30%, so as we're 400 basis points. They're only about 30% of that value in Q2. So, you pick up momentum there, coupled with the fact that the outsized inflation, which was almost 2x, what we call, for the year in Q1. It starts moderating significantly almost in half in Q2 and then it further moderates by the back half of the year. So really, it's just cycling over those kind of one-time items, outsized inflation moderating back and us continuing to deliver what we already delivered in Q1. So, we're confident that that progression continues. With that, you naturally get the sequential step-up that we're driving towards. And again, feel good about our operating margin, which is why we improved our phasing increased Q2 and feel good about the line of sight we have to the back half of the year. No. Just I mean on Alaris, Alaris played out as expected actually. Again, what we've highlighted is, it was going to be a journey as you think of the natural progression of engaging with customers and the natural kind of life cycle of then placement, revenue recognition, etc. We're actually very pleased with our progress there. And as a matter of fact, right, we declared the $200 million more of a floor that was part of what gave us confidence to increase the low end of the revenue guide. And so we're continuing to focus on executing there and that was as expected on the flip side, what it does is, in the back half of the year, gives you almost basically a full point of growth tailwind that will help, which so, when you look at the back half, think of that or kind of moderate the expectation that you're seeing around feeling like that growth is outsized versus the front half of the year. It's as expected with the ramp we were expecting on Alaris. Yeah. Again, it's basically a continuation of Q2 when you move out of Q2, both FX, the inventory dynamic goes completely away, which is almost 75 basis points still in Q2, so right off the bat, you pick that up as you move through Q2. That's probably the biggest item FX continues to moderate. We have reasonable signals on FX, obviously can continue to move, but that moderates down. The other thing is outsized inflation moves from about 100 basis points, which is our full year average in Q2 that further moderates down significantly. And then again, if you just continue the cost improvement and margin improvement initiatives, we already executed in Q1 throughout the year, it gets you to where we need to be from a margin standpoint. Thanks, Vijay for the question. Thank you. Yeah, Robbie. Thanks for the question. Actually, at J.P. Morgan, as you know, we outlined a strong plan outlining all of our margin improvement initiatives. I think gross margin is the next stage of accelerated focus for us and we already have a great pipeline of margin improvement initiatives there through Project Recode, right? We actually already completed our 20% goal SKU rationalization. We're actually going to go further there. The network architecture, Tom, highlighted in our prepared remarks the strong progress there with initiatives underway that reduced our network by 20%. As a matter of fact next year, the network architecture value we get out of that actually doubles going into '25, you're going to really start seeing the benefits of that. BD excellence is another one. We're getting great traction this year. It's part of the momentum we have in this year on margin that will continue into next year. You also have the Alaris dynamic. As that fully ramps up and scales, we'll get margin leverage there. So, all those things coupled with the continued strong growth profile of being able to consistently do 55 plus which we've been well above gives us strong confidence in 2025 and the 100 basis points, as a matter of fact, as we exit this year. Doing everything we did, we really should be well positioned to carry that kind of momentum into next year. It's premature to kind of make a formal commitment and manage all the puts and takes but certainly high confidence in the '25 and great momentum there. Yeah. It's Chris. Thanks, Matt, for the question. Appreciate it. Yeah, when we started the year, we talked about kind of the inflationary dynamics and supply-chain. One of the biggest ones that we were still seeing play out through the year was wage dynamics in our supply-chain organization, that continues but it's playing out as expected. So, nothing new there. Regarding FX, good news is moderately favorable. We passed through both the revenue and earnings on that. So, stable at this point and moving in the right direction. We'll continue to watch it, and I think we're happy with the operational performance in passing through both the $0.07 operational beat and the $0.02 of FX. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. I appreciate you recognize. We've definitely been extremely focused on cash flow performance. I was really pleased with the quarter. There was really strong cash flow, strong double-digits, gives us confidence for the year. It played out in all the areas we've been trying to leverage. One, we're getting more efficient with our CapEx expenditures. Part of this is from a simplification efforts on BD Excellence that we're driving through our plans. In addition, you saw improvement in inventory and you saw improvement in our collection cycle as well. So, all really positive things. We sit basically at our net leverage target and so we're well positioned and consistently will remain disciplined as you think of M&A, but as you can imagine, we always have an active portfolio of things that we look at. We're going to remain disciplined. It's been a nice contributor organically to growth last year, delivered nearly 40 basis points. So, certainly something that we're going to continue to focus on as part of our growth strategy and more to come on that. Tom, I don't know if you want to add?"

            "name": "Dave Hickey",
            "content": "Thanks, Patrick and for picking up on Elience. Just take a step back. If you look at the molecular dynamics overall, we have said that this is one of the sort of six growth drivers for BD, right? So, we continue and if you look at the divergence of the market, there is real thesis playing out in terms of the way customer evolution will happen, right? So you think about the centralization of high-volume molecular cervical cancer testing, we satisfy that with BD COR. You think about BD MAX in the acute setting, and we're seeing good, as you heard Tom say in the prepared remarks, good double-digit growth there. But clearly, there is decentralization of relevant testing to the point-of-care and these new care settings. And obviously, Elience will be our entry there in this sort of high, you know, single-digit market. If I think about it specifically on Elience, the way to think about it is, what is different about it? Our goal here will be that we would anticipate it to be CLIA-waived giving critical results, within less than 15 minutes but can be used in a wide variety of settings. What is the unmet need that it will actually address and deliberately, we've actually selected CT/GC as our first assay because when you look at all the CDC and NIH reports, there is an increasing burden of STI. So, it will increase access to testing. And I think about it now, if you're one of those unfortunate patients and you're in the clinic, you could get that result diagnosed and a potential treatment administered while you're in a clinic in a decentralized setting. So, deliberately, we think CT/GC is really the right assay to lead with. And then, of course, because of the capabilities and these less than 15 minute results, we see a strong roadmap behind it, you know, focused on respiratory assays, other STI assays, vaginitis, etc."
